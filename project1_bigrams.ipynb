to operations in the gulf of mexico.\\n\\nthree states -- massachusetts, california and connecticut -- have\\nlegalized same-sex marriage. and now, three states, california\\namong them, have proposals on their ballots this month to ban gay\\nmarriage.\\n\\nbut given that the federal government views same-sex married\\ncouples as perfect strangers, ineligible for the many federal\\nrights given to opposite-sex married couples, the question for gay\\ncouples is this: is it worth it to tie the knot?\\n\\nfor many couples, the answer is a resounding yes: the word\\n\"married\" itself instantly conveys something that civil unions\\nand domestic partnerships do not.\\n\\nyet purely from a financial perspective, it\\'s hard to come to\\nany sweeping conclusions. for couples living in states that offer\\nmarriage or civil unions -- which provide many of the same rights as\\nmarriage -- it definitely makes sense for them to be married if they\\nhave children, according to financial planners and estate planning\\nlawyers. those who make their relationship official may pay\\nsignificantly less in state estate taxes. they will also gain\\nimportant privileges, including hospital visitation rights and the\\nability to make medical decisions for a partner in emergencies.\\n\\nstill, the many rights that marriage confers vaporize the moment\\ncouples step into a state that does not recognize their unions.\\n\\nit is a tricky path to navigate, given the patchwork of state\\nlaws and varying grades of benefits they provide. besides the three\\nstates that allow marriage -- connecticut made it legal in october --\\nnew jersey, new hampshire and vermont allow civil unions, which\\ngenerally approximate marriage. oregon provides something similar,\\nbut calls it domestic partnership. the district of columbia,\\nhawaii, maine, washington and other jurisdictions provide certain\\nrights under domestic partnership laws. the constant state of flux,\\nas illustrated by this year\\'s ballot, makes it all the more\\ncomplicated.\\n\\n\"it really depends on where you are standing,\" said david\\nbuckel, marriage project director and senior counsel at lambda\\nlegal in new york. \"more than 40 states have passed statutes to\\nconfirm that same-sex couples are not allowed to marry.\"\\n\\nthere are also certain reasons not to marry. it could ruin your\\nchances of adopting a child from abroad, for example, because many\\ncountries do not allow openly gay couples to adopt.\\n\\nmany couples make the leap, even knowing their legal standing\\nwill not be equal to that of opposite-sex couples. jeff friedman\\nand andrew zwerin, both 40 and residents of rockville centre, n.y.,\\ndecided to marry as soon as california legalized it in may. they\\nwere wed in palos verdes estates, calif., on oct. 12.\\n\\ntheir new status means they can qualify for lower car insurance\\npremiums because they are no longer considered \"single males.\"\\nand they hope their marriage will give them more legal standing if\\ntheir son, joshua, 5, lands in the emergency room because of his\\nasthma. the last time he was admitted, the pediatric nurse told the\\ntwo dads that she needed to speak with the child\\'s mother.\\n\\nbut, friedman said, they are well aware that their marriage\\ncarries no weight when it comes to, say, filing their federal tax\\nreturn (though they can file a joint state tax return, which will\\nallow them to keep more of their earnings). and the marriage\\ncertificate is flimsy when the couple leaves new york, which honors\\nsame-sex marriages performed elsewhere. on family vacations, the\\npair will continue to bring along a slightly torn manila folder,\\nstuffed with documentation -- birth certificates, health care\\nproxies, powers of attorney and all of their son\\'s adoption records\\n-- that proves they are a family.\\n\\n\"our hope is that also providing a marriage license might help\\nprovide additional documentation for proof of how we are all\\nrelated,\" friedman said. \"i want to make sure my son is taken\\ncare of if something were to happen to me.\"\\n\\nthe list below outlines the benefits same-sex married couples\\n(and those with civil unions) generally receive, as well as what\\nthey still need to be concerned about. these issues are not as\\ncomplicated for opposite-sex couples, because they receive many\\nmore rights when they marry, regardless of where they live, and\\nthose rights are broadly recognized.\\n\\nmedical power of attorney\\n\\nmarried or not, all committed same-sex couples should consider a\\npower of attorney for health care or medical matters, which\\nappoints a person to make medical decisions for you when you cannot\\ndo so. it is also known as a health care proxy, among other things,\\ndepending on where you live. the document should include an\\nauthorization under the health insurance portability and\\naccountability act to provide access to medical records. you may\\nalso include a hospital visitation directive to specify who can\\nvisit you in the hospital.\\n\\nanother important document is a living will, which specifies\\nwhich medical procedures may or may not be done. \"it is an\\nimportant document for anyone, but more so for same-sex couples\\nbecause we could have family members come in and say, \\'no, i know\\nbetter and this person has absolutely no standing,\"\\' said james\\ntissot, a new york financial planner.\\n\\ndurable power of attorney\\n\\nif one partner becomes incapacitated, a durable power of\\nattorney gives the other partner authority to handle financial and\\nlegal affairs, like paying bills.\\n\\nwills and trusts\\n\\nbeing married in a state that recognizes your union does not\\nguarantee that all your assets will go to your partner. (this goes\\nfor heterosexual couples as well.) a will directs how your assets\\nwill be distributed after you die and allows you to name a guardian\\nfor your children. a revocable living trust, on the other hand, is\\nviewed as more difficult to contest than a will, and it avoids the\\nsometimes lengthy and expensive legal process to settle a deceased\\nperson\\'s estate. with a revocable living trust, you basically put\\nall your assets in the trust, and the trustee you name distributes\\nthem according to your directions after you die.\\n\\n\"people just assume they don\\'t need to have legal documents\\ndrafted if they are in a civil union or a marriage, and that is an\\nentirely wrong assumption,\" said debra neiman, a financial planner\\nin arlington, mass.\\n\\nretirement\\n\\nsince same-sex married couples are not eligible for social\\nsecurity survivor benefits, they may need to save more or make\\nspecial arrangements -- like purchasing life insurance -- to be sure\\nthe survivor has enough financial resources if one partner should\\ndie. for instance, if one partner is a stay-at-home parent, that\\npartner will not qualify for the wage-earning spouse\\'s higher\\nsocial security benefits if the wage earner dies first, said peter\\nberkery, author of two books on financial planning for same-sex\\ncouples.\\n\\nproperty ownership\\n\\nsame-sex couples, married or not, need to take extra care when\\ntitling their property, especially their homes. heterosexual\\nmarried couples can transfer real estate and personal property to\\neach other with no gift taxes and no estate taxes until the second\\nspouse dies. same-sex married couples and those with equivalent\\nrights living in states that recognize them have this benefit only\\non the state level. but property passing to a same-sex spouse is\\nstill subject to federal estate taxes upon the first spouse\\'s\\ndeath. in 2008, federal estate taxes apply for assets valued at\\nmore than $2 million. adding a same-sex spouse to the title of your\\nhome may also have tax implications because it would be considered\\na gift.\\n\\ninsurance\\n\\nsame-sex couples, married or not, should consider what types of\\ninsurance they need to make up for benefits that go only to\\nstraight married couples. life insurance can be used to compensate\\nfor certain retirement benefits or to cover federal estate taxes.\\n\\ndisability insurance may also be a wise purchase. normally,\\nmarried people qualify for some social security benefits if their\\nspouses become disabled, especially if their children are young.\\nbut same-sex spouses do not qualify. likewise, long-term-care\\ninsurance should be considered, typically at around age 50, because\\nit is unclear how same-sex spouses will be treated by medicaid, a\\nfederal program administered by the state, neiman said.\\n\\nsecond-parent adoption\\n\\nyour marital status does not matter here. if only one spouse is\\nthe birth parent, it is best to conduct a second-parent adoption.\\nthat will allow both parents to make decisions about the child and\\nwill ensure custody in the event that one parent dies, as well as\\nparental rights should the couple split. adoption will also give\\nthe child access to health insurance and social security disability\\nor survivor benefits from either parent.\\n\\nif you live in a state where you cannot get a second-parent\\nadoption, your next-best option is to create a co-parenting, shared\\ncustody or guardianship agreement, according to lambda legal.\\n\\ngifts\\n\\nsame-sex spouses are subject to federal gift taxes for items\\nthat add up to more than $12,000 annually. but partners, married or\\nnot, can directly pay for medical or education expenses for one\\nanother without consequences. rick kraft, a boston estate-planning\\nlawyer who works with same-sex couples, recommends a joint account,\\nas long as it is used for regular household expenses and not\\nextravagant gifts. technically, if one partner makes a big deposit\\nin a shared account and the other makes a big withdrawal, it is a\\ntaxable gift. \"it\\'s a sticky area, and there is no definitive\\nguidance out there about how to apply this in the day-to-day\\noperation of a household,\" he said.\\n\\ngiven the tangle of terminology and rights, it is best to sit\\ndown with a financial planner, and perhaps an estate planning\\nlawyer, to work through your individual situation. unless the\\nfederal government recognizes same-sex marriage, the complexities\\nwill continue. \"it\\'s like seeing someone out in the water drowning\\nand saying, \\'i will give them a lifesaver, but i won\\'t let them on\\nthe boat,\"\\' said p. louise halloran, a vice president in wealth\\nmanagement at smith barney in connecticut, who has several same-sex\\ncouples as clients.\\n\\ndavid pratt, a transfer student to american\\nuniversity here, was ready to settle for almost anything after a\\nmonth-long housing search. so, when he visited a row house in the\\ngeorgetown neighborhood, he overlooked the peeling paint, the\\nsplintered floorboards, the shattered windows and the washing\\nmachine that drained onto the floor.\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t notice all those things,\" pratt said. \"i was just\\nhappy to have found the place.\"\\n\\nin august, when pratt and his housemates moved in, the previous\\ntenants were gone, and the 140-year-old house\\'s problems were\\nglaring. disenchanted, pratt, 22, began looking for help.\\n\\na quick internet search found thisshouldbeillegal.com, a web\\nsite set up in august by city housing officials as part of a\\ncampaign for students and others looking to rent legal and safe\\nhousing.\\n\\nthe city set up accounts on free web sites, including facebook,\\ntwitter and wordpress, with links to housing codes, an inspection\\nchecklist used by the city, and a searchable database of landlords\\'\\nbusiness licenses. renters can also use the sites anonymously to\\nreport violations or to request inspections.\\n\\n\"too often, students are the target of off-campus landlords\\ntrying to make a quick buck at your expense,\" linda argo, the\\ndirector of the program, said in a videotaped introduction to the\\nweb site. \"so we want to put the power in your hands.\"\\n\\nmore than 9,000 users have visited, and a third of them have\\nused the database, said michael rupert, the city official who works\\nwith the student housing campaign.\\n\\nrupert, who lists his cell phone number and e-mail address on\\nthe web site, said he had taken more than 200 inspection requests\\nfrom students, at least 50 of which led to investigations.\\n\\nmany students are unaware of their rights as renters. relying on\\nfirst impressions of housing or descriptions from online listings,\\nthey can be easy prey for unscrupulous landlords.\\n\\nargo said the city wanted a new tool to ease students\\' concerns\\nabout retaliation and even eviction for reporting illegal rentals\\nor unsafe properties. officials said the program could help deal\\nwith problems like those that led to the 2004 death of daniel\\nrigby, a 21-year-old georgetown university senior.\\n\\nrigby died of smoke inhalation, trapped inside his burning\\nbasement apartment blocks from campus. investigators said metal\\nbars welded over windows and a furnace blocking a rear exit\\nprevented him from escaping the fire, which they said was ignited\\nby a candle or cigarette.\\n\\ncampus firewatch, an online publication that tracks student fire\\nfatalities through news reports, said that 108 of 129\\ncampus-related fire deaths since 2000 occurred in off-campus\\nhousing.\\n\\nafter rigby\\'s death, fire officials said students turned them\\naway as they went door-to-door inspecting houses and installing\\nsmoke detectors.\\n\\n\"the traditional methods of outreach were not reaching enough\\nstudents because there was too much hesitation about contacting\\ngovernment,\" argo said. \"there were too many unknowns.\"\\n\\nacross the country, colleges and universities have tried with\\nvarying degrees of success to mediate landlord-tenant\\nrelationships. many provide rental listings, inform students of\\ntheir rights as renters and refer students to the proper\\nauthorities to settle housing disputes. few colleges provide legal\\nrepresentation for students who have problems with off-campus\\nhousing, although several give legal advice.\\n\\n\"a lot of people listen, but a lot of people don\\'t,\" said\\nesther pratt, coordinator of the university of illinois student\\ntenant union, which spends more than $20,000 a year to advertise\\nits services on campus.\\n\\nsince rigby\\'s death, georgetown university officials have\\norganized an annual safety day featuring housing authorities and\\nthe fire department. julie battaile, a university spokeswoman, said\\nthe university welcomed the city\\'s new approach.\\n\\n\"the biggest thing is that students didn\\'t know there was such\\na thing as a housing inspection that they could get,\" battaile\\nsaid. \"they want to know that kind of information.\"\\n\\nwhen pratt, the american university senior, and his roommates\\ngot no response to their complaints from the property manager, a\\nprivate company called the student housing association, pratt\\ncalled rupert.\\n\\nwithin two days, an inspector checked the house, and a week\\nlater, the landlord was cited for 17 violations. the city also\\nopened investigations of the owner of the house, lewis d. brown,\\nwho did not have a license to rent the property, and the property\\nmanagement company.\\n\\nbrown, the student housing association and its parent company,\\nmetropolitan housing, did not respond to repeated calls for\\ncomment.\\n\\npratt said that a month after he contacted the city, the\\nproperty manager had completed several repairs, including the\\nwindows and washing machine, and was working on others.\\n\\n\"i\\'m looking forward to settling this,\" he said.\\n\\nsome newspaper editors are wringing their hands over garry\\ntrudeau\\'s decision to pen several doonesbury strips for next week\\ndepicting barack obama as the winner of the election.\\n\\nbut for the politically pugnacious cartoonist, banking on an\\nobama win a week in advance had zero downside.\\n\\n\"i never considered not writing about the election, but to\\navoid lameness, i had to predicate it on an outcome,\" trudeau\\nwrote in an e-mail to the st. petersburg times.\\n\\n\"if obama wins, i\\'m in the flow and commenting on a genuine\\nphenomenon. if i\\'m wrong, there\\'ll be such a global uproar that a\\ngoofy call in a comic strip isn\\'t going to be much noticed.\"\\n\\nbut trudeau may be overly modest. already, the chicago tribune\\nhas decided to take the nov. 5 strip off its regular comics pages,\\nwhich will be printed before the election results are known .\\n\\nsome newspapers worry that if sen. john mccain wins, they\\'ll be\\nstuck with at least four strips that read like an ongoing \"dewey\\ndefeats truman\" headline  touting a victory that didn\\'t happen and\\nticking off some readers.\\n\\n\"if obama is elected president in (doonesbury\\'s) world,\" said\\ntim bannon, editor of the chicago tribune\\'s daily features section,\\n\"will he stay president for the next four years?\"\\n\\npossibly, according to trudeau, who said it would be a \"great\\nidea\" to keep obama president in doonesbury even if he loses.\\n\\nat the st. petersburg times, features editor mike wilson said\\nthe newspaper will run trudeau\\'s strips as he wrote them.\\n\\n\"if he\\'s right, the people who like him still like him, and the\\npeople who hate him still hate him,\" wilson wrote in an e-mail.\\n\"if he\\'s wrong, everybody gets

money market fund company whose shareholders have\\nwaited more than six weeks for their money. but it has become\\nharder for the fund company\\'s regulators.\\n\\nafter freezing withdrawals from most of its money funds in the\\nwake of a panicky run on sept. 15, the reserve fund mailed out\\nchecks on friday to shareholders of its giant primary fund,\\nreturning half their original stake and promising substantial\\nfuture payments as more portfolio assets are sold.\\n\\nbefore the fund can send out the last of those future checks,\\nhowever, its regulators at the securities and exchange commission\\nhave to choose sides in a backstage battle between two groups of\\nprimary fund investors -- one of which includes an investment arm of\\nthe chinese government.\\n\\nthat choice will determine how big those final checks will be\\nand how big a loss shareholders will ultimately incur, at least\\nuntil the courts work through the growing docket of lawsuits facing\\nthe fund and its managers.\\n\\non one side of the sec fight are the lawyers for shareholders\\nwho submitted redemption orders after the fund \"broke the buck\"\\non sept. 16, reporting a per-share value below a dollar -- 97 cents,\\nto be exact. that team is urging that all shareholders who\\nsubmitted redemption orders anytime during or after the week of\\nsept. 15 share equally in the liquidation proceeds.\\n\\nthe other legal team represents investors who applied to\\nwithdraw their money on monday, sept. 15, when the fund was still\\nposting a price of a dollar a share, but who did not actually get\\npaid before redemptions were suspended.\\n\\namong those \"monday shareholders\" is the stable investment\\ncorp., a subsidiary of the state-sponsored china investment corp.,\\nwhich has more than $5 billion frozen in the fund.\\n\\nthe corporation \"has communicated with the sec through our\\nlegal counsel, highlighting the fund\\'s promise of full repayment,\"\\nit said in a recent statement. \"we reiterated our points to the\\nsec with regards to the full recovery of cic\\'s investment.\"\\n\\nlawyers for the opposing side say they are concerned about the\\npolitical pressure that china, one of the nation\\'s major creditors\\nand trading partners, is putting on the commission -- although the\\nlarge institutional clients they represent are generally not shy\\nabout \"reiterating\" their points to regulators either.\\n\\n\"generally, we do not comment on whether or not we\\'ve been\\ncontacted by outside parties,\" said john heine, a spokesman for\\nthe sec, on friday. nor would he indicate when the commission would\\nmake its decision, although lawyers on both sides said a decision\\ncould come as early as next week.\\n\\nsome reserve fund

back to palm beach county and the\\nbitter memory of butterfly ballots and hanging chads that helped\\ndoom his presidential bid in 2000.\\n\\n\"sooooo, where were we? it\\'s been a long eight years,\" gore\\ntold a crowd at a convention center about a mile from the former\\nelections office where the confusing ballot was conceived.\\n\\nhis wife, tipper, at his side and a barack obama banner\\nstretched across the stage, gore engaged in a subtle game of\\nwhat-if: what if he had won and not george w. bush?\\n\\n\"the economy started going downhill when the policies were\\nchanged and it started on jan. 20, 2001. i know, i was the first\\none laid off,\" he said. \"but seriously, right now we are in the\\nfinal days of this historic election. don\\'t let anyone take your\\nvote away from you or talk you into throwing it away.\\n\\n\"take it from me, elections matter. every vote matters.\"\\n\\nthe former vice president was making his first appearance for\\nobama in florida, with stops in west palm beach and pompano beach.\\nbefore modest but enthusiastic crowds, he issued an urgent plea for\\nvoters to head to the polls before tuesday. the crowd paid homage\\nin

charlie crist\\'s \"leadership and\\nstatesmanship\" for issuing an executive order adding four more\\nhours a day to early voting. he denounced sen. john mccain as a\\nbush clone, telling an afternoon audience in broward county that\\nmccain has overwhelmingly supported the president\\'s policies.\\n\\nbut as much as gore dutifully played the role of surrogate, the\\nstain of 2000 permeated the day.\\n\\n\"we know it was the curse of the butterfly ballot that brought\\nthe chaos to the world. it started here and it must end here,\"\\nwest palm beach mayor louis frankel said before gore took the\\nstage.\\n\\nthe ballot was confusing to many palm beach county voters\\nbecause it listed the names of presidential candidates on opposing\\npages, apparently leading many in the heavily democratic county to\\nmistakenly select right-wing, third-party candidate pat buchanan\\ninstead of gore.\\n\\nit was one of a string of mishaps that transfixed the country\\nindeed, the

emirate\\'s front man.\\nsulaiman al-fahim, a property developer who managed the purchase\\nfor the family, vowed to lure soccer\\'s biggest stars and win a\\neuropean championship, and socialized with pamela anderson and demi\\nmoore.\\n\\nbut when it came time to appoint a chairman to run the team\\'s\\nbusiness side, the flashy fahim was replaced by one of the royal\\nfamily\\'s most trusted advisers, khaldoon al-mubarak, the\\n32-year-old director of abu dhabi\\'s high-profile development fund,\\nmubadala.\\n\\nwith his designer stubble and perfectly tailored suit, mubarak\\ncut a figure of suave aplomb as he watched his new team from the\\nstands. later, he issued a soothing statement about developing the\\nyounger players and the 10-year plan for the club, then he\\ndiscreetly returned to abu dhabi, which is part of the united arab\\nemirates.\\n\\nthe message from the sheiks: no need for bluster and starlets;\\nabu dhabi\\'s money -- all 200 million pounds, or $330 million, of it\\n-- speaks for itself.\\n\\nit spoke again on friday, as sheikh mansour, who is also\\nchairman of the international petroleum investment co., invested\\nalmost 3.5 billion pounds ($5.77 billion) in barclays, one of\\nbritain\\'s largest banks -- for a stake that could reach 16 percent\\nof the bank.\\n\\nqatari investors will hold up to another 15.5 percent.\\n\\nwith markets in turmoil and some big sovereign wealth funds\\nlosing billions on western bets, one of the questions hanging over\\nthe new world economic disorder has been whether sovereign wealth\\nand other state funds will continue to slosh around the world. the\\nnew barclay\\'s investment offered a resounding yes.\\n\\n\"we are not going to be running away when the market is down,\"\\nmubarak said in a brief interview last month. \"there are a lot of\\ninteresting opportunities out there.\"\\n\\nthere are also calls for greater regulation of state-run funds,\\nfears of a global recession and oil\\'s fall from $145.29 a barrel to\\njust $67.81 on friday. but abu dhabi sits atop about 9 percent of\\nthe world\\'s oil reserves and still has the cash to spare.\\n\\nunlike its larger-than-life neighbor dubai, it has been until\\nrecently hyperdiscreet about how it deploys its windfall. but now\\nthat it is emerging from the shadows, it is looking for attention --\\nbut not the kind of flash-and-dash that dubai is known for.\\n\\nand mubarak is the perfect avatar. he had a meteoric ascent from\\na sales executive for abu dhabi\\'s oil company to a powerful seat on\\nabu dhabi\\'s governing executive council and oversight of mubadala,\\nthe emirate\\'s aggressive development fund, which has recently made\\nseveral highly visible strategic investments.\\n\\nthese have included stakes in the private equity fund carlyle,\\nthe american computer chip maker advanced micro devices and more\\nrecently general electric.\\n\\nthe emirate\\'s sovereign fund, the abu dhabi investment\\nauthority, is recognized as the world\\'s largest. it has an\\nestimated $600 billion, compared with mubadala\\'s more than $10\\nbillion, and operates behind a thick veil of secrecy. the\\nauthority\\'s mandate is to invest abu dhabi\\'s oil surplus abroad as\\na hands-off portfolio investor; mubadala\\'s charge is to invest in\\njoint ventures that promise both a commercial and a strategic\\npayback for the emirate.\\n\\n\"mubarak has become abu dhabi\\'s interface with the rest of the\\nworld,\" said christopher davidson, a professor at durham\\nuniversity in britain, who has written an economic history of abu\\ndhabi. \"he has the ear of the crown prince and he can step in\\nwhenever he is needed.\"\\n\\nmubarak appeared this summer on cnbc with ge\\'s chief executive,\\njeffrey r. immelt, to promote an $8 billion joint venture focused\\non commercial finance in the middle east and africa, and he openly\\nsignaled mubadala\\'s plan to become one of ge\\'s 10 largest\\nshareholders.\\n\\nby july, mubadala is expected to have completed its planned\\naccumulation of ge stock, a financial commitment that could surpass\\n$3 billion.\\n\\nto a large extent, mubadala\\'s increasingly public profile\\ntracked the rise in the price of oil to a peak of $145.29 a barrel\\nthis summer. falling oil surpluses will most likely create a rising\\nneed for money to support local economies and markets. the federal\\ngovernment of the united arab emirates has already disbursed more\\nthan $30 billion to support local banks.\\n\\nbut waleed al-mokarrab, the chief operating officer for\\nmubadala, points out that last year the average price of oil was\\n$80. \"we do not expect a massive change for next year,\" he said,\\nsuggesting the deals will keep coming.\\n\\nso far, mubadala has invested in sectors like aerospace, health\\ncare, gas and aluminum production, water purification, computer\\nchips and, with ge, commercial finance.\\n\\n\"we are literally a development company,\" said mokarrab. like\\nmubarak, he was educated in the united states and has a fondness\\nfor american-style business school jargon.\\n\\nto wit, they call the abu dhabi government their shareholder,\\nrefer to investments as \"game changers\" and speak fluently of\\ninternal rates of return.\\n\\n\"we take money from our shareholder and we create businesses on\\nthe ground,\" mokarrab added. \"we are building a country\\ntogether.\"\\n\\nunlike the investment authority, mubadala uses debt to help\\nfinance some projects -- crucially, with the guarantee of abu\\ndhabi\\'s cash reserves. the portfolio is financed on a ratio of 60\\npercent equity to 40 percent debt.\\n\\nwhile mubarak\\'s smooth western ways and his acumen have\\nimpressed investors, his close relationship with the crown prince,\\nthe younger half-brother of abu dhabi\\'s ruler and his expected\\nsuccessor, is behind mubarak\\'s increasing prominence. he heads an\\nelite advisory group called the executive affairs authority that\\nadvises the crown prince, who is considered the leading voice for\\ncautiously modernizing the emirate, on a range of economic,\\nfinancial, social and communications issues. compared with to its\\ntwo flanking neighbors, saudi arabia and iran, abu dhabi has made\\nbold strides, yet its disposition remains secretive and its outlook\\ncautious, a reflection of the conservative spirit of its ruler,\\nsheik khalifa bin zayed al-nahyan.\\n\\nall of which makes mubarak all the more crucial. \"if you have\\nhis leadership skills and you can speak for the crown prince and\\nyou have money, that is a very effective combination,\" said david\\nrubenstein, a co-founder of the carlyle group.\\n\\nstill, with oil prices continuing to fall and the persian gulf\\'s\\nown economies showing strains, many analysts expect the busy\\ndeal-making of the last year to slow -- somewhat.\\n\\neven with oil around $60 a barrel, abu dhabi clears a healthy\\nsurplus and the emirate is likely to move cautiously but\\npurposefully toward a more active role in the international\\nfinancial community, with mubarak and mubadala front and center.\\n\\n\"he has a lot of bandwidth for his age,\" said immelt, ge\\'s\\nchief, who calls mubarak a friend. \"he is a great public face for\\nabu dhabi as well as being one of the great young

her court ruling on friday, justice eileen c. bransten of the\\nstate supreme court ruled that the banks were entitled to their\\noriginal contract.\\n\\nfriday\\'s decision is the latest blow to hexion, which was found\\nby a delaware court judge to have intentionally breached its\\nagreement with huntsman.\\n\\nin its delaware lawsuit, the company argued that forcing the\\ndeal\\'s

districts and 3 million students.\\n\\nmills, 63, said in an interview on friday that he had decided it\\nwas time for a change after leading the education department\\nthrough a critical period that has brought higher standards for\\nacademic achievement and, for the first time, has held school\\ndistricts accountable for student performance on standardized\\ntests.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t want to get to a point where i\\'m tired and out of\\nideas and then say \\'i\\'m leaving,\"\\' he said. \"i want to leave at\\nthe top of my game and help the board of regents up until the\\nend.\"\\n\\nmills, who is paid $195,000 a year, was appointed in 1995 by the\\nboard of regents, whose 16 members are selected by the state\\nlegislature for five-year terms. mills was previously the education\\ncommissioner of vermont for seven years. robert m. bennett, the\\nchancellor of the board of regents, said that a national search\\nwould be held this winter to find mills\\' successor.\\n\\nunder mills\\' tenure, the state has raised high school graduation\\nrates while making college preparatory courses known as regents\\ncourses a requirement, and making the regents diploma, which is\\ngranted to students who pass regents exams in core subjects, the\\nstandard for all students. in addition, the number of credits\\nrequired for graduation rose to 22.5 from 20.5.\\n\\n\"his goal was that every district would have a 100 percent\\ngraduation rate, and i think, by and large, you see improvements\\nacross the board,\" said henry l. grishman, superintendent of the\\njericho district on long island and former president of the new\\nyork state council of school superintendents. jericho\\'s graduation\\nrate has averaged between 98 percent and 100 percent in each of the\\nlast three years, up from about 85 percent in the mid-1990s.\\n\\nwith the regents\\' backing, mills in 1999 began holding districts\\naccountable for student performance on state achievement tests, a\\npractice that later became mandatory under the 2001 federal law\\ncalled no child left behind. the state also established a system of\\nstate report cards to help parents and community members evaluate\\ntheir local schools.\\n\\nin particular, mills and state education officials made it a\\npriority to close the achievement gap for poor and minority\\nstudents by advocating for more financial resources for districts\\nwith large numbers of poor and disadvantaged students, and by\\neventually developing a new school aid formula that allocated more\\nmoney for high-needs districts, including new york city\\'s.\\n\\n\"what we\\'ve learned is that the direction set by a state leader\\nmatters a lot in terms of whether kids learn or don\\'t,\" said kati\\nhaycock, president of the education trust, an advocacy group based\\nin washington. \"if you judge this man by the improvement in\\nachievement, especially among minority and poor students, you would\\nhave to say that he helped bring about some of the biggest gains in\\nthe country.\"\\n\\nbut some educators and parents have said that mills placed too\\nmuch emphasis on standardized testing -- with the result that many\\nschools focused on drilling students on basic skills in english and\\nmath that were covered on tests at the expense of more creative\\nforms of instruction in poetry and writing as well as in enrichment\\nactivities like art, music and even field trips.\\n\\nmills has also been criticized for his oversight of the\\n2,800-student roosevelt school district on long island, which\\nstruggled with financial problems and weak student performance for\\nyears after it was taken over by the education department in 2002.\\nin january, the state legislature approved an $8 million bailout\\nfor the district to settle an accumulated debt that had threatened\\nto cripple its daily operations.\\n\\nmills said he wished that he had known about roosevelt\\'s recent\\nfinancial problems sooner, but moved quickly to address them once\\nhe did. he pointed out that the state had built new buildings in\\nthe district and sent in some of the state\\'s top administrators to\\noversee improvements.\\n\\nhe said that while standardized testing was necessary as a way\\nto gauge student achievement fairly and consistently, he had also\\nemphasized the need for art and music and other creative pursuits.\\n\\nmills got his start in education as a history teacher at the\\ndalton school on the upper east side of manhattan from 1967 to\\n1971, after earning bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degrees in history from\\nmiddlebury college and columbia university. he subsequently helped\\nestablish and run the elizabeth seeger school, an alternative\\npublic high school, on west 12th street.\\n\\nmills said that he planned to continue working in the education\\nfield and would be considering his options after stepping down as\\ncommissioner.\\n\\n\"it will be hard to leave in june, but there\\'s time to get a\\nlot of work done between now and then,\" he said. \"this experience\\nhas been exhilarating -- even the hardest day has had a clear\\npurpose.

parent of columbia pictures,\\nis in advanced negotiations toward a deal to co-finance the films\\nwith paramount, its hollywood-based rival. the talks were described\\nby people who were briefed on them, and who spoke on condition of\\nanonymity to avoid conflict among the parties.\\n\\nkathleen kennedy, a producer of spielberg\\'s project, did not\\nrespond to a query. peter nelson, a lawyer for jackson, declined to\\ncomment, as did a sony pictures spokesman, steve elzer. a\\nspokeswoman for paramount also declined to comment.\\n\\nthe negotiations began after universal pictures backed away last\\nmonth from an arrangement under which it would have shared the\\nproject, based on the long-running belgian comic strip about a\\nglobetrotting young reporter, with paramount.\\n\\nspielberg has been eager to begin shooting the first movie as\\nearly as this year. using motion-capture technology that combines\\nlive actors with computer animation, he has already filmed parts of\\nthe picture. but universal, which had an option to become involved\\nbecause spielberg started the project there 25 years ago, shocked\\nmany in hollywood by declaring it too risky, despite the\\nparticipation of spielberg, who has kept his offices on universal\\'s\\nlot for decades.\\n\\nthe first film\\'s budget of about $130 million is not\\nexceptionally large by contemporary standards. but spielberg and\\njackson, as two of the industry\\'s most prestigious directors, were\\ndemanding nearly a third of the movie\\'s gross receipts -- terms that\\nproved difficult at a time when studios were tightening belts.\\n\\nparamount later offered to make the movie on terms it found more\\nfavorable, but the directors\\' representatives pressed for\\nalternatives. sony offered to take the movie under a deal more to\\nthe filmmakers\\' liking, but paramount was reluctant to let go\\nentirely and began discussing a partnership, according to one of\\nthe people briefed on the discussions.\\n\\nunder the deal now being discussed, paramount would distribute\\nthe \"tintin\" movies in north america and some english-speaking\\nterritories, while sony would distribute the pictures in various\\nforeign territories, including europe and latin america, according\\nto a person briefed on the talks. in recent years, studios have\\nroutinely split some of their more expensive movies, usually by\\nleaving one studio with foreign distribution rights, and another\\nwith domestic.\\n\\nthus, \"the curious case of benjamin button,\" a coming film\\ndirected by david fincher and starring brad pitt, will be\\ndistributed by paramount in the united states and by warner\\nbrothers abroad.\\n\\nfor sony, a deal would be the first time spielberg has worked\\nwith the studio as a director since 1991, when he made \"hook\" for\\nthe company\\'s tristar pictures unit. in 1977, spielberg made\\n\"close encounters of the third kind,\" one of his biggest hits,\\nfor columbia, long before the studio was acquired by sony.\\n\\nthe first \"tintin\" movie is expected to be ready for release\\nin 2010. jackson\\'s installment would come some time after, but does\\nnot yet have a completed script.\\n\\nfor paramount, a deal would be one more step in the readjustment\\nof its relations with spielberg and his new dreamworks company. the\\nstudio had acquired dreamworks in 2006, but spielberg and his\\nassociates left to form a new venture under the same name last\\nmonth.\\n\\nspielberg is expected to remain involved with a number of\\nparamount projects in coming months. he has a producing role, for\\ninstance, on \"transformers: revenge of the fallen,\" a sequel set\\nfor release in june.\\n\\nmeanwhile, his new company remains entangled with

door-to-door, often to women who lived far from big\\ndepartment stores.\\n\\nthis american frontier model has translated well to countries\\nlike brazil and china, where large populations are dispersed across\\na vast countryside. today, more than two-thirds of avon\\'s sales are\\noutside the united states.\\n\\nthe direct-selling model -- where independent sales\\nrepresentatives do not work directly for avon -- makes it easier to\\nbreak into new markets, says avon\\'s chairwoman and chief executive,\\nandrea jung. about 5.5 million sales representatives now sell avon\\nproducts, be it lip gloss in shanghai, china, or face powder in rio\\nde janeiro, brazil.\\n\\nthe company, reporting its third-quarter earnings thursday, said\\nthe only region where sales fell was north america, which it\\ndefines as the united states, canada and puerto rico. by contrast,\\nrevenue rose 25 percent in both latin america and china and 8\\npercent in western europe, the middle east and africa.\\n\\njung, who was born the daughter of chinese immigrants in toronto\\nand moved to a suburb of boston when she was 10, recently discussed\\nhow she thinks the company\\'s direct-selling model can improve the\\nlives of women in developing countries and where the next big\\ngrowth opportunities are for avon.\\n\\nq: since you became the chief of avon in 1999, the company has\\nexpanded into emerging markets. why do you think your\\ndirect-selling model works so well in developing countries?\\n\\njung: it is part of a movement around the world for women to\\nhave more economic independence. from her very first order, a\\nrepresentative does not have to pull the money out of her pocket.\\nwe send her the products, and she pays us after she sells them. the\\ndirect-selling model does not have to be centered around where\\nthere is heavy retail infrastructure, either. for example, china is\\ngoing to be one of avon\\'s largest market opportunities. it has a\\nlarge geographic expanse, with hundreds of thousands of women in\\nsmall villages really striving to make an earnings opportunity for\\nthemselves.\\n\\nq: and the majority of your independent sales representatives\\nare women?\\n\\njung: well over 95 percent are women and the men are often in\\navon couples. i love those conversations, where the husbands tell\\nme that they quit their jobs because their wife\\'s business was\\ndoing so well, so they\\'ve joined forces to run the business as a\\ncouple.\\n\\nq: given the fact that your sales representatives are not\\nemployed by avon, how do you establish new markets?\\n\\njung: we hire recruiting managers, who are avon employees. they\\nstart canvassing for representatives in work places, in religious\\ngatherings, in school fundraisers. we also run recruiting\\nadvertisements in a dozen markets today. and we train our\\nrepresentatives how to manage their businesses online. for example,\\nin turkey, where there is not much internet penetration, we have\\nclose to 100 percent of our sales representatives entering their\\norders online. they go to internet cafes or libraries.\\n\\nq: how do you deal with economic uncertainty in emerging\\nmarkets?\\n\\njung: with what\\'s going on the last couple of weeks, it reminds\\nme of the very difficult time we had in russia. i recall in the\\nlate \\'90s, with the massive devaluation of the ruble, our russian\\nbusiness really became quite challenged. some companies were\\nretrenching, but we looked across russia and saw 11 time zones,\\nwith women in every small town and village who wanted the\\nopportunity to be economically independent. so we were committed to\\nstaying.\\n\\nq: do you feel that your experience growing up as the daughter\\nof chinese immigrants has influenced your career?\\n\\njung: it has given me a global vantage point, being the daughter\\nof immigrants from china, who had nothing when they came here. and\\nnow i am leading a company. it speaks to something deep in me, the\\nconcept that you don\\'t have to start with anything. the\\ndirect-sales opportunity allows people to change their lives.\\n\\nq: many of your customers are familiar with the work of the avon\\nfoundation, but they might not know that you have similar programs\\nin countries like mexico and malaysia. how global is your\\nphilanthropy now?\\n\\njung: we\\'ve got programs in around 50 different countries.\\ntogether, we have raised $580 million, mostly for breast cancer\\nresearch, diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\na couple of years ago, we added a second issue: violence against\\nwomen. we have made educational pamphlets about breast self-exams\\nand about domestic violence, which our representatives can give to\\ntheir customers. we have donated mammography units to underserved\\nhospitals in spain and created mobile mammography units in china.\\n\\nrecently, i had one of those amazing experiences where life and\\nwork intersect. my maternal grandmother, who was from mainland\\nchina, died of breast cancer in singapore in the 1970s. it was\\ndiagnosed at a late stage and she just passed away. it was\\nsomething that wasn\\'t talked about back then. it was the \"c\"\\nword. about a year ago, my mother discovered that she had breast\\ncancer. she was diagnosed at an avon breast cancer center, which\\nour people worked so hard to donate to mass. general. it was\\ndetected at a very early stage, with digital mammography, and one\\nyear later she is cancer-free. when i look at the two generations\\nin my own family, it shows the progress that has been made on this\\nissue over the last 30 years.\\n\\ntampa  all agreed that the new chief at u.s. central command\\nneeds no introduction.\\n\\ngen. david petraeus, widely feted as the architect behind the\\niraq troop surge, took the helm at centcom on friday in an hourlong\\nceremony under fluttering flags off hillsborough bay.\\n\\npetraeus comes to centcom headquarters at macdill air force base\\nwith enormous political capital and the kind of military reputation\\nseldom seen in the days since world war ii.\\n\\nas the outgoing centcom commander, lt. gen. martin dempsey,\\njoked, \"you probably need less introduction than anyone i know.\"\\n\\npetraeus comes to centcom with the challenge of stemming the\\nrising violence in afghanistan.\\n\\npetraeus, 55, shook dempsey\\'s hand  the pair are from the same\\nwest point class of 1974  and offered a few quiet words as he took\\nofficial responsibility for centcom\\'s area of responsibility.\\n\\nthat responsibility is one of the largest in the u.s. military:\\nnearly two dozen countries, including oversight for the wars in\\niraq and afghanistan and other hot spots such as pakistan.\\n\\npetraeus, who has served three tours in iraq including one as\\ncommander of the 101st airborne division, is credited with policies\\nhelping curb violence in iraq.\\n\\nand expectations that he will do the same in afghanistan could\\nhardly be higher.\\n\\ndefense secretary robert gates praised petraeus and dempsey, who\\nhad been the acting centcom commander for seven months after adm.\\nwilliam fallon was forced to resign.\\n\\nspeaking of petraeus, gates said \"history will regard him as\\none of our nation\\'s great battle captains. he is the preeminent\\nsoldier, scholar, statesman of his generation. and he is precisely\\nthe man we need at this command. ... now he will take aim at our\\nadversaries in afghanistan.\"\\n\\npetraeus, who had served as the overall ground commander in iraq\\nsince early 2007, is expected to quickly travel back to centcom\\'s\\narea of responsibility in the middle east.\\n\\nthe general warned all: \"the way ahead will be difficult.\"\\n\\nnever thought i\\'d see the day when those two drama kings of the\\nhemispheres, david beckham and diego maradona, would be\\novershadowed by a second-string goalkeeper from major league\\nsoccer.\\n\\nbut that is exactly what happened recently, as one soaring free\\nkick by danny cepero, making his league debut for the red bulls,\\nbounced into the opposing goal. bend that, david and diego.\\n\\ngoals by goalkeepers happen to be one of my favorite\\nman-bites-dog events -- even more than home runs by pitchers or\\ntouchdowns by lumbering 350-pound linemen.\\n\\ni\\'ve always loved the sight of feral keepers like rene higuita\\nand jose luis chilavert and jorge campos, renaissance men from the\\namericas. now cepero, out of the university of pennsylvania, has\\nbecome an instant legend.\\n\\ncepero will be in goal saturday at 4 p.m. when the red bulls\\nopen the playoffs against houston at giants stadium. he promises no\\nsuch fireworks like the 81-yard goal he unleashed on oct. 18 -- a\\nfreakish bounce on the home artificial turf, the first keeper\\'s\\ngoal in 13 years of the league\\'s existence.\\n\\nthe goal managed to eclipse the latest buzz from the peripatetic\\nbeckham and the erratic maradona.\\n\\nbeckham arranged to take the winter semester in italy, on loan\\nfrom the los angeles galaxy to ac milan, so that he can keep sharp\\nfor possible duty with the english national team.\\n\\nmaradona\\'s odyssey is far more bizarre. bounced out of world\\nsoccer because of his drug habit, nearly dead from his appetites,\\nhe is becoming the coach of argentina -- the equivalent of the\\nunited states putting jose canseco in charge of the u.s. team for\\nnext year\\'s world baseball classic.\\n\\nhowever, beckham\\'s and maradona\\'s pursuits pale compared with\\ncepero\\'s awesome kick. cepero got his chance because two teammates,\\nincluding the resident keeper, jon conway, were each suspended for\\n10 games because of a positive drug test -- from an over-the-counter\\nsupplement they had considered safe, they said. cepero, 23, had\\nplayed two reserve games for the red bulls.\\n\\n\"he\\'s one of the more cerebral chaps on the team,\" des\\nmcaleenan, the team\\'s goalkeeper coach, said. \"he reads, he\\'s very\\nlikable, never too high, never too low.\"\\n\\nin fact, cepero is earning the last credits toward his degree at\\npenn, driving down to philadelphia each week for a course, \"the\\nend of european empire,\" which he said was about decolonization,\\nconcentrating on britain.\\n\\nhe also studies his arcane craft. mcaleenan, who has trained\\ninternational keepers like tony meola and tim howard with this\\nfranchise, has encouraged cepero to produce long goal kicks to give\\nthe offense a chance to work mischief at the far end. mcaleenan\\nnoted that cepero was not among the strongest kickers he had\\ncoached.\\n\\nsome keepers insist on taking free kicks and penalty kicks.\\nrogerio ceni of brazil has produced more than 80 goals in domestic\\ncompetition, according to fifa.com, chilavert of paraguay has\\nproduced more than 60, and higuita of colombia more than 40. (the\\nexact totals are obscured by various league matches over the\\nyears.) then there was the flamboyant campos of mexico, who not\\nonly took the occasional kick but also would take the ball upfield\\nwith his dancing feet or even play striker when the mood struck.\\n\\n\"my mother is from mexico, and she is a big fan of campos,\"\\ncepero said, adding that many latino keepers have an admirable\\nflair for the dramatic. he did score a few goals as a teenager in\\nbaldwin, n.y., playing the field, but he is hardly a free-kick\\ncandidate.\\n\\npressed into duty with two days\\' notice on oct. 18, cepero had a\\n2-1 lead in the 83rd minute. given a direct kick, he lined up the\\nball on the left side, about 25 yards upfield, motioning his\\nteammates to move forward, and he let fly. from three-quarters of\\nthe field away, he saw the ball take a high bounce over the\\ncolumbus keeper, also a backup, then he saw a flutter in the cords\\nof the net. cepero\\'s vision was so obscured that he did not see the\\nball go in, but he received a context clue when teammates rushed\\nupfield and hugged him.\\n\\n\"i expected it to happen on this field,\" mcaleenan said,\\nreferring to the artificial turf. \"that is carpet over concrete.\\nit just happened to be danny.\"\\n\\nsince that stunning moment, cepero has received messages from\\nstrangers from as far away as croatia and cyprus as well as from\\nold friends, but no endorsements and no re-creation of the kick,\\nstraight down broadway, for the letterman show. at least not yet.\\n\\nreality hit home in the next game when the red bulls lost, 5-2,\\nat chicago, mcaleenan blaming their nonexistent defense. the red\\nbulls were lucky to squeak into the playoffs when dc united\\nstumbled in its final game.\\n\\nthis has been a star-crossed franchise since its first home game\\nas the metrostars when a hapless defender (from italy\\'s top league)\\nbumbled in an own goal. now danny cepero has overshadowed david\\nbeckham and diego maradona. could this franchise\\'s dismal karma\\nfinally be changing?\\n\\ntampa  jon gruden made a certain observation about new return\\nman clifton smith on sunday at dallas.\\n\\nthe buccaneers coach noticed smith has a particularly good sense\\nof direction, knowing the best way to get up the field is going\\nnorth and south.\\n\\n\"i like that. a lot of guys go backward,\" gruden said. \"i\\'m\\nnot saying dexter (jackson) did or does. i\\'m just saying that a lot\\nof guys retreat because there\\'s no one there.\"\\n\\njackson is the guy whose job smith, an undrafted rookie, appears\\nto have taken. one of jackson\\'s flaws as the primary returner\\nduring weeks 1-7 was a tendency to cut back in an effort to gain\\nyards laterally.\\n\\nconversely, smith charged forward each time he handled a punt or\\nkickoff against the cowboys, making for an impressive pro debut\\nthat was marred slightly by a lost fumble. smith\\'s first touch was\\na 20-yard punt return, the bucs\\' longest of the season.\\n\\nthere\\'s a fearlessness about smith that makes him appealing.\\n\\n\"it\\'s a hard thing to come by to go out and find a player who\\nwill sacrifice his body to run up and catch a ball, hit a hole and\\nbe able to give the offense what it needs and keep the defense off\\nthe field,\" smith, 23, said.\\n\\nyou don\\'t have to remind gruden how rare a breed he is.\\n\\n\"when you go forward, there\\'s everybody coming at you,\" he\\nsaid. \"it\\'s not a job that everybody is after. there aren\\'t a lot\\nof guys that want to return kickoffs and punts in the national\\nfootball league.\\n\\n\"you stand down there on the sidelines, and i stand behind\\nplayers. it\\'s a bizarre scene. these guys are flying down there.\\nit\\'s not for everybody.\"\\n\\nsmith was a regular returner at fresno state and had great\\nsuccess. as a sophomore, he set an ncaa record with three punt\\nreturns for 189 yards and two touchdowns against weber state. and\\nhe attended a school that is renowned for its emphasis on special\\nteams.\\n\\n\"we led the country in blocked kicks and other special teams\\ncategories,\" he said. \"(playing special teams) taught me to be a\\nversatile player.\\n\\n\"i can run down on a kickoff and know what i\\'m doing. i can\\ncome off the edge and be a punt rusher and block punts. it helped a\\nlot.\"\\n\\nhow did the experience translate to the nfl? smith said he\\nbelieves he made an impression in dallas, and it\\'s hard to argue.\\nhe was unspectacular on kickoffs, averaging 20.7 yards on three\\nreturns. but on punts, he was a significant upgrade, averaging 16.4\\nyards to jackson\\'s 4.9.\\n\\nbut smith worries what he will be remembered for more: his\\ndecisive running or his fumble of the second-half kickoff that\\ndallas recovered.\\n\\n\"i felt like i opened some eyes,\" he said. \"but then again,\\ni\\'ll have that question mark over my head like, \\'well, he might be\\na fumbler,\\' which is a stigma i don\\'t want on me at all. it\\'s not\\nmy game to put the ball on the ground.\"\\n\\nthe good news for him is he likely will get another shot sunday\\nin kansas city. after spending seven weeks on the practice squad,\\nsmith has learned to wait his turn.\\n\\n\"it\\'s always tough to be patient,\" he said. \"but that\\'s the\\nname of the game. they always say it\\'s a long season and something\\nis bound to happen.  and before you know it, it\\'ll be on you to go\\nout there and take advantage of your opportunities.\"\\n\\nsure enough, smith\\'s time is now.\\n\\nstephen f. holder can be reached at sholdersptimes.com.\\n\\ncincinnati  usf\\'s matt grothe said monday that nippert stadium\\nwas his

sunday at kansas city.\\n\\ndunn, who played sparingly sunday against the cowboys, has a\\npinched nerve in his back and did not practice this week. it\\'s\\nlikely he will be held out against the

said. \"they\\'ve yielded some big plays, and a lot of the big\\nplays they\\'ve given up have been at the end of games where they\\'re\\nfrantically trying to get the ball back. they played

many people likely snickered at the possibility that san\\nfrancisco might take its place alongside such prostitute-friendly\\nhavens as amsterdam and a few rural counties in nearby nevada.\\n\\nbut this week, it became readily apparent that city officials\\nare not laughing anymore about the measure, which would effectively\\ndecriminalize the world\\'s oldest profession in san francisco. at a\\nnews conference on wednesday, mayor gavin newsom and other\\nopponents seemed genuinely worried that proposition k might pass.\\n\\n\"this is not cute. this is not fanciful,\" newsom said,\\nstanding in front of the pink-on-pink facade of a closed massage\\nparlor in the tenderloin district. \"this is a big mistake.\"\\n\\nsupporters of the measure say it is a long-overdue correction of\\na criminal approach toward prostitutes, which neither rehabilitates\\nnor helps them, and often ignores their complaints of abuse.\\n\\n\"basically, if you feel that you\\'re a criminal, it can be used\\nagainst you,\" said carol leigh, who says she has worked as a\\nprostitute for 35 years and now works as an advocate for those who\\ntrade sex for money. \"it\\'s a really serious situation, and ending\\nthis criminalization is the only solution i see to protect these\\nother women working now.\"\\n\\nthe language in proposition k is far-reaching. it would forbid\\nthe city police from using any resources to investigate or\\nprosecute people who engage in prostitution. it would also bar\\nfinancing for a \"first offender\" program for prostitutes and\\ntheir clients or for mandatory \"re-education programs.\"\\n\\none of the measure\\'s broadest prohibitions would prevent the\\ncity from applying for federal or state grants that use \"racial\\nprofiling\" in anti-prostitution efforts, an apparent reference to\\nraids seeking illegal immigrants.\\n\\nthe fight over the ballot initiative has become an awkward test\\nof san francisco\\'s dual attitudes of live-and-let-live and\\nsave-the-world. in the campaign\\'s closing days, the rhetoric on\\nboth sides has heated up. supporters of the measure accuse the city\\nof profiting from prostitution through fines. they also imply that\\nlaws against prostitution are inherently racist because minorities\\nare disproportionately arrested.\\n\\nproposition k, they say, will increase safety for women, save\\ntaxpayer money and cut down on the number of murders of prostitutes\\nat the hands of serial killers.\\n\\nbut opponents dismiss the notion of legions of prostitutes\\nhappily romping through the city\\'s neighborhoods. \"this isn\\'t\\n\\'pretty woman,\"\\' was how one put it.\\n\\nanti-proposition k forces paint grim pictures of girls and women\\nfrom across the country held against their will in dark and\\ndangerous brothels here, forced into unsafe sexual behavior, and\\noften beaten, intimidated and raped.\\n\\n\"you\\'re going to have young girls recruited and brought to san\\nfrancisco, and they are going to be standing on these corners,\"\\nsaid norma hotaling, the founder and director of standing against\\nglobal exploitation, an outreach project here. \"and there\\'s not\\ngoing to be any services for them to go to, and the police are not\\ngoing to have any means of investigating the cases.\"\\n\\nthe measure seems particularly abhorrent to san francisco\\'s\\ndistrict attorney, kamala d. harris, who has made fighting human\\ntrafficking a priority.\\n\\n\"i think it\\'s completely ridiculous, just in case there\\'s any\\nambiguity about my position,\" harris said. \"it would put a\\nwelcome mat out for pimps and prostitutes to come on into san\\nfrancisco.\"\\n\\ncentral to harris\\' objections is the theory that prostitution is\\na victimless crime. instead, she said, it exposes prostitutes to\\ndrug, gun and sexual crimes, and \"compromises the quality of life\\nin a community.\"\\n\\nshe also dismisses the argument that prostitutes would be more\\nlikely to come forward if their business were not illegal.\\n\\n\"we\\'re in the practice and habit of protecting victims, not\\ncriminalizing victims,\" harris said, adding that she often reminds\\njuries that the law protects people even if they are prostitutes or\\ndrug users. \"our penal code was not created just to protect snow\\nwhite,\" she said, noting that 65 percent of cases handled by her\\ndepartment\\'s sexual assault unit involved sex workers as victims.\\n\\nofficials with the state attorney general\\'s office would not\\ncomment on the measure.\\n\\nthe city\\'s board of supervisors, several of whom have expressed\\nsupport for the measure in the past, would have the power to amend\\nproposition k if it passed. san francisco, which has an exotic\\ndancers union and a well-established history of sexual freedom, is\\nnot the first liberal outpost to mull legalizing prostitution. a\\ndecriminalization bill was defeated by voters in berkeley, calif.,\\nin 2004.\\n\\nheidi machen, a spokeswoman for the opposition, said her side\\nwas hoping for a solid defeat. \"we want this to fail by a\\nlandslide,\" she said. \"so it doesn\\'t come back.\"\\n\\na local cbs poll released thursday found that 35 percent of\\nlikely voters supported the measure, while 39 percent were opposed.\\nbut 26 percent were still undecided.\\n\\non thursday night, about 50 supporters of the measure gathered\\nat a church to press their case. one of them, patricia west, 22,\\nsaid she has been working for about a year as an \"independent,\\nin-call escort.\"\\n\\nwest said that she enjoyed her work and believed that\\nproposition k would allow prostitutes to organize into collectives\\nand negotiate for safer working conditions and better wages.\\n\\nwest concedes that what she does for a living \"can be\\ndangerous.\" but she hoped proposition k would make her occupation\\nsafer and more legitimate. \"working in a coal mine can be really\\ndangerous, too,\" she said, \"but it pays a lot of money so you\\'re\\ncompensated for your risk.\"\\n\\nlightning coach barry melrose knows exactly how the media game\\nis played.\\n\\ntwelve years as an analyst for espn provides such insight.\\n\\nso, when reporters took shots at his team for its stumbling\\nstart, melrose reminded it was early. when columnists speculated\\nhis job already is in jeopardy (sports illustrated incorrectly\\npredicted he would be the first coach fired), he shrugged.\\n\\n\"that\\'s their job,\" melrose said. \"i know all those guys.\\nwhen we win a couple, i\\'ll be the greatest coach in the world, so i\\ndon\\'t worry about stuff like that. if you worry about stuff like\\nthat, you shouldn\\'t be in the business.\"\\n\\nit is difficult to imagine a coach with a shorter honeymoon.\\n\\nchicago\\'s denis savard was canned after four games, but that was\\nthe final act of a scripted drama. melrose is a new hire in a\\nsituation that screams for patience: 15 new players learning a new\\nsystem while their coach, out of the game since he was fired by the\\nkings in april 1995, tries to re-establish his credibility and that\\nof a team that last season was the league\\'s worst.\\n\\nbut given the money owners oren koules and len barrie have put\\ninto the roster, even melrose said, \"i don\\'t think we have a year.\\n\\ni\\'m under no illusion i have a five-year plan.\"\\n\\nif there is a timetable, general manager brian lawton isn\\'t\\nsaying. \"we\\'re still in the earliest stages of evaluation,\" he\\nsaid of a process he stressed is focused on the entire team.\\n\\n\"we expect a lot from our players. we expect a lot from our\\ncoaches, so thus, my comments would be we still have a lot of work\\nto do. we\\'re not where we want to be or expect to be.\"\\n\\nbut heading into tonight\\'s game with the senators at the st.\\npete times forum, things are better. tampa bay (3-3-3) has won two\\nstraight, and three of four, and thursday dominated the\\nthen-northeast-leading sabres 5-2 in buffalo.\\n\\n\"the guys better know their roles now and understand what it\\'s\\ngoing to take for us to be a good team, and a lot of that has to do\\nwith him,\" left wing mark recchi said of melrose. \"has everyone\\ndone the right things? no. we haven\\'t as players. but he cares.\\nhe\\'s passionate about it and wants us to do the right things.\"\\n\\nrecchi said that melrose had instant credibility with the\\nplayers \"because he is a hockey person and we know he\\'s a good\\ncoach, so he had respect coming in.\"\\n\\nmelrose, 52, said the only way for him to earn self-respect was\\nto get behind the bench.\\n\\n\"if i wouldn\\'t have taken the job, i would have been a\\nhypocrite,\" melrose said. \"i\\'m sitting up there (at espn) and\\ncriticizing other people and talking stuff, and if you have a\\nchance to get back in the fight and don\\'t take it, i would have\\nbeen very disappointed in myself for not having the courage to do\\nthat.\"\\n\\nasked if coaching is different from when he led the wayne\\ngretzky kings to the 1993 stanley cup final, melrose dragged out\\nwhat he admits is an old line that exaggerates to make a point.\\n\\nthe kings, he said, had three players who were millionaires.\\n\"now, i have three who aren\\'t.\"\\n\\nseriously, have new defensive strategies and antiobstruction\\nrules made it a different game?\\n\\n\"that\\'s the easy answer,\" he said. \"but the good teams still\\nwin with

why,\" carter said emphatically. \"the\\nfirst time i got a chance to sit down with him and talk about our\\npass-protection scheme and the things that we do  he understood it\\nand could spit it back at me immediately. when he did that, i was a\\nhappy man. because i knew that if he could do that, he was ready.\\nthat was right when we started being able to do football stuff. he\\njust took off and could do it all. so we were really excited about\\nthat.\"\\n\\nalong with excitement, demps and rainey have brought a\\nlegitimate running game to the gators, something meyer didn\\'t have\\nin his previous three years at florida, outside of wide receiver\\npercy harvin. gators running backs have accounted for 896 yards on\\n127 carries and 10 touchdowns. they totaled 761 yards on 136\\ncarries last season.\\n\\ndemps and rainey emerged after the loss to ole miss, in which\\nsenior moore and transfer moody were injured.\\n\\nin the past three games, demps and rainey have carried 52 times\\nfor 487 yards and four rushing touchdowns. demps had consecutive\\n100-yard games (arkansas, lsu), and his 11.9 yards-per-carry\\naverage leads division i-a (minimum 25 attempts). his average\\ntouchdown run is 47 yards.\\n\\n\"i\\'m working as hard as i can, just trying to do whatever i can\\nto help my team,\" the soft-spoken demps said. \"i still have a lot\\nto learn.\"\\n\\nin the arkansas game oct. 4, the gators set a single-game record\\nfor rushing yards under meyer (278) and followed with the\\nsecond-best mark against then-no. 3 lsu.\\n\\nat \"5-foot-nothing\" as meyer jokingly refers to demps (5 feet\\n8, 176 pounds) and rainey (5-9, 185), the two pose a threat because\\nof their speed. demps has run 100 meters in 10.01 seconds and just\\nmissed qualifying for the final at the olympic trials this year.\\nrainey has run sub-4.4 for 40 yards and 10.23 in the 100. demps is\\nmore tough to defend in the speed-option because once he breaks\\nfree, he has the potential to make huge gains.\\n\\n\"(the option) allows me to get into space, and when i get into\\nspace, i can do a lot of things and get upfield,\" he said. \"when\\nyou get the pitch, you\\'re looking at your blocker first, just\\ntrying to make a read off the block. once you get past the block,\\nyou start looking downfield.\"\\n\\nmeyer said when he sees demps or rainey break free out of the\\nbackfield, \"i become like a fan. it\\'s a beautiful thing to\\nwatch.\"\\n\\nit\\'s also a tremendous help to quarterback tim tebow, broadening\\nthe offensive game plan.\\n\\n\"having them in the game just opens things up,\" the junior\\nsaid. \"their speed allows them to get to the edge. we can put them\\nin open space to try to create one-on-one matchups. they are so\\nfast and athletic, we can stretch the field horizontally.\"\\n\\nin the first seven games, demps has averaged 12.1 yards every\\ntime he touches the ball, rainey 6.8. and according to carter,\\ntheir potential is limitless.\\n\\n\"i told jeff and chris (this week) they have kind of a\\ntiger-woodish deal,\" carter said. \"because they are so fast, they\\nare at another level than everybody else. so if they play at their\\nlevel, they can really do some great things. but if they don\\'t play\\nat their level, then they are just average.\"\\n\\nin a game in which teams are so evenly matched, having the duo\\nplay at \"their level\" could be the difference between winning and\\nlosing for the gators in today\\'s rivalry game against georgia in\\njacksonville.\\n\\ntoday\\'s

to choose\\nwho gets money appears to be setting the stage for consolidation in\\nthe industry by favoring those most likely to survive.\\n\\nbut while the measures, closely guarded by treasury department\\nofficials, accommodate banks with top safety and soundness ratings,\\nthey also allow the government to apply a looser definition to some\\nbanks with lower ratings, according to two people briefed on the\\nprocess. some of those banks may have lost money over the past\\nyear, however, and should they fail the taxpayers\\' investment would\\nbe wiped out.\\n\\nanalysts said that giving capital to such weaker banks could run\\nagainst the spirit of treasury secretary henry m. paulson jr.\\'s\\nsuggestion that the program was for healthy institutions.\\n\\nso far, at least 22 small and regional banks have been awarded\\nmore than $38 billion in capital.\\n\\nthe treasury is concerned that publicizing its selection\\ncriteria would lead to speculation about which small and\\nmedium-size banks may not be qualified to receive the aid, said the\\npeople with knowledge of the process.\\n\\nsome lawmakers are upset that the capitalization program, which\\nthe government described as a way to jump-start lending, will end\\nup culling banks in their districts.\\n\\nregulators are applying a short list of criteria based on a\\nsecret ratings system they use to gauge a financial institution\\'s\\nhealth. these yardsticks, known as camel ratings, classify the\\nnation\\'s 8,500 banks into five categories, where a ranking of 1\\napplies to those in the best shape and a 5 to those in the worst.\\n\\nunder the program, banks with a rating of 1 or 2 are essentially\\nguaranteed to qualify for the investments, according to the people\\nbriefed on the process.\\n\\nthose in the bottom categories are unlikely to receive capital\\ninjections. as of june 30, that group included at least 117\\nfinancial institutions, mainly small banks and savings and loans,\\non the federal insurance deposit corp. list of problem banks.\\napproximately 2,500 to 3,500 banks, which likely have midtier camel\\nratings, are on the cusp of qualifying for the cash if they choose\\nto apply, analysts said.\\n\\nof those banks, those that have been profitable over the last\\nyear are the most likely to receive capital. banks that have lost\\nmoney over the last year, however, must pass additional tests.\\n\\nfederal banking regulators are also applying additional\\ncriteria, like assurances that banks are lending in low-income\\ncommunities, to determine eligibility.\\n\\nthey are also asking if a bank has enough capital and reserves\\nto withstand severe losses to its construction loan portfolio,\\nnonperforming loans and other troubled assets.\\n\\nbanks that fail to meet two of the guidelines are unlikely to\\nreceive the money, said a person with indirect knowledge of the\\nprocess. but banks that have only one strike against them can lobby\\nregulators for the cash.\\n\\nseveral advisers to financial institutions also said that they\\nwere aware of banks that received capital with the understanding\\nthe banks would try to find a merger partner. they said other banks\\nwere urged to slash their dividend if they sought cash. the\\nadvisers were not authorized by their clients to speak, and did not\\nname the banks.\\n\\nboth actions suggest that the government may be loosely defining\\nwhat constitutes healthy institutions.\\n\\nbanks are required to provide a specific business plan for the\\nnext two or three years and explain how they plan to deploy the\\ncapital. regulators, however, say that they will not examine how\\nthe financial institutions actually use the cash.\\n\\n\"there is no express statutory requirement that says you must\\nmake this amount of loans,\" john c. dugan, the comptroller of the\\ncurrency, one of the major banking regulators, said in a recent\\ninterview. \"but the economics work so that it is in their interest\\nto do so\" and that their actions would \"be open to the court of\\npublic opinion.\"\\n\\nstill, many lawmakers are concerned that some banks appear to be\\nholding on to the capital instead of immediately making loans to\\nspur economic growth. \"any use of these funds for any purpose\\nother than lending -- for bonuses, for severance pay, for dividends,\\nfor acquisitions of other institutions, etc. -- is a violation of\\nthe act,\" rep. barney frank, d-mass., chairman of the house\\nfinancial services committee, said in a statement on friday.\\n\\njustice antonin scalia has a reputation as an\\nintimidating jurist who poses withering questions during arguments\\nbefore the supreme court. but on friday afternoon, when the soprano\\nleontyne price entered the west conference room at the court to\\nattend an honorary luncheon hosted by the national endowment for\\nthe arts, scalia, an avid opera fan, visibly melted.\\n\\n\"it\\'s a great honor to meet you,\" he told price, his face\\ncrinkling with warmth and delight. when price complimented him on\\nthe elegance of the luncheon\\'s setting -- a paneled salon, its walls\\nlined with portraits of past chief justices -- he replied, \"yes,\\nthese are pretty nice rooms,\" adding, \"and they\\'re yours today.\"\\n\\nthere had been a similar greeting moments earlier when, before\\nthe luncheon, price entered the chamber of justice ruth bader\\nginsburg, another passionate and highly informed opera buff. when\\nthe justice opened the doors to her office, price, who at 81 seemed\\never the prima donna, knelt on one knee before her. it was a\\ngesture price mastered decades ago, when she would appear before\\nthe curtain to thank audiences for their ovations.\\n\\n\"what a joy,\" ginsburg said, beaming and taking price\\'s hand.\\n\"my, this magnificent woman.\"\\n\\nthe occasion was the inauguration of a series of awards from the\\nendowment acknowledging lasting contributions to opera. called the\\nnea opera honors, they are the first new awards from the federal\\ngovernment for individual achievement in the arts in 26 years.\\n\\nalong with price, the other honorees in this first year are the\\nconductor james levine, the composer carlisle floyd (best known for\\nhis operas \"susannah\" and \"of mice and men,\" which have become\\nrepertory works) and the english-born impresario richard gaddes,\\nwho has had long and pivotal tenures directing the opera theater of\\nst. louis and the santa fe opera, where he recently stepped down as\\ngeneral director.\\n\\nthe day represented \"a meeting of art and justice,\" said dana\\ngioia, the chairman of the endowment, in welcoming the honorees,\\ntheir guests and other invitees to the luncheon.\\n\\nthe endowment has come under criticism in recent years by\\nlegislators who seek to influence its policies and priorities. and\\nits budget, which last year was $148 million, has risen and fallen\\nwith the times. in a brief interview, gioia said he hoped that the\\nstrong public reception to these awards would be seen \"as an\\nexpression of the regard in which the nea is still held.\"\\n\\nperhaps the most fascinating aspects of the luncheon were the\\nrevealing glimpses of the justices as smitten buffs. gioia invited\\nthe court\\'s opera lovers -- scalia, ginsburg and justice anthony m.\\nkennedy -- to serve as hosts for the luncheon; all three readily\\naccepted. as ginsburg said, in welcoming the guests, \"when dana\\ngioia asked us, i took a cue from nancy reagan and just said, \\'may\\nwe?\"\\'\\n\\ngreat sopranos have long dominated the opera world, and price\\nwas the center of attention on this day. touring ginsburg\\'s\\ntemporary chambers (the justices\\' permanent offices are being\\nrenovated), price, accompanied by her younger brother, george\\nprice, a retired united states army general, was visibly overcome.\\n\\n\"what would our parents say?\" she asked her brother, thinking\\nof their origins in laurel, miss., where her mother was a midwife\\nand her father a handyman.\\n\\nginsburg, 75, told price that she and her husband, prof. martin\\nd. ginsburg, who also attended the luncheon, were in the audience\\nwhen price made her sensational metropolitan opera debut, on jan.\\n27, 1961, as leonora in verdi\\'s \"trovatore,\" the same night that\\nthe renowned tenor franco corelli made his met debut as manrico:\\n\"it was a \\'trovatore\\' like no other we have ever attended,\" she\\nsaid.\\n\\nginsburg said she remembered very clearly that before one of the\\nacts, price\\'s parents, proudly sitting in a box at the met, were\\nintroduced, and a spotlight shone on them. \"i\\'m not going to\\ncry,\" price said, \"though my mascara is starting to run.\"\\n\\nginsburg showed price a cabinet lined with photographs of\\nherself standing with opera singers she admires, including luciano\\npavarotti, renee fleming and denyce graves. \"maybe before the day\\nis out i\\'ll have a photo with you,\" she said.\\n\\nthe only honoree missing from the luncheon was levine, who spent\\nfriday afternoon in rehearsals for the met\\'s new production of\\nberlioz\\'s \"damnation of faust,\" which opens friday. in addition,\\nillness forced him to miss the formal awards ceremony and concert\\non friday evening, with placido domingo and israel gursky\\nconducting vocalists and the orchestra of the washington national\\nopera at the harman center for the arts.\\n\\nas ginsburg and scalia chatted before lunch, they recalled a\\ndisagreement about the washington national opera\\'s much-debated\\nproduction of puccini\\'s \"boheme,\" which opened the season a year\\nago. the director, mariusz trelinski, had boldly updated and\\ncontemporized the opera, and ginsburg did not like it, she said,\\nfrowning.\\n\\n\"ruth is a harsh opera critic,\" scalia said. \"i\\'m supposed to\\nbe the stodgy one, but i loved it.\"\\n\\nscalia, 72, grew up in queens, an only child of music-loving\\nparents. \"my father gave me piano lessons until i was a junior in\\nhigh school,\" he said. \"i used to be pretty good.\"\\n\\nhis love of opera started in his youth, when his father, a\\nprofessor at brooklyn college, took him to the college theater to\\nsee a production of puccini\\'s \"gianni schicchi.\" in retrospect,\\nthat opera could be seen as a fitting choice for a future jurist:\\nset in renaissance italy, it is a comedy about a falsified will.\\n\\n\"i loved \\'gianni schicchi,\\' and i still love it,\" scalia said,\\nbreaking into a smile.\\n\\nin her welcoming remarks at the luncheon, ginsburg also singled\\nout the contributions of the other honorees. she said she had been\\nmoved deeply by the washington national opera\\'s productions of\\nfloyd\\'s \"susannah\" and \"of mice and men.\" and she has long been\\na fan of gaddes\\' work at the santa fe opera.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve been going every summer,\" she said. \"once i discovered\\nthe santa fe opera, i stopped going to salzburg and glyndebourne.\"\\n\\nduring the meal, an unexpected pleasure quieted the luncheon\\ncrowd of several dozen. the sunrise quartet, which had been playing\\nstring quartet arrangements of opera arias, began \"un bel di\\nvedremo\" from puccini\\'s \"madama butterfly.\" cio-cio-san, the\\nopera\\'s tragic heroine, was one of price\\'s great roles. from her\\nseat near the players, price started singing the aria, softly at\\nfirst, then nearly in full voice. even a hint of that gloriously\\nfamiliar voice stopped conversations. she sang right through to the\\nfinal high b flat.\\n\\nkennedy, who was seated next to her, appeared elated. as people\\napplauded, he lifted a corner of his eyeglasses to wipe away what\\nlooked like a tear.\\n\\ngod and satan duke it out for the soul of a troubled girl in\\n\"the haunting of molly hartley,\" an unexpectedly cynical addition\\nto the teen-scream genre that opened nationwide on friday.\\n\\nlife could not possibly be worse for the 17-year-old molly\\n(haley bennett). for one thing, her mother (marin hinkle) is raving\\nin a psych ward after taking a pair of scissors to molly\\'s chest;\\nfor another, the uniform required by her snobby new school is\\nextremely unflattering. no wonder she hears voices and sees\\nvisions.\\n\\nluckily, lots of people want to save her, including the local\\nbad seed (shannon marie woodward) -- identified by her strategically\\nripped tights -- and a creepy evangelist (shanna collins) who\\'d like\\nto be molly\\'s bff but whose fundamentalist frocks are early\\ndisqualifiers.\\n\\nmuch more attractive are the rich-guy wardrobe and white-knight\\nattentions of joseph (chace crawford), the kind of fortunate son\\nwho thrives primarily by hosting plantation-style parties.\\n\\n\"the darkness is coming for you!\" screams an apparition of\\nmolly\\'s mom after one such event, leaving molly to wonder why she\\ncan\\'t just be grounded like everyone else.\\n\\ntame and inoffensive (unless you\\'re on the lord\\'s side), \"the\\nhaunting of molly hartley\" is no more than a big-screen lasso for\\nthe \"gossip girl\" and \"supernatural\" demographic. the press\\nnotes rave about its \"hot, young cast, all on the verge of\\nbreaking out.\" i hear they have creams for that.\\n\\nthe haunting of molly hartley\\n\\ndirected by mickey liddell; written by john travis and rebecca\\nsonnenshine; director of photography, sharone meir; edited by zene\\nbaker;

\\'n\\' roller\\nhas just endured the humiliation of opening for the borscht-beltish\\nshecky greene.\\n\\nthe roar of laughter that greets this seemingly heartfelt avowal\\nin the musical \"million dollar quartet\" can be explained simply\\nenough. the boy with the baby face is elvis presley, still in the\\nmiddle innings of his recording and film career, at least a decade\\naway from the peanut-butter-and-banana-sandwich bulges and the\\nrhinestone-encrusted white jumpsuits. never say ain\\'t never, elvis.\\n\\nthis pouting youngster is not the only bright-eyed guitar\\nstrummer with career problems in this lively little jukebox\\nmusical, which boasts a set of gold-plated platters that puts most\\nof the rest of the karaoke competition in the shade.\\n\\n\"million dollar quartet\" is set in the studio of sun records\\nin memphis during the very hours in which its celebrated stature\\nwas cemented. on dec. 4, 1956, sam phillips, the record producer\\nwho founded sun and has been called the father of rock \\'n\\' roll,\\nhosted a jam session and impromptu recording with elvis, jerry lee\\nlewis, johnny cash and carl perkins. it was the only occasion on\\nwhich all shared a studio, and has entered music history as one of\\nthose golden-hued, fantastical hours in which a whole pantheon of\\ngods frolicked together.\\n\\nthis slick, fictionalized re-creation of that hallowed night,\\npreviously seen in florida and washington state (and rumored to be\\nbroadway-bound), is what you might call a no-brainer baby boomer\\nmoney-spinner. it packed audiences into the goodman theater\\'s\\nsmaller stage for several weeks this fall (i saw the last\\nperformance at the goodman on sunday), and began performances on\\nfriday night for a run through jan. 4 at the apollo theater here.\\n\\nas the actors playing the rock luminaries gradually assemble\\nonstage, each bearing a modest resemblance to the fabled performer\\nhe is portraying, a faint air of the animatronic threatens to\\nsettle over the proceedings. you fear the show will be sort of a\\ndisneyland rock \\'n\\' roll icons jamboree.\\n\\nbut the performers -- some actors who can play guitar, others\\nmusicians trying the acting thing -- are genial, winning and\\npersuasive without lapsing into hackneyed or overripe\\nimpersonation. the songs, a stack of early rock hip-shakers,\\nincluding \"blue suede shoes,\" \"great balls of fire\" and \"whole\\nlotta shakin\\' goin\\' on,\" are performed with a vibrant commitment\\nthat keeps the sea of gray heads in the audience bobbing, bobbing,\\nbobbing throughout the show\\'s fleet 90-minute running time.\\n\\nthe book, by the rock historian colin escott and the movie\\nwriter-director floyd mutrux (\"american hot wax\"), has plenty of\\nforced transitions and mechanically inserted bits of trivia. at one\\npoint a luscious blonde strides into the studio and, with little\\npreamble, grabs a microphone and starts crooning \"fever.\" her\\npresence remains unexplained until the song is over. turns out\\nshe\\'s elvis\\' girl, although elvis himself has not yet arrived. go\\nfigure.\\n\\nthe chief generator of suspense is the financial peril faced by\\nphillips (the amiable brian mccaskill), who steps in and out of the\\nshow, annotating the proceedings with lore and background as it\\ngoes along, in the process reminding us a little too frequently\\nthat he discovered all these boys, \"taught them to believe in\\nthemselves and made them stars.\" about a year before this fateful\\nnight phillips had to sell elvis\\' contract to rca to keep his\\nrecord company alive. (he received just $40,000 for it -- ouch! --\\nbut, as he informs us, wink-wink, he did invest some of the money\\nin a little outfit called holiday inn.)\\n\\nnow the contract of his current chart-topper, johnny cash, is\\nabout to expire. phillips has a new one on hand, and plans to\\nspring it on johnny when the whiskey\\'s flowing and the boys are\\ntrading guitar licks and reminiscing about the desperate days when\\nthey were touring the south in the back of a flatbed truck.\\n\\nthe characterizations are economical but adequate. the\\nhotheaded, loudmouthed jerry lee lewis (levi kreis) is new to the\\nlabel and wants to prove his mettle. kreis just about pounds a hole\\nin the stage floor with his converse high tops when he starts\\nflailing away on the keyboard. jerry lee\\'s cockiness antagonizes\\ncarl perkins (a charismatic rob lyons), who is also sore because\\nhis records aren\\'t selling and because phillips had allowed elvis\\nto sing perkins\\' hit song \"blue suede shoes\" on television.\\n\\njohnny, gracefully played by lance guest, is the courtly country\\ngentleman, pained at having to break bad news to the man who\\njump-started his career. eddie clendening, who plays elvis, is\\nobviously not a trained actor, but he gives a gentle, likable\\nperformance. his honey-coated vibrato is perfectly suited to the\\nsongs.\\n\\nwhile the book and the songs are not particularly\\nwell-integrated -- after a little banter and maybe a flashback to\\nthe rough old days, somebody will just step up to the mike and\\nbreak into a familiar tune -- the directors, mutrux and eric\\nschaeffer, don\\'t ease up on the gas pedal long enough for you to\\ncomplain. and mutrux and escott have come up with a few sharp\\nzingers to warm things up between numbers. johnny, unhappy about\\nphillips\\' shambolic organization, grouses about his latest record\\nsales, \"if they really want to stop the spread of communism, they\\nought to let sun distribute

championship\\nparade down broad street. the phillies gave them one friday, and so\\nmany fans showed up that they nearly shut down the city.\\n\\nwhen the phillies defeated the tampa bay rays on wednesday night\\nto capture the world series title, they delivered this city its\\nfirst major sports championship since 1983, when the 76ers won the\\nnba finals. the phillies\\' only other title came in 1980.\\n\\nthe parade started in center city, passed city hall and traveled\\nnearly four miles south to the phillies\\' home field, citizens bank\\npark. it started at noon and crawled at a speed of about 4 miles\\nper hour, arriving in south philadelphia more than an hour later\\nthan expected, about 3 p.m.\\n\\nthe police and city officials estimated that more than a million\\nfans packed the route, and the crowds overwhelmed the public\\ntransit system. septa, which runs the city\\'s subway system and\\nregional rail lines, temporarily shut down the broad street line,\\nwhich connects center city to the sports complex area. the patco\\nhigh-speed line, which runs to new jersey, was also jammed. some\\nfans chose to walk home instead of waiting for trains.\\n\\nat times, mayor michael a. nutter and phillies manager charlie\\nmanuel held up the world series trophy while players waved to fans.\\nleft fielder pat burrell led the procession in a horse-drawn\\ncarriage, which was followed by flatbed trucks filled with players\\nand other members of the organization. center fielder shane\\nvictorino tossed soft pretzels to the crowd, and shortstop jimmy\\nrollins turned his video camera on the fans.\\n\\nthe phillies then greeted tens of thousands of fans who had\\nwatched the parade on big screens at the city\\'s baseball and\\nfootball stadiums. the team first stopped at lincoln financial\\nfield, where the eagles play.\\n\\n\"this is the biggest parade i\\'ve ever been in,\" manuel told\\nthe fans. \"it\\'s like christmas came two months early.\"\\n\\nthe phillies then headed to citizens bank park, where a red\\n\"2008\" banner was raised to celebrate their world series title.\\n\\nthe clear sky and a 60-degree temperature was a contrast to the\\ncold, windy and rainy conditions that forced the suspension of game\\n5 on monday and prevented the game from being completed until\\nwednesday. fans packed sidewalks, climbed trees, hung out of\\nwindows, watched from balconies and stood on roofs for a better\\nview.\\n\\nrich and michelle boyle of archbald, pa., both 39, stayed\\novernight in center city so they could take their two sons,\\n10-year-old r.j. and 6-year-old jeremy, to the parade. they secured\\na spot along market street, near the start of route.\\n\\n\"we\\'re die-hard phillies fans, so we had to let them come and\\nsee their first parade, hopefully not their last,\" rich boyle\\nsaid. \"i didn\\'t go to the last one. my dad said i had to wait\\nuntil i was old enough. i talked to him last night, and he said i\\nwas old enough to go now.\"\\n\\nr.j. was missing a halloween parade, but he said, \"i\\'d rather\\nbe here.\" he dressed as a phillies player, and his brother wore a\\ngreen jersey for his costume as an eagles football player.\\n\\ncarol golden, 47, and david golden, 43, of cherry hill, n.j.,\\nalso let their sons skip school. \"they\\'ll get a lot more education\\nout of this than if they were in school,\" david golden said.\\n\\nthe parade drew fans from beyond the region, too. greg packer,\\n44, of huntington, n.y., drove in for game 5 of the world series\\nand stayed for the celebration. he arrived on broad street near\\ncity hall at 5 a.m. to secure what he considered the best spot.\\n\\n\"in new york right now, we have no mets, no yankees, no\\nstadiums,\" he said. \"i came here to represent and cheer our\\nneighbors.\"\\n\\nearly in the giants\\' workout on friday,\\nmuch of the wire fence around their practice field was without the\\nusual blue plastic sheets. anyone could peer through it. spies from\\nthe dallas cowboys could have discovered secret plays.\\n\\n\"to be honest with you, i didn\\'t even notice it,\" coach tom\\ncoughlin said of the see-through barrier. \"they are supposed to be\\ncovered all of the time anyway. so, if it was uncovered then,\\nsomehow, some way, something happened there.\"\\n\\nby the time practice ended, the sheets were back in place. but\\nit is doubtful that the cowboys could have learned much of anything\\nbefore the national football conference east rivals meet sunday at\\ngiants stadium. these teams already know each other too well.\\n\\nthe giants (6-1) played the cowboys (5-3) three times last\\nseason and 92 times since 1960, when the cowboys joined the nfl.\\ndallas won both regular-season games in 2007, but the giants beat\\nthe favored cowboys in the playoffs, en route to the super bowl\\ntitle.\\n\\nthis game is one of the best this weekend. entering the season,\\nthe cowboys were the trendy pick to win the championship. some\\ngiants resented that; others laughed it off.\\n\\n\"like i said in training camp, everybody crowned certain\\npeople,\" plaxico burress said. \"you still have to line up and go\\nplay. i have seen a lot of crazy things happen in this league.\"\\n\\ndallas has been weakened by injuries. among the wounded is\\nquarterback tony romo, out for a third consecutive game with a\\nbroken finger, and tight end jason witten, questionable with a\\nbroken rib.\\n\\nantonio pierce, a middle linebacker, assessed these factors as\\nthe giants reached the midseason mark.\\n\\n\"they are still the dallas cowboys,\" pierce said. \"everybody\\nhates everybody in this league. this rivalry has gotten even more\\nintense. they have been titled america\\'s team, and they are coming\\nto the big apple. so it should be fun.\"\\n\\nromo could be back for dallas\\' next game. in his place sunday,\\nthe cowboys will again use 40-year-old brad johnson, playing with\\nhis fifth team in his 17th season. on defense, dallas will be\\nwithout cornerback terence newman (sports hernia) and cornerback\\nadam jones, formerly pacman, who is in alcohol rehabilitation.\\ncornerback anthony henry (thigh injury) is probable.\\n\\nthe depleted secondary should be tested by eli manning and his\\nreceivers. \"we can try to throw the ball downfield, but it is\\nalways a battle,\" manning said. \"we know each other very well.\"\\n\\nmanning will be pursued by linebacker demarcus ware, who leads\\nthe cowboys in sacks with nine. the dallas offense is bolstered by\\nrunning back marion barber, who has 153 carries for 611 yards and\\nfive touchdowns.\\n\\nif johnson can find them, his receivers include terrell owens\\nand roy williams, recently acquired from detroit. but owens has\\nonly 13 catches for 167 yards and a touchdown in the last four\\ngames.\\n\\nhis relative drought began before romo was injured. \"it is\\nfrustrating,\" owens said in a video clip on nfl.com. \"you\\'ve got\\nto have faith. there were some one-on-one opportunities last game.\\nwe just didn\\'t connect.\"\\n\\nthe giants have many tools, including a sack attack that leads\\nthe league with 26 and a rushing attack that leads the league in\\nyards per game with 157.3. the team also leads the league in a\\ncategory most would not guess -- safeties, with two. in the last two\\ngames, victories against san francisco and pittsburgh, the giants\\nhave scored on these rare plays.\\n\\neven the word itself is versatile in this sport. it applies to\\ntwo defensive positions (\"free\" and \"strong\"), and it also\\napplies to the general health of a team avoiding injuries. coughlin\\nsmiled when asked about the two-game streak of 2-point safeties.\\n\\n\"what do i think of them?\" he said. \"i hope they work for\\nus.\" indeed, in pro football, you can never be too safe. that is\\nwhy coaches want their fences covered on their practice fields, to\\nplay it safe.\\n\\nbrace yourself, floridians. with the sunshine state positioned\\nto decide tuesday\\'s presidential election, the state will be loaded\\nwith star-studded

delgado.\\n\\ngiven that the mets were already committed to giving him a $4\\nmillion buyout if they had not picked up his option, paying delgado\\nan extra $8 million could be a bargain if he can come close to\\nduplicating his second-half surge.\\n\\n\"carlos is a key part of our plans for 2009, and we wanted to\\nlet him know as quickly as allowed that we wanted him back,\"\\ngeneral manager omar minaya said in a statement.\\n\\n\"yesterday -- the day following the conclusion of the world\\nseries -- was the first day that we could pick up the option per the\\ncontract. it was our full intent to promptly close our deal with\\ncarlos, and that\\'s what we did.\"\\n\\ndelgado, 36, rebounded from a miserable first three months -- he\\nwas batting .228 through the end of june -- to hit .271 with a\\nteam-high 38 home runs and 115 runs batted in, his best statistical\\nseason of his three with the team. after july 1, he batted .313\\nwith 24 homers, 70 rbis and a .617 slugging percentage. only two\\nplayers in each of the last three categories had higher marks than\\ndelgado over that span.\\n\\ndelgado\\'s defense, never an asset, also seemed to improve as his\\nproduction increased.\\n\\nwith delgado\\'s value at its peak, and given that he plans to\\nplay a few more seasons (he is 31 homers shy of 500), the mets are\\nnot necessarily wedded to having him on first base next season.\\nalthough it is not a priority, the mets may explore dealing him to\\nthe american league, where he could serve as a designated hitter.\\n\\nsuch a deal could shore up the mets\\' relief corps and starting\\nrotation. although they still intend to pursue at least one starter\\nand a closer (and, perhaps, a second baseman) on the free-agent\\nmarket, the mets seem more likely to fill most of their needs via\\ntrades.\\n\\nnadine mcneil will reach the crest of the\\nverrazano-narrows bridge on her handcycle soon after 7:30 sunday\\nmorning. moments later, she will roll swiftly past her 18-year-old\\nson, tyler, who is autistic. this will be her fourth marathon, and\\ntyler\\'s first. she has grown uneasy this week thinking of the\\nmoment when she will leave him behind.\\n\\n\"i can\\'t look back,\" she said. \"for 18 years, i\\'ve always\\nknown every moment where tyler is. on sunday, i won\\'t.\"\\n\\nthough joint parent-child appearances in the new york city\\nmarathon are not uncommon -- rod dixon, the race\\'s 1983 champion, is\\nreturning this year to run the race with his daughter -- the path\\nthat brought nadine, 42, and tyler to the marathon is an unlikely\\none. nadine had a stroke when she was 8 and lost the use of her\\nright arm and her right leg. tyler, her only child, is severely\\nspeech-delayed. even now. at 6 feet 4 inches, he communicates\\nverbally by using one or two words at a time.\\n\\nnadine has poured her life into her son. tyler, in turn, is what\\nshe calls \"my right arm.\" he compensates for her disabilities by\\ntying her shoes. he does her buttons and zippers. if she tries to\\nput on her coat, he will immediately rush to her side and gently\\nlift her right arm into the sleeve.\\n\\nneither would have ever made it to this year\\'s starting line\\nwithout the other.\\n\\ntheir path to the marathon began when tyler was 7. nadine\\narrived with her son at hunter college to see the director of\\nproject happy, a program that provides athletic and recreational\\nactivities to new york city youth with disabilities. nadine was by\\nthen a single mother living in the bronx. she had already been\\nturned away from athletic programs at the bronx y, the 92nd street\\ny and the 53rd street y because of tyler\\'s tantrums and other\\nbehavior.\\n\\n\"he came in with his mother,\" said penny shaw, the 71-year-old\\ndirector of project happy. \"he had no language. he did nothing but\\nscream. we had never seen a child like that, and we certainly had\\nnever taken one into the program. but the mother was so nice, i\\nsaid we would try.\"\\n\\nsoon after tyler enrolled, shaw and her staff recognized that he\\nwas a natural athlete. when he picked up a basketball, he would\\nthrow it in the hoop with almost mathematical precision. nadine had\\nalso started taking tyler to achilles kids, a running and rolling\\nprogram for children with disabilities. to get him to events, she\\nhad to leave the bronx for manhattan at 5:30 a.m.\\n\\ntyler\\'s behavior began to improve during his involvement in\\nachilles kids and project happy. he has since won dozens of medals\\nin the special olympics, particularly in swimming. \"this child was\\nsaved by sports,\" shaw said.\\n\\nnadine had never considered that athletics could serve a similar\\nrole in her own life. at achilles kids, she would guard the bags\\nand the coats while tyler ran. one day in august 2006, dick traum,\\nan amputee who founded the achilles adult program, mentioned to\\nnadine that she should consider racing in a marathon.\\n\\n\"i laughed,\" nadine said. \"he said i could do it in a\\nhandcycle. i was like, \\'dick, my right arm?\"\\'\\n\\nthree months later, in november 2006, nadine found herself at\\nthe starting line in staten island. she had attached her paralyzed\\nright arm to the handcycle\\'s pedal mechanism with duct tape from\\nhome depot. she powered the chair with her left arm and finished\\nthe marathon in 4 hours 3 minutes.\\n\\nas nadine trained for more races, tyler would jog by her\\nwheelchair. nadine began to notice a difference in her supposedly\\nfrozen arm: it had gained some power and even some range of motion.\\nher doctor noticed, too.\\n\\n\"it has become much stronger in just the past year with all the\\npractice she\\'s had,\" said regina coyne, nadine\\'s general\\npractitioner.\\n\\nlast november, tyler became confused when nadine boarded the bus\\nto travel to the marathon starting line. he wanted to go with her.\\nhis mother persuaded him to let her go by saying that he was not\\nallowed to run the race until he was 18.\\n\\nafter tyler turned 18 in july, nadine took him to his doctor,\\nwho performed an ekg and said tyler was physically capable.\\n\\ntyler\\'s school for special-needs students in the bronx, p.s.\\n176, held a pep rally for him wednesday. he marched around the\\nseating bowl of the auditorium while holding an american flag, and\\nhis fellow students -- some of them holding purple, green or orange\\npompoms -- sang karaoke versions of \"my country \\'tis of thee,\"\\n\"we will rock you\" and \"we are the champions.\"\\n\\none of tyler\\'s friends, sean, 19, who is also autistic, took the\\nmicrophone and said solemnly: \"tyler, i have two words to say to\\nyou: good luck at the marathon, and i love you.\"\\n\\ntyler will run the race with one of his special-education\\nteachers, vinny bruno. his mother has decided not to try to slow\\nher chair and ride beside him. after 18 years, she wants to allow\\nhim to become more independent -- a shift that is as difficult for\\nher as for him.\\n\\nshe thinks back to when he was 3 and the doctors suggested that\\nhe would never even be toilet trained, let alone be an athlete. she\\nhas had trouble sleeping this week, mostly because she knows him so\\nwell.\\n\\n\"he\\'s going to try his hardest to get to that finish line,\\nwhether it hurts, whether it drives him nuts,\" she said. \"he\\'s\\ngoing to keep coming until he sees me.\"\\n\\nthere is such a thing as a free lunch -- or at least a free\\nrecipe -- but the founders of cookstr, a new web site, do hope that\\nhome cooks will eventually pay.\\n\\nalthough the internet is already flooded with recipes, will\\nschwalbe, who stepped down as editor in chief of hyperion books in\\njanuary, is starting cookstr to showcase the recipes of star chefs\\nlike jamie oliver, nigella lawson and mario batali, as well as\\nthose of less-well-known but highly regarded cookbook writers. the\\nidea, ultimately, is to sell copies of these authors\\' books.\\n\\non the site, www.cookstr.com, which goes live this month, each\\nrecipe will appear on a page with a prominently placed picture of\\nthe source cookbook\\'s cover, as well as a link to one of four\\nonline retailers selling the book.\\n\\nmost people who want to cook at home eventually look up a recipe\\nonline. according to comscore, an internet marketing research\\ncompany, food sites attracted 45.6 million unique visitors in\\nseptember, up 10 percent from a year ago, more than double the rate\\nof total internet growth in the united states.\\n\\nat the same time, the internet is shaking up the publishing\\nindustry, as authors in all genres debate whether giving away\\ncontent generates or diminishes sales. in some respects, cookbooks\\nwould seem particularly vulnerable, because recipes are\\nself-contained in a way that a chapter of a novel is not.\\n\\nbut schwalbe -- along with more than a dozen publishers and 100\\ncookbook authors who have signed up to contribute recipes to the\\nsite -- believes that a carefully chosen selection of recipes will\\nwhet the appetites of prospective cookbook buyers.\\n\\nduring a recent interview in the downtown manhattan offices of\\ntipping point, an internet startup incubator that is helping to get\\ncookstr going, schwalbe, 46, pointed to the examples of martha\\nstewart and rachael ray, kitchen queens who post thousands of\\nrecipes online and yet remain top-selling cookbook writers.\\n(neither is contributing to cookstr.)\\n\\n\"there are just so many people who go to the web to look for\\nrecipes,\" schwalbe said. \"and that is a great moment to remind\\nthem that the best recipes in the world are in books, to introduce\\nthem to authors they might not know about.\"\\n\\ncookbooks remain stalwart performers in publishing. last year,\\nbooks in the food and entertaining category sold 13.9 million\\ncopies, though that was down from 14.9 million a year earlier,\\naccording to nielsen bookscan, which tracks about 70 percent of\\nsales. so far this year, cookbook sales are slightly up, before\\naccounting for the crucial forthcoming holiday season.\\n\\nmany authors have their own web sites, and there are dozens of\\nother sites where home cooks can find recipes, including\\nallrecipes.com, epicurious.com and foodnetwork.com.\\n\\nbut these sites tend to feature recipes contributed by users or\\nthose that have appeared in food magazines. the foodnetwork.com\\nsite primarily offers recipes of the cooks who appear on its\\ntelevision shows.\\n\\ncookstr, which will be supported by advertising revenues, will\\naggregate recipes from published cookbooks. all of the authors will\\nhave their own pages, with biographies, links to recipes and books,\\nand in the case of restaurant chefs, links to their locations on\\ngoogle maps.\\n\\nvisitors to the site can search for recipes using a wide range\\nof parameters, from the more obvious -- ingredients, season,\\noccasion -- to more specialized criteria, like lactose-free,\\nkid-friendly or requires-only-one-pot-to-cook. the site will start\\nwith 2,500 recipes, most likely to increase to 10,000 within a\\nyear.\\n\\nschwalbe, who wrote \"send: the essential guide to email for\\noffice and home\" with david shipley, the deputy editorial page\\neditor at the new york times, said he was financing the startup\\ncosts of cookstr -- which he said are less than $1 million -- with\\nsavings, the proceeds from \"send\" and the help of investments by\\nfamily and friends. he added that many vendors were providing\\nservices on a deferred basis.\\n\\nhe has appointed katie workman, 40 -- the daughter of peter\\nworkman, the founder of the workman publishing co., a well-known\\nname in cookbooks -- to be editor in chief and chief marketing\\nofficer, as well as a partner in the site.\\n\\nschwalbe, who left hyperion after 11 years at the company, has\\nstrong relationships with many cookbook authors, as he has edited\\nmany of them, including oliver and lawson.\\n\\noliver, a british chef whose books include \"cook with jamie\"\\nand \"jamie at home,\" wrote in an e-mail message that he was also\\nattracted by cookstr\\'s business model, in which publishers and\\nauthors share a portion of the ad revenues.\\n\\n\"my recipes are valuable, and will\\'s treating them as such,\"\\noliver, who will also be a consultant to cookstr, wrote. \"sites\\nare ringing up the office every day asking for free recipes. i\\ndon\\'t ring up the clothes shop and ask for free patterns and the\\ntypes of fabric so i can make my own clothes.\"\\n\\npublishers said they hoped that cookstr could help draw\\nattention not only to new books, but also to older titles that had\\nfallen out of sight.\\n\\n\"the reality is that there are more than 400 new cookbooks\\npublished every year,\" said leslie stoker, publisher of stewart,\\ntabori &amp;amp; chang, which publishes cookbooks by jacques pepin, arthur\\nschwartz and alain ducasse. \"so bookstores and online retailers\\nhave to make room for the new things, and most of the older books\\nget pushed aside.\"\\n\\nschwalbe will be asking the cooks he knows best, like lawson, a\\nbritish television personality whose books include \"how to eat\"\\nand \"feast: food to celebrate life,\" to identify authors he might\\nnot know about.\\n\\n\"i feel television only gives certain people prominence,\"\\nlawson said in a telephone interview. \"but there are plenty of\\npeople who have brilliant recipes who don\\'t have a television\\nshow.\"\\n\\nmollie katzen, author of \"the moosewood cookbook,\" said she\\nwas not worried about the site\\'s pre-empting book sales. \"there\\'s\\na whole lot more than the sum of its parts, a kind of presence and\\nambience that a book has that isn\\'t just a critical mass of\\nrecipes,\" katzen said. \"a lot of the feedback that people have\\ngiven me on my books is that they like to curl up in a chair with\\nit.\"\\n\\njoan nathan, the author of \"jewish cooking in america\" and\\n\"the new american cooking,\" said she suspected that the current\\nubiquity of recipes online had diminished sales of her most recent\\nbook. but she hoped cookstr might still attract new buyers.\\n\\n\"who knows?\" nathan said. \"i guess i hope for something\\nwonderful. the worst-case scenario for me is that people use my\\nrecipes.\"\\n\\ngen. robert h. barrow, the 27th commandant of the marine corps\\nwho served heroically in world war ii, the korean war and the\\nvietnam war, then went on to reform marine recruiting and training,\\ndied on thursday in st. francisville, la. he was 86.\\n\\nthe marine corps announced his death.\\n\\nbarrow combined southern courtliness, fierce devotion to marine\\ntradition and courage reflected in dozens of awards. he was awarded\\nthe navy cross in korea and the army distinguished service cross in\\nvietnam, both of which are second only to the medal of honor.\\n\\nas the marine manpower chief in 1976, barrow was instrumental in\\ndrafting reforms designed to end physical abuse and harassment of\\nrecruit trainees by drill instructors. the new york times, quoting\\nmilitary officials, reported in 1979 that the training reforms,\\nwhich included closer supervision by officers, had worked well.\\n\\nat the time, the general said the corps would not ease the tough\\nphysical conditioning that was a hallmark of marine boot camps. but\\nhe demanded that there be no more \"excess stress\" on recruits,\\nincluding \"nose-to-nose yelling\" by drill sergeants.\\n\\nbarrow also succeeded in raising the quality of recruits, in\\npart by seeking out high school graduates. in 1975, less than half\\nhad high school diplomas; by 1982, 82 percent did.\\n\\nrobert hilliard barrow was born feb. 5, 1922, in baton rouge,\\nla., and grew up on his family\\'s rosale plantation in west\\nfeliciana parish, la. the family\\'s circumstances were difficult,\\nhowever. they had no electricity, so robert satisfied his early\\npassion for reading by using a kerosene lamp.\\n\\nhe went to louisiana state university, because it offered free\\ntuition at the time and modest boarding costs. he worked as a\\nwaiter and janitor and served in the university\\'s corps of cadets,\\nas all physically fit students -- only men were admitted then -- were\\nrequired to do.\\n\\nafter pearl harbor, barrow, inspired by the marines\\' heroic but\\nultimately unsuccessful defense of wake island in december 1941,\\nwas attracted by a double-page marine corps recruiting ad in the\\nbaton rouge morning advocate.\\n\\nhe joined the marines in march 1942. he could have stayed to\\ngraduate because of his membership in the university\\'s corps but\\ninstead asked for active duty in november 1942, allan r. millett\\nand jack shulimson wrote in \"commandants of the marine corps\"\\n(2004).\\n\\nbarrow was disappointed in his preparation during the six-week\\nboot camp in san diego, undoubtedly setting the stage for his later\\ntraining reforms. the book quoted him as saying that the experience\\n\"was not one that prepared someone to go off and be a fighting\\nmember of a fighting organization.\"\\n\\nbarrow stayed on as a drill instructor, then went on to officer\\ncandidate school and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in may\\n1943. he ended up being deployed to china, where he led a u.s. team\\nfighting with a chinese guerrilla force behind japanese lines. he\\nwas awarded a bronze star with combat \"v.\"\\n\\nduring the korean war, barrow fulfilled diverse assignments,\\nincluding the inchon-seoul operation, a daring amphibious strike\\nled by gen. douglas macarthur, and the chosin reservoir campaign,\\nin which u.s. troops fought valiantly to hold off invading chinese\\nbefore being forced to withdraw. lynn montross the corps\\' chief\\nhistorian at the time, called him \"the most outstanding company\\ncommander of the war.\"\\n\\nin 1952, barrow was lent by the marine corps to a top-secret\\nmission on a string of islands north of taiwan, the marine corps\\nsaid in its announcement of his death.\\n\\nduring vietnam, barrow commanded the 9th marine regiment, 3rd\\nmarine division. in operation dewey canyon in early 1969, his\\ntroops killed 1,617 enemy soldiers and captured 1,461 weapons and\\nhundreds of tons of ammunition. gen. richard g. stillwell, chief of\\nstaff to gen. william c. westmoreland, the u.s. american commander\\nin vietnam, called barrow the war\\'s \"finest regimental\\ncommander.\"\\n\\nbarrow rose through the ranks, becoming assistant commandant in\\n1978 and commandant in 1979, succeeding gen. louis h. wilson, who\\nhad already started big reforms in the marines, including\\ndischarging more than 5,000 undesirables.\\n\\nbesides recruitment and training, barrow expanded the marines\\'\\nrole in the military\\'s new rapid response strategy. he also\\nformulated ways the marines could fight without storming beaches.\\nthese included putting equipment on preloaded ships that would meet\\nmarines at a safe port.\\n\\nin 1983, barrow made news after a letter he wrote to the\\nsecretary of defense, caspar w. weinberger, criticizing israeli\\nsoldiers in lebanon, was released by the pentagon. barrow said\\nisraeli soldiers were firing guns at u.s. troops, among other\\nthings. israel denied the charges.\\n\\nbarrow\\'s wife of 53 years, patty, died in 2005. he is survived\\nby his sons charles c. pulliam, of greenville, s.c., and robert h.\\nbarrow, a retired lieutenant colonel in the marines, of tampa; his\\ndaughters cathleen p. harmon, of killeen, texas, barbara b.\\nkanegaye, of houston, and mary b. hannigan, of oakton, va., 11\\ngrandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\\n\\nat his retirement in 1983, barrow recalled asking graduates of\\nparris island boot camp what they had gotten out of their training.\\nhe approvingly quoted one response: \"sir,\" a young marine said,\\n\"the private will always do what needs to be done.\"\\n\\nes\\'kia mphahlele, a south african writer whose 1959 memoir,\\n\"down second avenue,\" vividly dramatized the injustices of\\napartheid and became a landmark work of south african literature,\\ndied monday in lebowakgomo, south africa. he was 88.\\n\\nhis death was reported by raks seakhoa, a friend, the associated\\npress said.\\n\\nalthough mphahlele (pronounced mm-pah-fay-lay) wrote essays,\\nshort stories and novels, he was best known for \"down second\\navenue,\" a searing account of his boyhood and early manhood. its\\ndepiction of traditional rural life, and of violence and oppression\\nin a black township in pretoria, reflected the experience of\\ncountless thousands of his fellow black south africans.\\n\\n\"he was in many ways the father of modern black south african\\nwriting,\" said leon de kock, the head of the school of literature\\nand language studies at the university of the witwatersrand in\\njohannesburg. \"his death closes a certain bracket in our\\nliterature, what we used to call protest literature, literature in\\nthe resistance mode that included exile and return.\"\\n\\nin an essay in the star, a johannesburg newspaper, the\\njournalist and editor barney mthombothi wrote, \"if nelson mandela\\nis our political star, mphahlele was his literary equivalent.\"\\n\\nezekiel mphahlele -- he later africanized his first name -- was\\nborn in marabastad township, pretoria, but spent much of his\\nboyhood in maupaneng, a large village outside pietersburg (now\\npolokwane). at 13, he and his brother and sister returned to\\npretoria, moving in with their maternal grandmother in a house on\\nsecond avenue in a teeming slum neighborhood.\\n\\ncollecting and delivering the laundry that his grandmother\\nwashed for white customers, ezekiel learned his place in south\\nafrican society. at the same time, he excelled in school and\\nattended a progressive secondary school that left him, he later\\nsaid, \"detribalized, westernized, but still african.\" the\\nconflict, both social and artistic, between african and western\\nidentities would become an important theme in his work.\\n\\nafter training as a teacher, mphahlele worked as a secretary at\\na school for the blind and began contributing short stories to\\ndrum, new age and other magazines. in 1945 he married rebecca\\nmochadibane. four of their children survive him: anthony, motswiri,\\nchabi robert and puso.\\n\\nwhile teaching english and afrikaans at a johannesburg high\\nschool, he earned a bachelor of arts and a master of arts in\\nenglish literature from the university of south africa and\\npublished his first book of stories, \"man must live\" (1946). his\\ncareer as an educator came to a sudden halt, however, after he\\npublicly agitated against the discriminatory bantu education act.\\nbarred from teaching in south africa, he struggled to survive and\\nin 1957 emigrated.\\n\\n\"i was suddenly seized by a desire to leave south africa for\\nmore sky to soar,\" he wrote at the end of \"down second avenue.\"\\nhe was, he complained, \"shriveling in the acid of my bitterness.\"\\n\\na wandering life ensued, as he wrote and taught in nigeria,\\nfrance, kenya and zambia. in the early 1970s he taught at the\\nuniversity of denver, where he had earned a doctorate in 1968, and\\nin 1974 accepted a full professorship in the english department of\\nthe university of pennsylvania.\\n\\nwhile in exile he completed his memoir, as well as a second\\nvolume of stories, \"the living and the dead\" (1961), which\\nexplored the intricate, difficult relations between black and white\\nsouth africans. stylistically, the sharp, jabbing prose of his\\nmemoir evolved into the more indirect, often wry voice of the\\nstories in \"in corner b\" (1967).\\n\\nin his first novel, \"the wanderers\" (1971), mphahlele offered\\na sweeping view of african racial problems as seen through the eyes\\nof an exile very much like himself, unable to live in south africa\\nbut ill at ease in freer african states. while in exile, he also\\npublished two well-regarded works of criticism, \"the african\\nimage\" (1962) and \"voices in the whirlwind\" (1972).\\n\\nin 1977 mphahlele surprised friends and family by giving up his\\nuniversity post to return to south africa. \"i couldn\\'t grasp the\\ncultural goals of the americans,\" he told the new york times. \"i\\nfound them so fragmented. i asked myself, \\'what am i contributing\\nto american education?\\' i had no answer.\"\\n\\nat witwatersrand university, where he was the

husband had been waiting for\\ntheir new york state absentee ballots to arrive in india, where she\\nhas been working since the summer. a week ago, they realized that\\neven if the ballots arrived before the election -- a proposition\\nthat was growing more dubious by the minute -- they had almost no\\nchance of getting them back in time to be counted.\\n\\nthey had already called the american consulate, to no avail, and\\nhad looked into hiring a round-trip courier service.\\n\\n\"we had a long talk about it,\" scott-ker said. \"we could go\\non holiday to a beach somewhere. or we could come back here and\\nvote. it was a long talk. we decided it was important to stand up\\nand be counted.\\n\\n\"we bought the tickets that friday, the 24th.\"\\n\\non tuesday evening, she and her husband caught a flight from\\nbangalore to new delhi, about 1,100 miles. the next leg of the\\njourney, 7,500 miles, took them to chicago. by 5:30 on wednesday\\nmorning, they had cleared immigration and customs at o\\'hare\\ninternational airport, and flew the last 700 miles to la guardia.\\ntheir journey of 9,300 miles had taken 22 hours.\\n\\nit is possible for a traveler to go farther in one direction on\\nearth -- but not much. when all their expenses are counted, their\\ntrip will have cost them about $5,000, scott-ker said.\\n\\nexperts say americans are showing more interest and passion\\nabout this election than they have in nearly 50 years. but it is\\nstill likely that one-third of the eligible voters will not take\\npart -- much less spend two full days traveling around the world to\\ndo so.\\n\\nfor scott-ker, 45, a native of new zealand, and her husband, who\\nwas born in morocco, the votes they intend to cast on tuesday in\\nthe washington heights section of manhattan will be their first,\\never. they became american citizens on nov. 30, 2007.\\n\\n\"we became citizens so we could vote,\" scott-ker said. \"we\\'d\\nlived here 13 years on green cards, paid lots of tax money, but you\\nhave no voice within the system.\"\\n\\na few months after they were sworn in as citizens, scott-ker was\\ntransferred to bangalore by her employer, accenture, a management\\nconsulting, technology and outsourcing company, as its marketing\\ndirector for india. she kept her eye on the election, filing the\\nvoter registration forms in august and getting the confirmation in\\nearly october. then she discovered that an absentee ballot would\\nrequire a separate application to the city board of elections.\\n\\n\"in this highly technological age and city, do we need to be\\nmailing applications halfway around the world, just so you can get\\na piece of mail sent back to the same place?\" scott-ker wondered\\naloud.\\n\\nin a word, yes. so, she said, she followed the requirements \"to\\nthe letter. i even provided an addressed envelope for the ballot to\\nbe sent back to us so it would be absolutely perfect, as it would\\nhave to have been for the india postal service.\"\\n\\nstill, no ballots came. the board of elections in manhattan --\\nits funding cut this year in a dispute with the mayor -- has been\\nlaggard in sending out absentee ballots, officials say. scott-ker\\nand her husband, a university instructor, knew nothing of that\\nsquabble.\\n\\n\"we realized we\\'re not going to get to vote, and we were all\\ngeared up to do this,\" she said. \"we thought, maybe a friend\\ncould get the ballots for us in manhattan and have them couriered\\nto india, and we could courier them back. there were so many ifs\\nand buts. i didn\\'t want a bureaucratic process to get in the way of\\ncasting a ballot.\"\\n\\nher determination is clear. even so, was it really necessary to\\ngo to all that trouble to cast votes in new york state, where most\\npolls give the democratic ticket a lead of 30 percent or more?\\n\\n\"then you\\'re relying on other people to do your job,\" she\\nsaid. \"apathy doesn\\'t work in a democracy.\"\\n\\nsoon after she got home, she heard on the news that people in\\nsome states said an incorrect vote was registered when they used a\\ntouch screen in early voting. she fretted that they might lose\\ntheir votes in one final foul-up.\\n\\nnot to worry, she was told, the voting machines in new york have\\nbeen around since at least the early 1960s, and are in no immediate\\ndanger of being transformed into digital touch screens.\\n\\n\"i was looking online,\" she said, \"and as far as i could see,\\nthere\\'s no information about the actual mechanics of voting.\"\\n\\nshe thought for a minute. she and her husband were determined to\\nvote for barack obama and joe biden. \"is there a test we can take\\nbeforehand?\" she asked. \"we don\\'t want to squander our

commission, and\\nthat her group had twice received written confirmation from state\\nofficials that they could receive the applications in albany.\\n\\nin a mass e-mail message sent on friday

wind-swept west texas plains offer an\\nimprobable setting for one of the college football season\\'s most\\nimportant games, as no. 6 texas tech hosts no. 1 texas here on\\nsaturday.\\n\\nand while this dusty city of 217,326 braces for the biggest game\\nin university history, there is a palpable fear here that mike\\nleach, the eccentric offensive guru who built tech into an unlikely\\nnational title contender, may not be around much longer. a local\\nradio station is giving out \"keep mike leach at tech\" shirts this\\nweek, and many worry that this cult hero of a coach could bolt for\\nclemson, washington or one of the many other openings expected in\\nthe off-season.\\n\\none reason for the concern is that leach has just two years\\nremaining on his contract, the shortest length of any coach in the\\nbig 12. leach has gone 73-37 in his nine years here, and with an\\n8-0 record this season, he has secured the program\\'s ninth\\nconsecutive bowl berth. tech\\'s stadium is on the verge of being\\nupgraded for the third time in his tenure, a testament to just how\\npopular he has become.\\n\\ncoaches with that kind of track record typically have at least a\\nfive-year contract cushion. for instance, the contract for oklahoma\\ncoach bob stoops expires in 2013, and mack brown\\'s deal at texas\\nends in 2016. leach\\'s expires in 2010, which opposing coaches can\\nuse against him in recruiting.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t really second-guess it, certainly not during the\\nseason,\" leach said in a telephone interview this week. \"i just\\nroll on and see where it takes you and do the best you can and go\\nfrom there.\"\\n\\nhe is earning $1.75 million this year, meaning he is not among\\nthe five highest-paid coaches in the big 12. while reports in the\\nlocal news media this summer blamed the athletic department\\'s poor\\nfinancial situation for the lack of an extension, gerald myers,\\ntexas tech\\'s athletic director, said that was \"not exactly\\nright.\"\\n\\nin a telephone interview this week, myers said he discussed a\\nnew contract before this season with leach\\'s agent, gary o\\'hagan of\\nimg. myers said he did not talk to leach directly about the\\ncontract but that he could have reached a new deal before this\\nseason. o\\'hagan declined to comment.\\n\\n\"we just made a decision to wait until the season is over,\"\\nmyers said. \"i knew we had a chance to have a really great year\\nand good team. knowing agents, they\\'re just going to want to redo\\neverything again. we want mike to be our coach, and we\\'re going to\\ndo everything we can to make him our coach for a long time. we\\'ll\\njust take care of that when the season\\'s over.\"\\n\\nasked if he was disappointed about his contract situation, leach\\nsaid, \"you always hope for the best you can get, but i try to\\nfocus on the task at hand and just leave all that stuff to the\\npeople that help me out that i hired to do it.\"\\n\\nthe situation has raised eyebrows around college football, where\\nleach is respected for his quirky but effective style. his\\npass-based system has helped turn quarterback graham harrell into a\\nheisman trophy contender. harrell leads the ncaa football bowl\\nsubdivision in passing yards with 3,147. the system also helped\\nmichael crabtree evolve into one of the nation\\'s most productive\\nreceivers. he is tied for first in the fbs with 14 touchdown\\ncatches.\\n\\nby whipping the ball around the field and making defenses dizzy\\nwith his team\\'s aerial antics, leach has thrived in a place with a\\nsmall local recruiting base and little history of top-line football\\nsuccess.\\n\\nthat is why other coaches are puzzled that tech has not bent\\nover backward to keep leach.\\n\\n\"it does surprise me,\" said dennis franchione, the former\\ntexas a&amp;amp;m coach. \"if they\\'re smart, they\\'ll correct that as soon\\nas possible. mike has done a magnificent job there. he\\'s been to\\nbowls every year. he\\'s competed very well at that level. it\\'s hard\\nto win the big 12 south. when you say you\\'re trying to win the big\\n12 south, you\\'re trying to compete for the national championship.\\nthat\\'s what it takes in that division to do that.\"\\n\\nwith a victory over the top-ranked longhorns on saturday, leach\\nwould have tech in position to compete for a spot in the bowl\\nchampionship series title game.\\n\\nconsidering the advantages in financing, recruiting and\\ntradition at big 12 south rivals like texas, oklahoma and texas\\na&amp;amp;m, it would be almost surreal if tech found itself in position to\\npass them and win the division.\\n\\n\"he\\'s probably done more with less than anybody in that\\nconference over the past nine years,\" arizona coach mike stoops,\\nwho worked with leach as an assistant at oklahoma, said in a\\ntelephone interview. \"i think it\\'s a credit to his system and his\\nway of doing things. he\\'s very true to that system and to himself.\\nit\\'s been very successful. by normal standards, you would think the\\nguy can stay as long as he wanted.\"\\n\\nalong with leach being an innovator on the field, few\\npersonalities in college football are as engaging as he is. he is\\none of the few major college coaches in any sport to have a law\\ndegree, and his intellectual fascinations range from south boston\\ngangsters to pirates. of players who entered the tech football\\nprogram out of high school or transferred between 1998 and 2001, 79\\npercent graduated within six years -- the highest percentage in the\\nbig 12, according to the latest ncaa report.\\n\\nalthough leach has long been viewed as a bit of a maverick, he\\nis likely to find his name mentioned at places like tennessee and\\nauburn, where speculation has percolated about the future of their\\ncoaches during seasons of struggle.\\n\\nstill, myers said he remained confident he would reach an\\nextension agreement.\\n\\n\"we\\'re going to get that done,\" he said. \"absolutely.\"\\n\\nhe added: \"there wasn\\'t any question before of whether we\\nwanted mike to be our coach. that wasn\\'t the issue at all. i\\'m not\\ngoing to get into that now. we\\'ve hashed all this, talked about it.\\nmike knows we want him to be our coach. so we\\'re going to move on.\\nwe\\'ll get it done when the season\\'s over.\"\\n\\nasked if he saw himself finishing his career at tech, leach\\nsaid: \"i haven\\'t thought that through exactly, but i\\'m excited\\nabout it now. as far as anything down the road or around the\\ncorner, i\\'ll just have to deal with it then.\"\\n\\nleach\\'s impact on texas tech has been discernibly greater than\\nthat of bob knight, the former indiana basketball coach who\\nstruggled to sell tickets and generate interest during a seven-year\\ntenure on the tech bench. knight abruptly retired last winter,\\nhanding the program to his son pat during the middle of the season.\\n\\nleach\\'s impact has been so great, franchione said, that the\\nuniversity itself \"has grown in stature, and tech football has\\nsomething to do with that growth.\"\\n\\nthat will all be on display when the teams meet this weekend in\\na game featuring a heisman showdown between harrell and texas\\nquarterback colt mccoy.\\n\\nwhether the game lingers as the high point of leach\\'s tenure\\nhere, or is just a milepost in a long career, is likely to be\\ndetermined this off-season.\\n\\nlos angeles - for weeks, mortgage banker ben marsh has been\\nswamped with questions from clients worried about losing their\\nhomes in this bad economy.\\n\\n\"what should i do? what should i do?\" each client typically\\nasked marsh, who has offered up several options, including renting\\nout a room to help cover the mortgage.\\n\\n\"now i\\'m following my own advice. i figure an ounce of\\nprevention is better than a pound of cure.\"\\n\\nmarsh is looking for a roomer to rent a bedroom with plasma tv\\nand stereo surround sound in his spacious three-story home in the\\nhillsides above woodland hills and calabasas; the home includes a\\nbaby grand piano and other musical instruments, a jacuzzi and a\\ngym. all for $1,000 a month.\\n\\n\"times are tough, and i\\'m not closing the 12 to 15 loans a\\nmonth i used to,\" said the single man in his 30s. \"so i figured\\nthat, before things get too bad, i\\'d take some steps to keep them\\nfrom getting bad.\"\\n\\nas the financial crisis worsens, marsh is like more and more\\nmiddle-class homeowners around the country who never thought of\\ntaking in roomers but are now quietly doing so, hoping to use the\\nextra money to help pay mortgages or other debts.\\n\\n\"in this economy, we\\'re now in uncharted waters, and i\\'ve never\\nseen anything like homeowners taking in boarders except in stories\\nabout the depression,\" said bob stern, president of the center of\\ngovernmental studies in los angeles, which examines political and\\neconomic issues in the southland.\\n\\nalthough there are no statistics on how many homeowners are\\nrenting out rooms for the first time, services that place roomers\\nsay that in recent months they have received a rush of calls from\\nthose who had rarely used their services -- middle-class\\nprofessionals living in upscale suburbs.\\n\\n\"we\\'ve seen an upsurge in homeowners renting out rooms in their\\nhomes. it\\'s a sign of the times,\" said mark verge, owner of\\nwestside rentals, which also places roommates.\\n\\n\"i was recently in our valley office, and a 62-year-old woman\\nwalked in looking to share her home with a roommate, and (there\\nwas) another homeowner who said, \\'i\\'ve never done this before, but\\ni\\'m looking to rent out a room in my house to help me with my\\nmortgage.\"\\'\\n\\nverge said that with residential mortgage foreclosures still on\\nthe rise in the u.s., more homeowners nationwide are considering\\nthat same choice.\\n\\nin recent weeks, \"room for rent\" signs have been spotted on\\nthe lawns of some homes in woodland hills. other homeowners have\\nresorted to the internet site craigslist.org to list rooms in their\\nhouses.\\n\\nmarlene mazzi of winnetka said the threat of losing their\\ntwo-story, four-bedroom home is what drove her and husband carlos\\nto list two of the bedrooms with baths for $750 a month each. they\\nhave rented one bedroom and continue looking for a second roomer.\\n\\nmazzi, 48, who operates a home business selling natural and\\norganic products, has mounting medical bills. her husband, a home\\nremodeler, has been out of work because of the downturn in the los\\nangeles home-building industry.\\n\\n\"we need the extra money to help with our house payments,\" she\\nsaid. \"we have our life\\'s savings invested in our home, and we\\nhave to do whatever we can to keep it.\"\\n\\nrenting out part of their home, however, is not without\\nsacrifices for mazzi and her family, who live under the same roof,\\nincluding daughter stephanie, 20, a student at pierce college who\\nhas her own bedroom; and grown nephew paulo taborga, a construction\\nworker who sleeps in a converted family room and also pays a share\\nof the rent.\\n\\n\"we are renting out each bedroom with a bath and we only have\\nthree and a half bathrooms,\" mazzi said. \"so that means that our\\nfamily has to share one full bath.\"\\n\\nrenting out rooms is also a humbling experience for many of\\nthese homeowners, who don\\'t want relatives, friends and neighbors\\nto know they have rented out rooms to strangers or that they have\\nfinancial problems.\\n\\nmany of the homeowners advertising for renters on the internet\\nconfirmed they were taking that step because of the hard times, but\\nmost were reluctant to be identified in this story.\\n\\n\"it was hard enough coming to grips with renting out a room in\\nour home,\" said a northridge homeowner who would only identify\\nhimself as jeff.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think i\\'m ready to announce to the world that i need\\nhelp paying my mortgage.\"\\n\\nothers said they were still dealing with the loss of privacy and\\nsecurity involved in opening up their home to an outsider.\\n\\nbut ultimately there is one unifying, overwhelming incentive:\\nthe hard times.\\n\\ngarrett swayne, a singer-songwriter and music teacher who has\\nowned his three-bedroom home in canoga park since 1988, said having\\nrecently had a friend stay with him for a couple of months had made\\nhis decision easier.\\n\\n\"i\\'m just now, for the first time - and in many ways driven by\\neconomic reasons - realizing that maybe renting a bedroom to\\nsomeone else wouldn\\'t be that bad,\" he said. \"and having another\\n$700 in my pocket isn\\'t going to hurt the bottom line.\"\\n\\nmary wittenberg, the president of the new york road\\nrunners club, recalled friday that it was not easy to accept a\\ntitle sponsor for the new york city marathon in 2003.\\n\\non its own, the marathon\\'s name had become a renowned brand. now\\nit was joining the realm of stadiums, arenas and college bowl games\\nwith corporate names.\\n\\nbut the club needed the money during a soft economy. \"it was a\\nmonumental shift that we weren\\'t looking to make at the time,\"\\nwittenberg said at tavern on the green, two days before sunday\\'s\\nrace. \"we were looking at the time to replace jpmorgan chase at\\nthe very high level of principal sponsor, not to add a title\\nsponsor.\"\\n\\ning, the dutch financial-services giant, agreed to spend an\\nestimated $2 million a year, which has probably increased since, to\\nplace its letters in front of the marathon\\'s name. \"ing came to\\nus,\" she said, \"which put us in a good position to say, here are\\nthe grounds we\\'ll consider a title sponsor. we wanted a real\\npartner and someone who cares a lot about getting kids running, and\\nabout the community.\"\\n\\nthe recent financial crisis weakened ing enough that the dutch\\ngovernment announced sunday that it would provide $13.4 billion to\\nstabilize ing\\'s operations, if not prevent a possible collapse.\\n\\nwittenberg said she was not surprised when she heard of the\\nfinancial rescue.\\n\\n\"we\\'d been in close contact with ing,\" she said. \"we had a\\nvery good sense throughout the crisis that ing was on solid\\nfooting, as we understood it. ing is quite significant in the\\nnetherlands, so we thought the bailout would likely be coming.\"\\n\\ning is not cutting its commitment to the marathon, which goes\\nthrough 2010.\\n\\ntom waldron, an executive vice president for ing americas, said\\nin an interview at tavern on the green: \"we\\'re not letting up. i\\'d\\nbe wondering about people who retreat at a time like this.\"\\n\\nat a news conference a few minutes earlier, he said: \"when ing\\nis involved in something, we\\'re not a drive-by. we\\'re here to\\nstay.\"\\n\\nwaldron\\'s vow to remain -- ing\\'s rights fee is small compared\\nwith its size -- will be worth watching as the effects of the global\\nrecession damage the balance sheets of sports sponsors, who are\\nprominent in the financial and automotive sectors. how many will\\nretain their commitments, reduce or renegotiate them, or simply try\\nto get out?\\n\\nwaldron said the new york city marathon, along with others that\\nit sponsors in the united states and around the world, has helped\\nelevate ing\\'s name into something beyond initials that consumers\\ndon\\'t recognize (or confuse with img, the sports marketer).\\n\\n\"in the united states, running was the great sweet spot\\navailable to us when we entered the market in a big way,\" waldron\\nsaid. \"we see it as a real sweet spot for us. our studies show\\nrunners are more likely to seek financial advisers.\"\\n\\ning, like many sponsors, can\\'t specifically say that the event\\nthey pour money into generates new business or, in its case, new\\naccounts or clients for its banking and financial services. but,\\nwaldron said, ing measures consumer recalls of its name.\\n\\n\"we see an uptick in the recognition of our name after these\\nraces,\" he said.\\n\\nin the world of track and field, the marathon stands out as an\\nevent that unites professionals and amateurs, and is untainted by\\ndrug scandals.\\n\\n\"we\\'re an attractive global brand,\" wittenberg said.\\n\\naccording to federal documents, the club took in $10.8 million\\nin sponsorship and television revenues in the year ended march 31,\\n2007. those were the second-largest sources of revenues for the\\norganization, after $13.1 million in race entries.\\n\\nthe marathon diligently uses the ing name in all public\\nutterances, press releases and signs. the staff knows ing\\'s money\\nhas helped increase overall prize money and the appearance fees\\nthat entice about 40 total elite runners to new york. but the news\\nmedia isn\\'t nearly as dutiful about using the ing name; a nexis\\ndatabase search showed that this year and last, the print media was\\n10 times more likely to leave out the ing name.\\n\\n\"i\\'m very good at calling it the ing new york city marathon,\\nand they\\'ve paid for the name,\" said wittenberg, who was wearing\\nan ing-orange suit. \"i don\\'t need to be reminded.\"\\n\\nin the upper echelon of the southeastern\\nconference, the difference in talent is so slight that games can be\\nwon inside the players\\' helmets as often as inside the hash marks.\\n\\nthat is the defining lesson that georgia coach mark richt says\\nhe learned last season. his bulldogs used a single motivational\\nploy to redefine their image and transform their program into a\\ncontender for the national championship.\\n\\nin a search for more emotion, richt instructed his players\\nbefore their game last year against florida in jacksonville, fla.,\\nto be sure to get a penalty for excess celebration after their\\nfirst touchdown. they ended up being called for two after about 70\\nplayers stormed the field and danced in the end zone.\\n\\ngeorgia went on to a 42-30 victory, suddenly altering a rivalry\\nin which florida had won 15 of the previous 17 meetings.\\n\\non saturday, fifth-ranked florida (6-1, 4-1 sec) plays no. 8\\ngeorgia (7-1, 4-1) in one of the biggest games in the rivalry\\'s\\nhistory, and richt\\'s ploy still dominates the conversation about\\nthe game.\\n\\n\"what the celebration did is it brought a lot of attention to\\nour program,\" the georgia athletic director, damon evans, said.\\n\"it was over all the news and sports networks and radio and things\\nof that nature. it garnered a lot of attention.\"\\n\\nuntil the bulldogs beat florida last year, they had been\\nperpetually on the cusp of the nation\\'s elite. the fact that they\\nalmost never beat florida was one reason they had not cracked\\nthrough to the rarefied air of college football for two decades.\\n\\nbut the intentional and indelible move by richt for the florida\\ngame last year changed the images of richt and georgia. as a\\ncolumnist for the atlanta journal-constitution, mark bradley, wrote\\nthis week, richt\\'s maneuver \"is the single smartest thing he has\\ndone as a coach.\" richt had lost five of his first six games\\nagainst florida.\\n\\nricht and florida coach urban meyer each declined to discuss the\\ncelebration incident. but richt did expound on the lesson of last\\nseason, when georgia finished 11-2 and ranked no. 2. in his words,\\nthe 2007 bulldogs reminded him that \"emotion creates energy.\"\\n\\nricht is often stoic on the sideline, something he said was a\\nbyproduct of his calling plays for years and wanting to keep a\\nlevel head. he gave up those duties toward the end of the 2006\\nseason, and richt said that since then, he had been concentrating\\nmore on gauging his team\\'s emotion.\\n\\n\"i think i\\'ve learned that it\\'s about 50-50,\" he said of the\\nimportance of energy and scheme. \"you better do a good job\\nfundamentally and scheme-wise. but you need to try and find a way\\nto add energy.\"\\n\\nricht acknowledged that it was a bit unlike his usual demeanor\\nto be a rah-rah coach. (he interrupted his briefing with the news\\nmedia tuesday to say \"bless you\" to a reporter who had sneezed.)\\n\\nbut his players point to certain instances, like the occasional\\nuse of georgia\\'s black uniforms, of little changes richt has made\\nto stir their emotions.\\n\\n\"i think it\\'s part of mark growing as a coach,\" evans said of\\nricht\\'s exploration of the psychological part of the game. \"i\\nthink mark has grown every single year as a coach and gotten better\\nand better. we all learn new things.\"\\n\\nin a quiet moment sunday night, meyer would not comment directly\\non georgia\\'s storming the field last year. but he said he had\\ninstructed his team to keep quiet about the celebration because he\\ndid not want it to become a focus of the game.\\n\\n\"i think anything that gets in the way of our preparation would\\nbe a mistake,\" meyer said. \"we don\\'t play the game until\\nsaturday. focus isn\\'t an issue. get it out of your mind. let\\'s not\\nworry about song and dancing. let\\'s worry about blocking and\\ntackling the right people.\"\\n\\nas much as the celebration helped spur georgia to victory last\\nseason, the real reason the bulldogs won is that the gators could\\nnot tackle knowshon moreno, who ran for 188 yards and three\\ntouchdowns on 33 carries. those yards helped more than any\\ncelebration.\\n\\n\"you could probably find enough people to tell you that the\\ncelebration did have some big effect,\" said pat o\\'connor, a\\nprofessor of kinesiology at georgia with a specialty in exercise\\nand sports psychology. \"but there is no scientific evidence to\\nshow that it helped. there\\'s too many variables.\"\\n\\nthe end zone celebration may have motivated georgia, but it also\\ninfuriated the gators. on saturday, the bulldogs may learn if that\\nploy ends up backfiring this year or if they have really leaped\\ninto the national elite.\\n\\nlos angeles - she was a pillar of strength for her

firms are expected to see an uptick\\nin business during the slumping economy -- and many of them have\\ncontributed financially to the yes on measure q campaign.\\n\\nsince early september, the yes on q effort received more than\\n140 contributions totaling more than $700,000. nearly two-thirds of\\nthem came from general contractors, construction, architecture and\\nengineering firms, most of whom do business with the district.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not a surprise at all,\" said bob stern, president of the\\nlos angeles-based center for governmental studies. \"clearly they\\nwill benefit financially.\"\\n\\nlocal developers said the donations don\\'t buy influence with los\\nangeles unified school district officials and see the contributions\\nas support for public education, the local economy and a token of\\nappreciation.\\n\\nmost construction bids with the school district, undertaking the\\nlargest school construction project in the nation, are awarded\\nbased on lowest competitive bids.\\n\\n\"it would be easy to conclude that it helps garner favors, but\\nwhen you look at the mechanics of the bids, there is no\\ndiscretion,\" said steve pellegren, vice president for bernards\\nbrothers inc., one of the largest builders in los angeles.\\n\\nlausd facilities chief guy mehula agreed.\\n\\n\"the los angeles unified school district\\'s contracting process\\nis transparent, fair and open to the public. whether or not a\\ncompany financially contributed to a campaign to support any\\ndistrict bond measure has absolutely no influence on the award of\\ncontracts,\" mehula said.\\n\\nbetween sept. 9 and sept.30, the yes on q campaign received\\n$264,300 in contributions. the largest donations were $25,000 each\\nfrom three separate groups: tarzana-developer sinanian development\\ninc.; the los angeles orange counties building and construction\\ntrades union and hmc group, an ontario-architecture firm.\\n\\nover the summer, sinanian development bid on two new elementary\\nschools in north hills and canoga park as well as sepulveda and\\nsutter middle schools. together, the contracts are worth slightly\\nmore than $50 million. the

tugged jerseys over their chests and\\nwarm-ups over their jerseys. marbury, in his corner locker,\\nremained still, unaffected and undaunted.\\n\\nin another of a seemingly steady progression of separating his\\nknicks from the past regime, coach mike d\\'antoni listed marbury\\namong his inactives before the knicks\\' 116-87 loss to the\\nphiladelphia 76ers on friday night at the wachovia center.\\n\\n\"there were a lot of things that we need to correct and get\\nbetter at,\" d\\'antoni said. \"i thought we were on our heels the\\nwhole game and we didn\\'t do anything real aggressive.\"\\n\\nmarbury is healthy, void of illness and injury. he will not,\\nhowever, be a part of d\\'antoni\\'s rotation now, and probably ever.\\nthat point was hammered in as marbury watched the game from the\\nlast seat on the knicks\\' bench, an easy target to be assailed by\\nthe taunts of fans.\\n\\non the opposite end of the bench, eddy curry sat next to the\\nassistant dan d\\'antoni. curry also did not play for the second\\nconsecutive game, although he was in uniform. marbury and curry\\nwere once viewed as cornerstones of the organization. now, they\\nbookended the team\\'s bench.\\n\\nit is a place they will probably find themselves for the\\nforeseeable future until a resolution can be found. for marbury,\\nthat may come through a buyout, a release, a trade or an expiring\\ncontract that simply cannot expire soon enough.\\n\\nmike d\\'antoni explained that minutes at the guard spots were\\nconsumed by his preferred threesome of jamal crawford, chris duhon\\nand nate robinson. the remaining minutes would be divvied among\\nyoung players, those in the knicks\\' future, those not named\\nmarbury, a lighting rod of controversy in past years.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not that he\\'s done anything,\" d\\'antoni said before the\\ngame, adding that he should have listed marbury as inactive against\\nthe heat in the season opener on wednesday, when marbury dressed\\nbut did not play. \"it\\'s just the team is going in a different\\ndirection. he\\'s been in the league for a long time. i\\'m not going\\nto put him out there for four minutes.\"\\n\\nfriday was the next step in the evolution of marbury\\'s apparent\\nexile. it started subtly enough in july, with the signing of duhon.\\nthen, in training camp, d\\'antoni shuffled marbury from starting\\npoint guard to backup shooting guard, anointing duhon the starter.\\nnext came sporadic minutes in the preseason, followed by\\nwednesday\\'s 48-minute benching.\\n\\nd\\'antoni insisted that the door for marbury is ajar, but it may\\nbe closing shortly. asked what would have to happen for marbury to\\ncrack his rotation, d\\'antoni said: \"injuries. or somebody really\\njust playing bad. but we picked the direction of the club when we\\nsigned duhon, and with jamal and nate, those are the three guys who\\nare going to get the chunk of the minutes.\\n\\n\"the bigger decision, which was mine, was that he didn\\'t have a\\nbig role. at that point, it was now what are we going to do? we had\\nto figure out together. it was my decision on the direction the\\nteam was going to take for the next two or three years.\"\\n\\nthat direction is now all but certain to exclude marbury, who\\ndespite bristling at some questions, continued to publicly put on a\\ngood face.\\n\\nmarbury left the bench to huddle in timeouts and slapped the\\nhands of teammates who departed the game. he reiterated his\\nstatements that he wanted to remain in new york and help the team\\nwin a championship, no matter how far off that might be.\\n\\n\"i\\'m not frustrated at all,\" marbury said. \"i have no control\\nover it. if it was raining outside, i can\\'t get mad if it\\'s\\nraining. i\\'ve got to go get an umbrella and then walk in the rain.\\ni have no control over the situation. the coach makes the decision\\non who plays and who\\'s not going to play, and, obviously, right now\\nhe feels like i\\'m not one of the guys that\\'s going to be playing.\"\\n\\nother questions elicited a simpler response.\\n      is it o.k. with you?\\n      \"coach\\'s decision,\" marbury said.\\n      would you rather sit in clothes than a jersey?\\n      \"coach\\'s decision,\" marbury said.\\n      did you want the chance to talk to d\\'antoni about the decision?\\n      \"coach\\'s decision,\" marbury said.\\n\\nfor all the predictable responses those questions returned, when\\nasked if he wanted to play somewhere else, marbury took a moment to\\nsize up the question, then offered another simple, yet different\\nanswer.\\n\\n\"next question,\" he said.\\n\\nlos angeles - she was a pillar of strength for her church, a\\npowerhouse role

subtle as the sod on the graves that many of the\\nfootball players from aplington-parkersburg high school helped dig\\nfor some of the eight people killed by the tornado. the grass has\\nsown itself back to the earth, like healing scars.\\n\\nthe house of the football coach, ed thomas, at the corner of\\nconn and johnson, has been rebuilt, among the first of the 222\\nhouses destroyed to become a home again.\\n\\nthe rubble that was the high school is gone, replaced by the\\nascending brick walls of next year\\'s classrooms.\\n\\nthe football field, which was speared by debris, is again lush\\ngreen, lined with stripes and mowed perfectly. the mangled signs of\\n205-mph chaos are gone, replaced by new bleachers, light towers,\\ngoal posts and a short chain-link fence behind which restless men\\nand children watch the games. a new scoreboard stands in a corner.\\na rumpled metal piece of the old one, proclaiming this to be\\n\"falcon country,\" hangs as a twisted memorial where the players\\ntake the field.\\n\\n\"you get beat up, battered, but you get back up off the\\nground,\" thomas said.\\n\\nthe falcons, beyond reasonable expectations, are 10-0 and ranked\\nno. 1 in iowa\\'s class 1a, for small schools but not the smallest.\\nthere is no high school here, not anymore and not yet, but there is\\na team. and those who never dreamed of such destruction now imagine\\na recovery that includes a championship.\\n\\naplington-parkersburg opened the state playoffs with a 42-0\\nvictory against st. ansgar on wednesday night at ed thomas field.\\nas people gathered in the chilled twilight before the game, many\\nstopped at the orange construction fence to look at the school\\nbeing resurrected. they saw backhoes and dump trucks. they saw a\\nhorizon filled with houses and businesses in various states of\\nconstruction. when asked about may 25, some of them cried.\\n\\nthen they filled the new bleachers and cheered.\\n\\n\"we\\'re just happy to help out the town,\" said alex hornbuckle,\\na junior running back who scored five touchdowns on wednesday and\\nis one of three 1,000-yard rushers on a team running an old-school\\nwing-t offense. \"whether it\\'s building houses or playing football,\\nwe\\'re just happy to help,\" he said.\\n\\nthe tornado was an ef5 -- the top of the enhanced fujita scale,\\nthe state\\'s strongest in at least a generation -- and it demolished\\ncity hall, the gas station, the grocery store and the high school.\\nit uprooted families and 100-year-old trees. neighbors found one\\ndead woman on her lawn. her husband, with a neck brace, goes to the\\nfootball games, like just about everyone else.\\n\\nfour assistant coaches lost their homes. so did about eight\\nplayers. one lost his grandparents, too.\\n\\nthomas and his wife, jan, emerged from their basement that day\\nto find their possessions scattered over the fields to the east. he\\nwalked to the high school, the first to arrive at the wreckage. he\\nvowed to rebuild the thing he knew best: the football program.\\n\\nthomas has been the coach at aplington-parkersburg -- ap to\\neveryone here -- for 34 years. the falcons won state championships\\nin 1993 and 2001, and four former players are in the nfl: packers\\ndefensive end aaron kampman, lions defensive end jared devries,\\nbroncos center casey wiegmann and jaguars center brad meester.\\n\\nbut the tornado forced the falcons to rebuild, literally. the\\nfirst day, they pulled countless pieces of lumber -- pieces of homes\\n-- that the tornado had thrown into the field like darts. on the day\\nthey played their first home game in september, the scoreboard went\\nup.\\n\\nin between, a temporary locker room was carved from a building\\nconstructed as a bus barn. musco lighting, based in muscatine,\\niowa, donated and installed the lights -- about $150,000 worth,\\nthomas said. turf experts advised thomas on rehabilitating and\\nreseeding the field. a man put in a concrete floor in part of his\\nbarn to create the team\\'s weight room. a new track, replacing the\\none gouged with debris, is nearly complete.\\n\\non wednesday, a school assembly was held at the middle school in\\naplington, where the 240 high school students have squeezed in. in\\nthe hallway was a hand-painted sign: \"we can\\'t be knocked down,\"\\nit read. \"falcon pride is stronger than the ef5.\"\\n\\nthomas accepted a $16,332 check from varsity gold, a fundraising\\ncompany that solicited and matched donations from rival high\\nschools. all told, about $300,000 has been donated, not including\\nthe lights. about $175,000 has come from the nfl\\'s youth football\\nfund, with a matching program for players. the rest has come mostly\\nin small increments.\\n\\n\"sometimes i catch myself thinking, \\'did this really happen to\\nus?\"\\' thomas said.\\n\\nbut thoughts of the \"60 seconds of horror,\" as the high school\\nprincipal, dave meyer, called it, are never far away. the school\\nheld a tornado drill two weeks ago, as iowa requires, though it was\\neuphemistically called a shelter drill. some students needed\\ncounseling, and some were excused from taking part.\\n\\nparents said that many children would not sleep upstairs in\\ntheir bedrooms, away from the relative safety of the basement.\\n\\n\"we still have kids on our football team, if there\\'s bad\\nweather, especially wind, it gets to them,\" thomas said. \"they\\nwant to be home.\"\\n\\nduring the game wednesday, dawn wiegmann, the wife of an\\nassistant coach and mother of a starting safety, recalled the warm\\nafternoon that the family\\'s house was destroyed. her daughter and\\nson coy were in the basement with two of coy\\'s teammates, including\\nhornbuckle. her husband, jon, was not home.\\n\\nas the children screamed at her to get downstairs, she was\\nfrozen by the sight of the approaching black twister. only when the\\n80-year-old tree in the yard was ripped from the ground did she\\nscurry to the basement, under the pool table, with the children.\\n\\nshe remembers the noise -- \"it hurt,\" she said -- and how the\\nback half of the house lifted and fell back on its foundation,\\nthree times, with a bang and a shudder.\\n\\nthe wiegmanns have lived divided since. on sunday, they hope to\\nmove into their rebuilt home, sleeping under the same roof for the\\nfirst time since may.\\n\\nand on monday, they will be back at ed thomas field, where\\naplington-parkersburg plays st. edmond (9-1) from fort dodge.\\n\\nthere are times during practice that thomas senses that his\\nplayers are distracted. he will stop and have them look around, at\\nthe part of town that was wiped away and is being rebuilt. that is\\ntheir motivation.\\n\\nbefore the game on wednesday, thomas paced inside the makeshift\\nlocker room. the players, all 74 of them in uniform, were silent.\\n\\n\"i think you\\'ve understood since day 1 that this wasn\\'t some\\nordinary season,\" thomas said. he reminded the boys of the first\\ngame, on the road, when the visiting bleachers were filled with\\naplington-parkersburg fans an hour before kickoff.\\n\\n\"that\\'s what you guys have meant to this community,\" he said.\\n\"we\\'ve been playing for a lot of people. tonight is no\\ndifferent.\"\\n\\nthe falcons soon ran underneath the battered sign salvaged from\\nthe old scoreboard. the people in the bleachers stood and cheered.\\njust behind them, in the twilight behind the construction fence, a\\nschool was rising again.\\n\\nlos angeles - call it a crosstown showdown, but with cotton\\nswabs instead of footballs and cheek cells instead of the victory\\nbell.\\n\\nstudents at usc and ucla will compete next week to see which\\ncampus can register the most people for the national marrow donor\\nprogram, a registry that connects patients with illnesses to those\\nwilling to donate life-saving bone marrow. results will be posted\\nat bonemarrowchallenge.com.\\n\\nbut organizers hope the rivalry between the two universities\\nwill prove to be more than just a numbers game. the real goal is to\\nfind a match for robert corrales, a santa clarita sheriff\\'s deputy\\nwho was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in april.\\n\\nthe only cure is a bone marrow transplant, but a match with his\\nethnic background has proved elusive among the 11million people in\\nthe registry. even his brothers and sisters didn\\'t match.\\n\\n\"he\\'s unique because of his mixed ethnicity,\" said dr. ronald\\npaquette, corrales\\' physician and a researcher at ucla\\'s jonsson\\ncomprehensive cancer center.\\n\\ncorrales is mexican, but his grandfather on his father\\'s side\\nwas chinese. as it turns out, corrales\\' skin tissue needs to match\\nhis chinese ancestry.\\n\\nthose from multiracial backgrounds \"present unique challenges\\nfor finding an appropriate tissue type,\" paquette said.\\n\\nthe u.s. census has found that up to 11 percent of the\\npopulation in several western states checks more than one race on\\nforms. in hawaii, the most common combination is asian and hawaiian\\nor other pacific islander. in california, it is white and \"other\\nrace,\" and in alaska and oklahoma, it is white and american\\nindian.\\n\\n\"this just goes to show that \\'multiracial america\\' is not a\\nsimple product of urban melting pots but a wide-ranging and far\\nfrom uniform phenomenon,\" a statement on the census web site\\nreads.\\n\\nbut that trend doesn\\'t trickle down to the donor marrow\\nregistry.\\n\\n\"the challenge (for finding a match) is probably greatest in\\nthis growing community of racially and ethnically diverse people,\"\\nsaid dennis confer, chief medical officer for the national marrow\\ndonor program. \"the tissue type is very complex. the chance that\\ntwo people from two different groups will create a new tissue type\\nin children is very high.\"\\n\\nthat\\'s why there is a great need for donors from all\\nbackgrounds, even among whites, because of the many different skin\\ntypes.\\n\\ncorrales and his wife, olga, were on a cruise in mexico when he\\nstarted feeling ill. the ship\\'s doctor deemed him too sick to\\ncontinue traveling.\\n\\nsince then, corrales, 56, the father of four sons, undergoes\\nchemotherapy treatments twice a day and is hospitalized at ucla\\nmedical center-santa monica for weeks because he has no immune\\nsystem.\\n\\n\"we have to stay positive,\" olga corrales said. \"we have our\\nfaith that helps us through everything, and i have to be the\\nadvocate to try to save him.\"\\n\\nbut the desperate need for a bone marrow match touched family\\nfriend nancy ullman, a usc alum who helped set up the crosstown\\nrivalry to register bone marrow.\\n\\n\"for the most part, we knew both campuses had culturally\\ndiverse students,\" she said. \"i\\'m a graduate of usc, and the\\nrivalry is embedded in students. we thought we could generate a\\nlittle bit of buzz, get a lot of kids to register and help them\\nunderstand that marrow has everything to do with race and nothing\\nto do with blood type.\"\\n\\nwhat deters many from registering their donor type are\\nmisconceptions, ullman and others say. to register, all that is\\nneeded is a swab of the inside of the cheek to gather cells.\\n\\nduring the marrow donation, doctors make several small incisions\\nthrough the skin over the back of the pelvic bones, according to\\nthe national donor program registry. they then insert a special\\nhollow needle through these incisions, and a syringe is attached to\\nthe needle to draw out the marrow.\\n\\ncorrales is worth all that, ullman said.\\n\\n\"bob is easygoing, spontaneous, witty and a great\\nstoryteller,\" she said. \"he has a way of making everyone around\\nhim feel important. that\\'s probably why he is fought over by the\\nucla medical center nurses.\\n\\n\"his co-workers love him because he brings them burritos in the\\nmorning stuffed with bacon, eggs and homemade skillet potatoes.\"\\n\\ncorrales, who grew up in the city of san fernando and in\\npacoima, attended college of the canyons in valencia, where he\\nplayed baseball.\\n\\nhe was recruited to play at pepperdine university, but drove a\\nhard bargain and refused to go unless his buddy, steve smith, went\\nwith him.\\n\\nthe school eventually accepted smith, who went on to become the\\nthird-base coach for the 2008 world series champion philadelphia\\nphillies. as for the crosstown showdown, corrales said he is\\nfocusing on the big picture and not on finding a match for himself.\\n\\n\"the chances of a donor coming out of this bone marrow drive\\nare not very good,\" he said from his hospital bed. \"but just to\\nget the people out there to sign up, then hopefully someone can be\\na

cubicles\\ntriggered tunnel vision. he felt alienated from the 18-year-olds\\naround him and their antics. his leg throbbed as he wandered the\\ncampus, trying to remember where to go. his concentration whipsawed\\nand the words he read in textbooks slipped easily from his memory,\\nthe result of a mild traumatic brain injury.\\n\\na charismatic marine corps veteran, blanchard, 25, could trace\\nhis difficulties to iraq and the summer of 2005, when a humvee he\\nwas riding in detonated a bomb buried under the sand. the blast\\nclaimed half his left leg and mangled his right leg. in short\\norder, he endured numerous surgeries, months in a wheelchair, a\\ntitanium prosthesis and intermittent swirls of depression and\\npessimism. until, as he tells it, he woke up one morning and\\ndecided to count his blessings.\\n\\ncollege was the first step in his plan to reshape his life.\\nafter four years in the marines, one combat tour in iraq and a\\nlife-changing injury, how tough could it be?\\n\\n\"i thought, i\\'m so motivated, so intelligent -- i am taking on\\nthe school,\" says blanchard, who now leads efforts at george\\nwashington and nationally to bridge the gulf between combat and\\ncampus. \"it didn\\'t happen that way at all. i was so lost.\"\\n\\nfew students make their way to campus directly from an\\noutpatient bed at walter reed army medical center, as blanchard\\ndid. but with the passage this summer of a new gi bill that offers\\na greatly improved package of education benefits, there will be\\nmore. when the bill goes into effect, in august 2009, a boom in\\npost-9/11 veterans is expected at colleges and universities across\\nthe nation. and unlike the aftermath of the vietnam war, when few\\ncolleges and universities welcomed military veterans, a growing\\nnumber are taking steps to ease the difficult transition.\\n\\nstill in its early stages at many institutions, the effort is\\nled in large part by a generation of student veterans who came to\\nview their own struggles to adapt to academic life as dispiriting\\nand unnecessary.\\n\\n\"some people are talking about it like it\\'s a movement,\" says\\nderek blumke, a university of michigan senior and cofounder and\\npresident of student veterans of america, an advocacy group formed\\nearlier this year. \"a lot of people are returning now and\\nrealizing they want to go to college. they are coming back, getting\\ntogether and wanting to make this happen. people are mobilizing.\"\\n\\nthe legislation fueling the movement pays homage to the original\\ngi bill of rights, which is considered one of the most successful\\nand transformative government programs in history. it ultimately\\nsent 2.2 million veterans to college after world war ii and helped\\nfive million others acquire trade skills. rather than come home to\\nsell apples, as many neglected veterans did after world war i,\\nthese veterans helped broaden the middle class and democratize\\nuniversities, which were primarily bastions of the wealthy and well\\nconnected.\\n\\nfew would argue that the impact of the new gi bill, formally the\\npost-9/11 veterans educational assistance act, will rival that of\\nits prototype, mostly because there are far fewer eligible veterans\\nand the new law is less generous. the original bill paid for\\npublic, private and vocational education. this one covers public\\neducation for most veterans who served after 9/11 and eases the\\nburden of private tuition. the law also extends many benefits to\\nmembers of the national guard and the reserve, and offers stipends\\nfor housing and textbooks. but it does not pay for non-degree\\nvocational training.\\n\\nstill, the law is viewed both by veterans and colleges as an\\nopportunity to do right by today\\'s combat-tested troops and mend a\\nrelationship that has badly frayed since the antiwar movement of\\nthe 1960s. the hope is that new veterans, buffeted by war and a\\ntroubled economy, can seize on college as a roadmap to a productive\\nlife beyond the military.\\n\\n\"this is the biggest step toward turning the page on what we\\ndid after vietnam,\" says paul rieckhoff, executive director of the\\nadvocacy group iraq and afghanistan veterans of america. \"we saw\\nthe gi bill as a way of attempting to deal with veterans\\'\\nreacclimation issues in a more comprehensive way. they are in a\\nsafe place there in school, moving forward with their life.\"\\n\\nrieckhoff\\'s group spearheaded efforts to pass the bill, written\\nby sen. jim webb, a virginia democrat and marine corps veteran. the\\nbill met strong resistance from john mccain, the senator from\\narizona who is now the republican candidate for president, and from\\npresident bush, who argued that it would prompt service members to\\nchoose college over re-enlistment after just three years. but\\nultimately, it passed handily and was signed into law on june 30.\\n\\nof course, veterans have never stopped going to college with\\ngovernment help, even as the country moved to a volunteer military.\\nthe existing law, the montgomery gi bill, was passed in 1984 and\\nwas named after the mississippi congressman who worked to update\\nthe benefits. but, over time, inflation outpaced the payments.\\nveterans, who often enlist on the promise of a college education,\\nfound that the program, in essence, paid for community college.\\nmany have been forced to find full-time jobs to pay their bills.\\n(in august, the benefit was increased by $221, to $1,321 a month.)\\n\\nabout 40 percent of the 450,000 veterans in the current program\\nattend community colleges, about the same percentage that attend\\nfour-year institutions, according to the department of veterans\\naffairs. many do so by choice. two-year colleges offer flexible\\nclass schedules, enroll older students and can feel less\\nintimidating -- all important issues to veterans, who are usually\\nolder and often married with families. online programs are popular\\nfor the same reasons.\\n\\nsome veterans, though, say they wind up in community colleges or\\nfail to transfer to a four-year institution by necessity: the cost\\nis simply prohibitive. the new gi bill will change that.\\n\\nbut money isn\\'t the only hurdle. veterans, for the most part, do\\nnot have an easy time getting into four-year colleges and\\nuniversities, particularly selective private ones. boredom or\\nfrustration with high school -- often accompanied by mediocre\\ntranscripts and sat scores -- led many into the military in the\\nfirst place. but many institutions have failed to make allowances\\nfor the soldiers\\' special circumstances or to promote themselves as\\nveteran-friendly. for veterans, adapting to civilian life, let\\nalone student life, is difficult. it is not uncommon for a new\\nveteran, particularly one with mental or physical injuries, to feel\\noverwhelmed by the choices and rhythms of college.\\n\\nismael valenzuela, 33, hopes one day to study at columbia\\nuniversity.\\n\\nreared in el paso, texas, he did a lackluster stint at a\\ncommunity college, then in 1997 moved to new york to study\\nclassical guitar at the new school. despite his passion, he didn\\'t\\nfeel ready to get serious. \"a big piece of the puzzle was still\\nmissing,\" he says.\\n\\na patriot, he had long imagined himself in the military. so in\\n2000, valenzuela enlisted in the marine corps. twice he was\\ndeployed to iraq, the first time at the start of the war. the\\nsecond tour, with the country in the throes of an insurgency, was\\nmuch rougher. days were filled with seek-and-destroy missions and\\nsearching houses for weapons caches. a buddy died in combat.\\nexplosions and small arms fire were a constant hazard.\\n\\nlast year he decided to leave the corps, a tough decision. he\\ntraveled through europe for a while and came home ready for\\ncollege. but he had missed the application deadline for borough of\\nmanhattan community college. he was told to reapply later in the\\nyear.\\n\\nfearing that if he did not begin school right away he would\\nstart a downward drift, valenzuela asked to speak to the director\\nof admissions. at first the director, eugenio barrios, saw in him\\njust another case of procrastination and immaturity. but valenzuela\\nbrought up his seven-year career in the corps, and showed pictures\\nof a banged-up humvee in iraq. the vehicle had flipped in an\\naccident, a common danger, and valenzuela had been knocked\\nunconscious for 10 minutes. he had shaken off the daze and gone\\nright back to work.\\n\\nthe two men shared a rapport, and barrios agreed to become the\\nveteran\\'s mentor.\\n\\nvalenzuela did not do so well on the placement exam in reading,\\nwriting and math required by the city university of new york. that\\ndid not surprise him, because the day of the test he had trouble\\nfocusing and remembering facts, perhaps a product of both\\npost-traumatic stress disorder and a mild traumatic brain injury.\\n\\nbarrios was quick to tell him that to succeed he would need to\\napply everything he learned in the corps to his schoolwork.\\n\\n\"some need more help than others because their academic\\nbeginnings were not as strong,\" barrios says of veterans. \"they\\nbring a certain level of maturity and a certain appreciation of our\\nsystem. their desire is there. there is a word in spanish for that:\\nlas ganas. they have that very strong will to want to succeed.\"\\n\\nvalenzuela\\'s return from war has not been entirely smooth or\\nentirely unusual. in the months after he left the corps, he became\\neasily enraged, got into fights and drank two 12-packs of heineken\\na night, he says. he felt adrift and apathetic. that slowly began\\nto change after he started college, in january. with the help of\\nhis psychiatrist at the department of veterans affairs, his new\\ngirlfriend and barrios, he has wrestled down some of his mental\\nhealth problems. talking about the war was the first step in a long\\nprocess.\\n\\n\"i have gotten a lot better,\" he says. \"i have been pampered\\nright now by the v.a. and the school. they have been perfect, more\\nthan perfect.\"\\n\\nacademically, he has struggled. he studies three times as hard\\nas many other students, he says, but makes progress every day. he\\nis passing all his classes this term, though he failed math over\\nthe summer. his goal is to study astronomy and engineering, then\\nreturn to the marine corps as a pilot.\\n\\n\"i can see why it would be hard to follow through,\" says\\nvalenzuela, an unyielding optimist now. \"i don\\'t know how many\\ntimes i just want to throw the books. but i am super-motivated.\\nthat is one of the things keeping me sane.\"\\n\\nstill, old habits die hard, even in the classroom.\\n\\n\"i always know where the exit is, how many windows there are\\nand,\" he says with a smile, \"what\\'s the weapon of choice.\"\\n\\nshortly after valenzuela first showed up for class at the\\ncommunity college\\'s lower manhattan complex, aubrey arcangel sought\\nhim out. arcangel is president of the student veterans club, and he\\nwanted to make sure valenzuela was doing all right. it was a\\nprotective gesture not so very different from the code the military\\nlives by.\\n\\nnew veterans step into college life from a highly structured\\nsystem and are bedeviled by the looseness they find. how to start a\\nday without a schedule, one that usually begins with physical\\ntraining? arcangel, 26, who left the army after four years and one\\ntour in iraq, explains: \"you have p.t. formation, then you have\\np.t., then you have another formation and blah blah blah. there is\\na procedure for everything, a field manual, a technical manual for\\neverything.\"\\n\\nthen there are the other students, many of whom arrive right\\nfrom high school. by and large, fellow students have welcomed\\nveterans, although they do sometimes display a morbid -- some former\\nmarines say inappropriate -- curiosity about life on the ground in\\niraq. the discomfort many veterans mention has less to do with any\\nantiwar attitudes than with the students\\' maturity level and remove\\nfrom the war. with fewer than 2.7 million in the armed forces --\\nroughly 2 percent of americans 18 to 49 -- young people know little\\nabout the military, how it works and what it is like to fight in a\\nwar.\\n\\nfor arcangel, iraq, where he provided security for a lieutenant\\ncolonel, has been difficult to shake off. \"if i were back there, i\\nthink i would go insane,\" he says. \"it seemed almost surreal.\"\\n\\nthat is one reason he became a student leader, working to hook\\nveterans up with one another in a social network. \"there are some\\nveterans that are socially awkward and this helps,\" he says. at\\nborough of manhattan community college, fewer than 1 percent of\\nenrolled students are veterans -- 160 of more than 19,000 students.\\n\\nchanneling the warrior mentality into textbooks and tests can be\\nespecially trying for combat veterans.\\n\\njohn schupp, a chemistry professor at cleveland state\\nuniversity, which has about 340 former servicemen and women among\\nits 15,000 students, saw the difficulties firsthand and sold his\\nuniversity on the idea of vets-only courses. fall semester,\\nfirst-year vets can take four introductory courses -- english, math,\\nbiology and \"introduction to college life\" -- and in the spring,\\npsychology, chemistry, sociology and one course in the mainstream\\nto ease them into the civilian world.\\n\\n\"i had to recruit students from the community to get enough in\\nthe spring,\" he says. \"they didn\\'t just show up on campus. i\\nreached out to the military mom groups. i met with them on a weekly\\nbasis.\" last semester, the program\\'s first, he recruited 14\\nfreshmen. \"once i got the first 14, they were spokespersons.\"\\nthis semester there are 25 new students in the program.\\n\\nschupp sees camaraderie in the classroom as crucial to getting\\nthe veterans to show up, to stay and to thrive. \"they tell me over\\nand over they wouldn\\'t have come to college otherwise,\" he says.\\n\"in the military world it\\'s the team. the squadron must survive.\\nwhen you come to school it\\'s all personal -- my books, my grade, my\\nstuff, my notes. they\\'re isolated, because other students haven\\'t\\nseen what they\\'ve seen.\"\\n\\nthe university of california, berkeley, a hotbed of antiwar\\nprotest during the vietnam war, offers a class called \"veterans in\\nhigher education,\" to help them learn how to prepare for tests and\\nmaximize study time. the class is part of troops to college, an\\ninitiative begun in 2006 and championed by gov. arnold\\nschwarzenegger to attract veterans to california state colleges and\\nuniversities and make them feel at home on campus.\\n\\nand at the university of michigan, with 90 students receiving gi\\nbenefits, a veterans services office has been set up to help with\\npaperwork and particulars of the gi bill, to walk new students\\nthrough course registration and to help them find housing. such\\noffices can assist members of the service or veterans in gathering\\nlost transcripts before they apply, something not easily done from\\niraq, or see to it that veterans have access to counseling, in some\\ncases without having to wait in a roomful of other students.\\nveterans suffering from combat stress don\\'t always cope well with\\ncrowded rooms.\\n\\ndespite the steps to attract these students, blumke of the\\nstudent veterans of america says many in the military view the best\\nuniversities as off limits, even for the academically qualified.\\n\\nblumke, 27, had a grade point average of 1.5 when he graduated\\nfrom high school in alanson, mich. the 3.9 gpa he earned in a\\ncommunity college and, he believes, his standing in the military\\ngot him into the university of michigan last year. (michigan state\\nuniversity rejected him.) he is double-majoring in psychology and\\npolitical science.\\n\\nhis friends thought he was overshooting when he applied.\\n\"veterans for far too long have been pigeonholed\" as only\\ncommunity college material, says blumke, a former noncommissioned\\nofficer in the air force. \"the michigans, uclas and dartmouths --\\nthere is a social stigma attached to those schools. when i told my\\nfriends i was going to u. of m., they couldn\\'t believe it, because\\nof the liberal ideas that they don\\'t like the military there. they\\nwere stuck in the \\'60s and \\'70s.\"\\n\\nuntil recently, universities made little effort to recruit\\nveterans or to alter the misgivings that blumke expressed.\\n\\njim selbe, the assistant vice president for lifelong learning\\nfor the american council on education, which represents 1,600\\ncolleges and universities, says that just two years ago \"a\\nsignificant gap\" existed \"between rhetoric and practice.\"\\n\\n\"the gap is beginning to steadily diminish,\" he says. \"there\\nis a deep sense of obligation to do what\\'s necessary to provide an\\nopportunity for returning veterans.\"\\n\\nlast year, the council started a program to provide\\nindividualized college counseling to seriously injured veterans at\\nmilitary hospitals. the program was the brainchild of james wright,\\nthe president of dartmouth, who has led efforts to bring more\\nveterans to college.\\n\\n\"the all-volunteer military draws in a segment of the\\npopulation that has not customarily gone to college in the same\\nproportion as other parts of our society,\" says wright, a former\\nmarine. he hopes the new gi bill \"will cause them to raise their\\naspirations.\"\\n\\ndartmouth\\'s admissions office takes military experience into\\naccount, wright says. he advises veterans to bring their service\\nrecord to the institution\\'s attention, perhaps through the essay\\nrequirement. discipline, as well as job and leadership qualities,\\nbrings something to the table that cannot be matched by young\\nstudents. yet there has to be a sense that the veteran can cope\\nwith the demands of the courses. \"we don\\'t look for the same thing\\nin terms of test scores, but we are not doing them any favors,\"\\nwright emphasizes. \"we want to make sure they are prepared and\\nwould succeed.\"\\n\\nthe number of recent veterans attending dartmouth is tiny, all\\nmatriculating in the last two years. last year, two became\\nfreshmen; this fall there are six in a first-year class of 1,077.\\n\\nblumke recognizes the uphill struggle and has refined his\\norganization\\'s pitch, which he delivers repeatedly to colleges and\\nuniversities: \"war is not glamorous, but it is reality. we bring\\nthat experience to people who don\\'t know about it.\"\\n\\nthat experience ultimately got james mcmahon, who served four\\nyears in the marines, into the college of his choice. mcmahon, 23,\\nhad nearly given up on attending the university of rhode island,\\nhis home state school. the admissions office looked at\\nfive-year-old sat scores and poor high school grades (\"i didn\\'t\\nhave a vested interest in college\") and was unimpressed. he was\\nrejected.\\n\\nmcmahon was in california training other marines for deployment\\nto iraq, so his father and girlfriend took up the battle, calling\\nthe admissions office and sending letters that underscored his\\nsuccesses.\\n\\n\"my father finally got in touch with the president of the\\nuniversity and with his typical irish charm said, \\'something might\\nbe wrong with the computer system. i\\'m sure it\\'s nobody\\'s fault.\\nbut did you just deny a combat veteran with all this experience and\\na guaranteed $40,000 if he comes to your school?\\' \" two weeks\\nlater, an acceptance letter arrived.\\n\\nadmissions offices, mcmahon says, \"are just not wired to think\\nabout it in those terms. i didn\\'t take it as a personal insult. i\\nwas more laughing at the university. my friends from high school,\\nthey have bachelor degrees from there and these are the same kids i\\nwas getting into trouble with four or five years ago.\"\\n\\nan artilleryman, mcmahon is being tested for a mild traumatic\\nbrain injury. he recently cut back on his classes, saying that the\\ninjury was making it hard to keep up. but he is majoring in\\nsociology with a focus on criminal justice and has a 3.24 average.\\n\\nlike his fellow veterans, blanchard is determined not to let his\\ninjuries dictate his future. following in his father\\'s footsteps,\\nhe joined the marine corps right out of high school, in 2001.\\n\\nhis specialty was combat engineering, because \"i wanted to blow\\nstuff up,\" he says.\\n\\nin 2005, he was deployed to iraq near the syrian border, where\\nhe went on patrols and blew up gates and doors so buildings could\\nbe searched. six months later his humvee hit the roadside bomb that\\ntook half his leg.\\n\\nafter his roommate at walter reed was accepted by georgetown\\nuniversity, blanchard decided to aim high himself and apply to\\ngeorge washington university, which has about 300 veterans who\\nreceive benefits and 200 who do not, a university spokeswoman says.\\n\\nthe two veterans moved into an apartment in virginia together,\\nand blanchard started his first year.\\n\\nbut he didn\\'t count on his brain playing tricks on him. although\\ndoctors had diagnosed mild traumatic brain injury, he shrugged it\\noff. compared with losing half a leg and nearly losing his other\\nleg, a slightly shaken-up brain did not register as a concern.\\n\\n\"whatever,\" blanchard thought to himself.\\n\\ntwo days into classes, though, he noticed that he was retaining\\nlittle of what he read or heard in the classroom. \"my mind was\\nblurred, cloudy all the time, and i was walking around in a daze,\"\\nsays blanchard, who does not advertise his injuries because he\\nwants no special treatment. \"i had a full load and i dropped all\\nmy classes except two. and yet i\\'m studying all the time. it was so\\nfrustrating.\"\\n\\nover time, his brain learned to compensate. \"i just started to\\nremember better, adjusting how i think,\" says blanchard, now a\\njunior studying international business. \"it\\'s still very hard.\\nwith classes like regression analysis, i\\'ll never be the same\\nagain,\" he says, jokingly.\\n\\nalthough his good leg hurts all the time, he refrains from\\ntaking pain medication whenever he can. instead, he works out at\\nthe gym and allows his endorphins to lessen his discomfort, reduce\\nhis anxiety and help him concentrate.\\n\\nhe also started a student veterans group, which has put him in\\ntouch with about 20 other veterans and has greatly diminished his\\nsense of isolation.\\n\\nthis semester, his grades are average and he is taking a full\\nload of courses, along with added responsibilities as vice\\npresident of student veterans of america. he ran on a whim in the\\nspring and was voted in. he is setting up a database of services\\nfor veterans and working on plans to take his fellow veterans to\\nwalter reed to help -- and urge -- wounded service members to go to\\ncollege. he hopes to collaborate with the university\\'s hospital on\\ntreating student veterans for combat-related problems.\\n\\nlooking back, he says, it was his injury and the discipline he\\nlearned as a marine that pushed him toward college, a first for his\\nfamily.\\n\\nnow that he is here, courtesy of the government, he is not about\\nto squander the opportunity.\\n\\n\"i went through hell and my body shows it,\" blanchard says.\\n\"but i said this is going to be a blessing. i didn\\'t know how, i\\njust knew it would.\"\\n\\nfor weeks, mortgage banker ben marsh has been\\nswamped with questions from clients worried about losing their\\nhomes in this bad economy.\\n\\n\"what should i do? what should i do?\" they have asked marsh,\\nwho has offered up several options, including renting out a room to\\nhelp cover the mortgage.\\n\\n\"now i\\'m following my own advice. i figure an ounce of\\nprevention is better than a pound of cure.\"\\n\\nmarsh is looking for a boarder to rent a bedroom that has a\\nplasma tv and stereo surround sound in his spacious three-story\\nhome in the

financial crisis worsens, marsh is like more and more\\nmiddle-class homeowners around the country who never thought of\\ntaking in boarders but are now quietly doing so, hoping to use the\\nextra money to help pay mortgages or other debts.\\n\\n\"in this economy, we\\'re now in uncharted waters, and i\\'ve never\\nseen anything like homeowners taking in boarders except in stories\\nabout the depression,\" said bob stern, president of the center of\\ngovernmental studies in los angeles, which examines political and\\neconomic issues in the southland.\\n\\nalthough there are no statistics on how many homeowners are\\nrenting out rooms for the first time, services that place boarders\\nsay that in recent months they have received a rush of calls from\\nthose who had rarely used their

foreclosures still on\\nthe rise in the u.s., more homeowners nationwide are considering\\nthat same choice.\\n\\nin recent weeks, \"room for rent\" signs have been spotted on\\nthe lawns of some

their\\ntwo-story, four-bedroom home is what drove her and husband carlos\\nto list two of the bedrooms with baths for $750 a month each. they\\nhave rented one bedroom and continue looking for a second boarder.\\n\\nmazzi, 48, who operates a home business selling natural and\\norganic products, has mounting medical bills. her husband, a home\\nremodeler, has been out of work because of the downturn in the los\\nangeles home-building industry.\\n\\n\"we need the extra money to help with our house payments,\" she\\nsaid. \"we have our life\\'s savings invested in our home, and we\\nhave to do whatever we can to keep it.\"\\n\\nrenting out part of their home, however, is not without\\nsacrifices for mazzi and her family, who live under the same roof,\\nincluding daughter stephanie, 20, a student at pierce college who\\nhas her own bedroom; and grown nephew paulo taborga, a construction\\nworker who sleeps in a converted family room and also pays a share\\nof the rent.\\n\\n\"we are renting out each bedroom with a bath and we only have\\nthree and a half bathrooms,\" mazzi said. \"so that means that our\\nfamily has to share one full bath.\"\\n\\nrenting out rooms is also a humbling experience for many of\\nthese homeowners, who don\\'t want relatives, friends and neighbors\\nto know they have rented out rooms to strangers or that they have\\nfinancial problems.\\n\\nmany of the homeowners advertising for boarders on the internet\\nconfirmed they were taking that step because of the hard times\\ntoday, but most were reluctant to be identified in this story.\\n\\n\"it was hard enough coming to grips with renting out a room in\\nour home,\" said a northridge homeowner who would only identify\\nhimself as jeff.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think i\\'m ready to announce to the world that i need\\nhelp paying my mortgage.\"\\n\\nothers said they were still dealing with the loss of privacy and\\nsecurity involved in opening up their home to an

cut\\nthrough the weighty economic theories concerning this latest\\ndownturn and borrowed a simple message from the beatles. \"help!\"\\nmayor douglas palmer pleaded. like mayors and governors across the\\ncountry, palmer asked congress to funnel money to city and state\\ngovernments where tax revenues are plummeting and requests for aid\\nare soaring.\\n\\nthe national conference of state legislatures has begun\\nappealing for congressional help with the \"precarious\" financial\\nstatus of many states. unlike the federal government, most states\\nand cities require balanced budgets, and the conference has\\nestimated a $26 billion shortfall for 27 states so far this year.\\nif the economy continues its slide, that figure is surely to grow,\\nwith some estimates rising to $100 billion by the next fiscal year.\\n\\ncalifornia is facing a $3 billion shortfall this year. new\\njersey has $400 million less than needed for a $33 billion budget.\\ngov. david paterson of new york, whose wall street tax revenues are\\nevaporating, has estimated a record $47 billion budget deficit over\\nthe next four years. and new york city\\'s mayor, michael bloomberg,\\nwho also sees his revenues shrinking precipitously, has called on\\nwashington for a \"new new deal.\"\\n\\nif congress and the white house can bail out bankers and\\ninsurance companies and possibly the auto industry, they should be\\nable to help state and local governments, too. the aid could be\\ntemporary, the way it has been during past recessions. and it\\nshould come after cities and states have downsized to the\\nessentials.\\n\\nin addition to extending unemployment benefits and food stamp\\nprograms, which provide the biggest immediate boosts to states\\'\\neconomies, one promising idea being pushed by governors is to put\\nmore federal money into projects like roads, subways, bridges,\\ntunnels, schools and sewage plants. this help should go where work\\nalready has started or can begin almost immediately. transit\\nexperts told congress recently that they have at least $26 billion\\nworth of projects that would be ready to go in 90 days. all they\\nneed is the money.\\n\\ngov. jon corzine of new jersey reminded the house committee on\\ntransportation and infrastructure this week that federal support of\\nthis kind would \"put people to work.\" he estimated that each $1\\nbillion for public works would create 35,000 jobs. at the same\\ntime, congress and the white house would be helping to stem the\\nrapid deterioration of the nation\\'s infrastructure.\\n\\nmany states also need added support for medicaid. during the\\nlast recession in 2001, congress provided states an extra $10\\nbillion in block grants and another $10 billion to help temporarily\\nwith medicaid. the program could use longer-range fixes, of course,\\nbut emergency funding for at least two years would certainly help\\nprotect the nation\\'s most vulnerable.\\n\\ninvesting in highways and health care is a far more effective\\nway of stimulating the economy than repeating the mistake of\\nsending rebate checks to a broad array of individual taxpayers.\\nmost americans used those federal bonuses to fill the gas tank, a\\nfleeting assist to family budgets, but a big boon for the oil\\ncompanies. with their record profits, the oil companies are the\\nlast ones the government should be helping at this point. and\\nstates won\\'t use federal funds for executive bonuses or corporate\\njunkets, the way some financial firms have.\\n\\ngiving money to state and local governments has its hazards, of\\ncourse. congress must resist making this next stimulus into an ugly\\nporkfest, with money for everybody\\'s favorite waterworks. and it\\ncannot become an excuse for governors and mayors to avoid making\\nhard decisions about how to cut their own budgets.\\n\\nbut it is time for congress and the white house to recognize how\\ncrucial it is to help local governments who provide services like\\nschools and health care and police protection that cannot fall\\nvictim to this latest recession.\\n\\nanother thumb on the scales\\n\\nthe world is in economic turmoil -- much of it caused by american\\nfinancial excesses -- but the bush administration isn\\'t budging from\\nits anti-regulatory, unfettered-markets-know-best convictions.\\n\\nthe justice department\\'s antitrust division has published a new\\nset of guidelines that narrow the interpretation of abuse that\\nwould justify government intervention against monopolies. it is a\\nderegulatory gift aimed at getting pesky antitrust enforcers off of\\nthe back of big business.\\n\\nthe new doctrine bends over backward to protect big firms from\\naccusations of anticompetitive behavior. it requires proof that the\\nharm done by a monopolist\\'s actions -- say, bundling new\\napplications into a computer operating system to keep rival\\nsoftware makers out -- be \"disproportionately\" greater than the\\npotential gains to consumers.\\n\\nif a dominant firm made an exclusive deal with a distributor to\\nlock out a competitor, it would be illegal only if the competitor\\nwere denied access to least 30 percent of the market. if a dominant\\ncompany used discounts as a tactic to smother competition, it could\\nget off the hook if it let its smaller competitor survive, even if\\nonly barely. \"rivals\\' continued presence in the market casts\\nserious doubt on the existence of anticompetitive effects,\" the\\nreport says.\\n\\nthe department of justice\\'s antitrust division is supposed to be\\nthe agency looking out for the interests of american consumers, not\\nbig companies -- a role it has clearly forgotten over the last eight\\nyears. throughout the entire bush administration, it has not\\nbrought a single case against a dominant firm for anticompetitive\\nbehavior. and it has argued enthusiastically on behalf of\\nmonopolists before the supreme court.\\n\\nover the last decade and a half, the court also has bought into\\nthe creed that unregulated markets self-correct, and it has become\\nextremely wary of government intervention against monopolistic\\nfirms.\\n\\nbut even the federal trade commission declined to support the\\njustice department\\'s new guidelines. chairman william kovacic, a\\nrepublican, said he doubted that big companies needed more\\nprotection from regulators. the three other commissioners -- a\\ndemocrat, a republican and an independent -- said the report placed\\n\"a thumb on the scales in favor of firms with monopoly or\\nnear-monopoly power and against other equally significant\\nstakeholders.\"\\n\\nfortunately, the next administration can ignore this report. it\\nshould. the lesson of the last eight years is that unfettered\\nmarkets don\\'t always know best. government regulation must play a\\ncrucial part to ensure that fair competition prevails.\\n\\na flawed assessment of bpa\\n\\nafter reports of a possible conflict of interest, we worried\\nthat a scientific advisory panel might pull its punches in\\nevaluating the food and drug administration\\'s judgments on the\\nsafety of bisphenol-a, known as bpa. it didn\\'t.\\n\\nin a devastating new report, the panel charged that a draft\\nsafety assessment prepared by the fda ignored relevant studies,\\nused flawed methodology and created \"a false sense of security\"\\nabout the safety of bpa, which is found in baby bottles, plastic\\nwater bottles and the liners of cans, among other products.\\n\\nthe draft assessment had concluded that the small amounts of bpa\\nthat leach into milk or food are not dangerous. the advisory panel\\ndid not directly dispute this. but it left little doubt that the\\nweight of the evidence, in its view, suggests the need for a much\\ngreater safety margin than the fda draft deemed adequate.\\n\\nthe u.s. national toxicology program -- which considered many of\\nthe studies the fda had discounted -- has expressed some concern\\nabout bpa\\'s safety, and canada has moved toward banning the sale of\\nbaby bottles made with bpa. some research suggests that bpa might\\ncause neurological damage, accelerate puberty, interfere with\\nchemotherapy and increase the risk for heart disease, diabetes and\\ncancer.\\n\\nthe fda\\'s science board, an advisory group, endorsed the panel\\'s\\ncritique on friday. now it is imperative that the fda complete a\\nmore rigorous assessment. it must also consider whether to restrict\\nsome uses of bpa without waiting for further research.\\n\\nshepard the anchor\\n\\nwe do not often cheer on fox news\\'s coverage of politics. but we\\ndid the other day when the anchor shepard smith reported on an\\nespecially absurd turn in the \"joe the plumber\" saga.\\n\\njohn mccain\\'s reference at the last presidential debate to\\nsamuel j. wurzelbacher, the ohio plumber who worriedly asked barack\\nobama about taxes, was a predictable campaign stunt. it ought to\\nhave lasted for half a news cycle, especially after it became clear\\nthat wurzelbacher\\'s taxes would go down under obama\\'s plan. but the\\nrepublican

conferences. he was interviewed on\\nthe \"cbs evening news,\" where he compared obama to sammy davis\\njr. according to politico.com, he has an agent and is exploring \"a\\npossible record deal with a major label, personal appearances and\\ncorporate sponsorships.\"\\n\\nat a campaign rally this week, wurzelbacher was filmed agreeing\\nwith another mccain supporter that electing obama would be \"death\\nto israel.\"\\n\\nfor five, painful, live-on-fox minutes the next day, smith\\nrepeatedly asked wurzelbacher what evidence he had to back up that\\ncharge. wurzelbacher refused to answer. he said it was up to\\nsmith\\'s viewers to figure out why he, joe the plumber, thought\\nobama was a menace to israel.\\n\\nlooking incredulous, smith gave up. he read a statement from the\\nmccain campaign praising the plumber\\'s \"penetrating and clear\\nanalysis.\"\\n\\nthen smith said: \"i just want to make this 100 percent\\nperfectly clear. barack obama has said repeatedly and

have to get\\nrid of \"all that indian stuff.\"\\n\\ni hope that agent found work in another field. hillerman, who\\ndied last week ((10/26)) at 83 at his home in albuquerque, wrote 18\\nnovels about all that indian stuff that have sold millions of\\ncopies around the world, made him a beloved figure among american\\nindians and non-indians alike, and brought countless readers to the\\nsouthwest to experience the harshly beautiful land he wrote about\\nwith such lyrical passion.\\n\\ni\\'ve long been among his fans. i lived in the southwest for 10\\nyears, and when i\\'m missing it, a rereading of any of his 18\\nmysteries featuring navajo tribal police officers joe leaphorn and\\njim chee is enough to take me there for a while.\\n\\nwhile i was a book editor in tucson, ariz., i was lucky enough\\nto meet hillerman a few times, and he entirely lived up to his\\nreputation as a gentleman, supportive of other writers,\\nunpretentious about his own success  and expert in all things\\nrelated to the southwest\\'s native people.\\n\\nat a book signing, he caught sight of my husband\\'s silver belt\\nbuckle from across the bookstore. \"hopi?\" he asked, guessing\\ncorrectly the origin of the design of trickster god kokopelli among\\ncornstalks. \"nice piece,\" he said with a nod.\\n\\nhillerman\\'s knowledge about the native people of the southwest\\nwas both scholarly and personal; he researched their cultures and\\nhistories, but he also knew them as individuals. he wrote about\\nmany of the tribes that live in the four corners area (where new\\nmexico, arizona, colorado and utah meet), but his focus was the\\nnavajo, or dineh, people.\\n\\nthe navajo nation is the largest indian tribe in the united\\nstates, with almost 300,000 members. about 180,000 of them live in\\nthe tribal homeland, which covers about 27,000 square miles in\\narizona, utah and new mexico.\\n\\nhillerman set the leaphorn and chee novels there, where among\\nthe mesas and canyons you can see the ancient bones of the earth\\nand where, in the mcdonald\\'s in the town of window rock, ariz., you\\ncan get free wifi. his characters\\' lives reflect the constant\\ninterplay between traditional navajo ways  the ideal of harmony, or\\n\"walking in beauty\" with everything around you  and the intrusion\\nof the modern world.\\n\\nalthough he was not an indian, hillerman came by his knowledge\\nand understanding of the indian people through long experience. he\\nwas born in the indian territory, in sacred heart, okla., founded\\nas a mission on the potawatomi reservation, and attended indian\\nschools.\\n\\nhillerman quit college to fight in world war ii, returning with\\na purple heart and severe injuries. after finishing college, he\\nworked for more than 30 years as a journalist and as a journalism\\nprofessor and department chairman at the university of new mexico,\\nretiring in 1987.\\n\\nhe was in his 40s when he wrote his first novel, and,\\nfortunately for readers, he ignored that agent\\'s advice. his first\\nfour novels centered on lt. joe leaphorn, a no-nonsense rationalist\\nwith a master\\'s degree in anthropology and a cynical view of what\\nhe considers navajo superstitions.\\n\\nfrom the first, in the blessing way, hillerman skillfully\\ninterwove fascinating navajo folklore with classic crime stories\\nand created lively, complex characters.\\n\\nin his fifth novel, people of darkness (1980), hillerman\\nintroduced a counterpoint to leaphorn. sgt. jim chee is younger,\\nmuch more traditional and something of a mystic  he is undergoing\\nthe long study required to become a hataalii, or singer-shaman.\\n\\nhillerman featured leaphorn and chee separately in some novels\\nand in others brought them together on cases. readers love them so\\nmuch, and feel them to be so real, that they have been known to\\nshow up at tribal police offices asking for them.\\n\\nthe author tried several times to end the series, but readers\\nwouldn\\'t have it. his last published novel, the shape shifter in\\n2006, featured both leaphorn and chee in a mystery that links a\\nmissing navajo rug and the aftershocks of the vietnam war.\\n\\nhillerman received many honors over the course of his career,\\nincluding being named a grandmaster by the mystery writers of\\namerica in 1991. but he said that his favorite award was being\\nnamed a special friend of the dineh by the navajo nation in 1987.\\nfor him, bringing the culture and history of that people  and the\\nreality of their contemporary lives  to the wider world was a\\nlife\\'s mission.\\n\\nlive in the southwest for a while and you\\'re likely to hear the\\nstory about tourists driving up in a grocery store parking lot in\\nwindow rock or chinle, ariz., to a navajo family clad in wranglers\\nand nikes and old navy t-shirts, and asking \"where are all the\\nindians on this reservation?\"\\n\\nfor hillerman the navajo were neither tourist attractions nor\\nanthropological subjects, but people. when leaphorn struggles with\\nthe heartbreaking loss of his beloved wife, first to early onset\\nalzheimer\\'s and then to death; when chee tries to reconcile his\\nheartfelt religious beliefs with a world that has less and less\\nroom for them  those are human experiences, not \"that indian\\nstuff.\"\\n\\nif you\\'re already a hillerman fan, pay

diaz-balart, the eight-term incumbent in\\nthe 21st district, is a signal that the republican stranglehold on\\nthree key congressional seats is in serious jeopardy. the races in\\nthe 18th, 21st and 25th districts are closer than they have been in\\ntwo decades, and a democratic win in any one of them would not only\\nchange the complexion of south florida politics but potentially\\nsoften u.s.

force in this election, it\\'s the\\neconomy,\" said dario moreno, a pollster with the metropolitan\\ncenter at florida international university. \"when people are\\nworried about getting foreclosed on, losing their jobs and their\\nhealth care, cuba takes a back seat.\"\\n\\nboth lincoln diaz-balart and his younger brother, mario, who has\\nrepresented the 25th district since 2002, won their districts by\\ncomfortable double digit margins of 16-18 percent in 2006. defeat\\nfor either of them could send a signal to washington that support\\nfor the 46-year-old u.s. embargo against cuba is wavering, analysts\\nsay.\\n\\nmartinez, 59, the former hialeah mayor, has tightened his race\\nagainst diaz-balart, 54, so much that the rothenberg report, a\\nnonpartisan newsletter, calls it a \"pure toss up.\" the latest\\npolling gives diaz-balart a 1-point lead, according to\\nrealclearpolitics. the spread had been 11 points when the campaign\\nbegan in january.\\n\\nmario diaz-balart, 47, also has his hands full with another\\nhigh-profile cuban-american challenger, joe garcia, 45, former\\ndirector of the influential cuban-american national foundation.\\ndiaz-balart\\'s lead is 3 points, also a toss-up, according to\\nrealclearpolitics.\\n\\na third cuban-american incumbent, ileana ros-lehtinen, 56, is\\nhaving an easier time defending her seat in the 18th district,\\nwhich includes miami beach, against a relatively unknown\\nbusinesswoman, annette taddeo, 41.\\n\\nmartinez and garcia have run well-funded campaigns with\\nadvertising on local radio and television, a first for democrats in\\nsouth florida. the ads have countered attacks from\\nrepublican-leaning spanish-language radio in miami that have\\nbranded them as \"traitors\" to the cuban exile cause. one tv ad\\ntitled \"wheel of corruption\" portrays martinez as mired in\\nrepeated scandals, including a 1991 public corruption case for\\nwhich he was convicted in federal court. the verdict was later\\noverturned and subsequent retrials ended in hung juries.\\n\\nmartinez hit back with a questionable ad that tried to tie\\ndiaz-balart to a suitcase with $50,000 in illegal campaign\\ncontributions from a crooked politician.\\n\\nthe democrats have sent $1.1-million and a steady stream of\\nhigh-profile political names to south florida, including sen.\\nhillary rodham clinton and house speaker nancy pelosi, who has\\nvisited eight times.\\n\\nthe republican national congressional committee has responded\\nwith $600,000 in advertising. \"we feel good about where

(941)\\n359-5700 ; ringling.org.\\n\\nsarasota  for ancient egyptians, death was the easy part.\\ngaining eternity was, regardless of rank, a journey that makes\\ndante\\'s inferno look like a walk in the park. and though they could\\nnot buy their way into the afterlife, those with means definitely\\nhad a strong advantage. that is the context of \"to live forever:\\negyptian treasures from the brooklyn museum\" at the john and mable\\nringling museum of art.\\n\\nmore than 100 objects spanning 4,000 years illustrate the\\nevolution of a complex system of beliefs and rituals regarding the\\ndeparture from this life and entry into the next. the twist is that\\nthe exhibition generally looks at the perspective of people of more\\nmodest means. we\\'re used to seeing the whiz-bang regalia of\\npharaohs. but what about the egyptian equivalent of joe the\\nplumber, who cared just as much about immortality as king tut?\\n\\nwe see how those lower on the food chain emulated as best they\\ncould the surface feeders and understand that it wasn\\'t just for\\nshow. how one was buried and with what accoutrements were,\\nliterally, life and death issues. amassing the money needed to pay\\nfor a proper sendoff could take years.\\n\\npreservation of the body was paramount, as was specific\\nidentification by name. different levels of mummification were\\navailable, and whether you got the full treatment, in which most of\\nthe organs were removed and everything encased in resin, or a\\nsimple wash-and-wrap job, depended on your budget. the heart,\\nconsidered to control thought and emotion, was left in the body.\\nthe brain, not believed to have value, was destroyed. in this show,\\na man named demetrios was someone of means; his remains are stored\\nin gold-washed linen and his portrait, painted in encaustic, is\\nfitted on his head. not so lucky was the stonecutter who could\\nafford only a wooden tag inscribed with his name. presumably his\\nbody was not embalmed as elaborately as demetrios\\' so his body was\\nlost to time.\\n\\nthe goal was to arrive in the netherworld beneath the earth,\\nundertake a perilous journey by boat, avoid the onslaughts of\\ndemons and find an advantageous spot to settle down permanently.\\nthe body was needed to act as a sort of template for the soul\\'s\\nresettlement, which took on a life of its own.\\n\\nthe soul was able to function corporeally after death, eating\\nand drinking. and traveling. a fear was that it would take off and\\nnot return to the body. so there were ritual chants and amulets\\nthat discouraged such truancy. those with the means had tablets\\ninscribed with incantations and descriptions from the book of the\\ndead for every stage of the journey, a cheat sheet in case they\\nwere unprepared. examples of these objects are in the show along\\nwith a papyrus fragment from the book.\\n\\na coffin was essential to this journey, acting as a protective\\ncase and safe haven for the soul in the netherworld. its importance\\nwas based on the myth of osiris , the first king of egypt, who was\\nmurdered by his brother seth (sometimes spelled set) by sealing him\\nin a coffin (made to fit his body perfectly) and throwing it in the\\nnile. osiris\\' wife isis found the coffin and managed to revive him\\nlong enough to conceive a son, horus , who eventually defeated\\nseth. osiris continued to the netherworld and ruled as its king.\\nthe evolution of the myth, embroidered with more elaborations\\nthrough the centuries, was the prototype for all egyptian funerals.\\nthe wood coffin, for example, was constructed to resemble a human\\nshape and painted with references to osiris, who passed judgment on\\nall who entered the afterlife.\\n\\na curious custom that seems to have become common was the\\nrecycling of funeral objects. even pharaohs were not above the\\npractice; scholars believe king tut\\'s coffin was originally made\\nfor an earlier, wealthier king. there are several examples of this\\nrepurposing and the intriguing, unresolved question of how\\negyptians reconciled their reverence for custom with the\\npracticalities of economy.\\n\\nunlike other large shows of egyptian antiquities i have seen,\\nthis one is not intended to inspire awe. it gives us a sense of how\\nreal people coped with the exigencies of life and aspirations in\\ndeath. because so much time is covered, we also see how many\\npractices changed. and though it dwells on the nonrich a lot, most\\nof the objects belonged to those with some means. the poorest\\npeople probably could not afford even a simple coffin.\\n\\nthe brooklyn museum, which organized the show from its own\\nenormous, world-famous collection, sent few objects made of\\nprecious metals and gems. but i really like the show. it has a\\nclear mission and makes sense of the carved stones and old statues\\nthat tend to make our eyes glaze over in many antiquities shows.\\nthe wall labels are especially well done and the catalog, for sale\\nin the museum store, has a wonderful essay about the cost of a\\nfuneral. the ringling is offering family-friendly tours every\\nsaturday and has a free activity guide and interactive area for\\nyounger visitors.\\n\\nlennie bennett is the art critic of the times and can be reached\\nat lenniesptimes.com.\\n\\nthe feed\\n\\n      elect to take note\\n\\nwith days remaining until the presidential election, you may\\nfeel as if you\\'re drowning in political media. believe me, i feel\\nyour pain.\\n\\nstill, i hope you find the strength to peruse the five biggest\\nelection media lessons/trends i\\'ve seen during the 22 months we\\'ve\\nspent watching barack obama and john mccain run for president:\\n\\n1. the new medium politicians must own is online. forget the\\nnixon/kennedy comparisons on the candidates\\' tv images: the medium\\nwhere obama really outflanked mccain is the internet. online, obama\\nraised many millions of dollars, spread videos touting his\\ncandidacy, debuted a \"fact-checking\" web site to combat negative\\nrumors and used e-mail lists to mobilize volunteers and potential\\nvoters. \"while mccain was using his resources to own the news\\ncycle, obama was registering voters,\" said media analyst andrew\\ntyndall.\\n\\n2. instant fact-checking emerges. back in 2004, when the swift\\nboat veterans for truth raised questions about democrat john\\nkerry\\'s war record, news outlets took weeks to vet the incendiary\\ncharges. this time around, web sites such as factcheck.org and the\\nst. petersburg times\\' politifact.com vetted claims made during the\\ndebates within hours. both the candidates and media know: these\\ndays, attack, response and vetting must be immediate.\\n\\n3. political satire achieved what journalism couldn\\'t. despite\\nconstant cable tv coverage, it took the daily show\\'s jon stewart\\nand saturday night live\\'s tina fey to puncture some of the\\ncampaigns\\' biggest absurdities, from the media\\'s love for obama to\\nsarah palin\\'s populist pandering. no wonder cnn and fox news now\\nhave shows blending comedy and news; this is where the cultural\\naction is.\\n\\n4. liberals developed a media echo chamber to mirror\\nconservatives. just as talk radio host rush limbaugh, the\\nwashington times newspaper and fox news channel create an echo\\nchamber of right-leaning messages, liberals developed a smaller but\\nsimilar media structure  including msnbc, blogs such as the\\nhuffington post and daily kos, and the air america radio network.\\n\\n5. political success equals positive coverage. a project for\\nexcellence in journalism study discovered mccain got more negative\\ncoverage because his campaign wasn\\'t as successful. stories on\\nmccain grew harsher as obama\\'s poll numbers improved and mccain\\'s\\nactions during september\\'s financial crisis drew criticism. \"the\\nold \\'nothing succeeds like success\\' adage was completely reinforced\\nby our study,\" said pej associate director mark jurkowitz.\\n\\nm m m\\n\\nti-vo\\n\\nthe simpsons, 8 tonight, fox: trust schlubby homer simpson to\\ncome up with a sidesplitting halloween episode two days after the\\nholiday ends. still, the show\\'s annual \"treehouse of horror\"\\nepisode shines, powered by gory, animated takes on mad men, a\\nsimpson-ized version of peanuts\\' great pumpkin story and an\\nelection day bit on a malfunctioning touch-screen voting machine.\\nfor floridians, it may feel just like home.\\n\\nti-vo\\n\\nlaw &amp;amp; order, 10 p.m. wednesday, nbc: stuck with a\\ndisintegrating wednesday night lineup, nbc made its best decision\\nso far  bringing back its mothership crime drama early,\\nre-energized by new blood. jeremy sisto and anthony anderson make a\\nwry pair as the show\\'s new detectives, and british actor linus\\nroache is masterful as the show\\'s sharp, competitive american\\nassistant district attorney. best of all, the mothership avoids the\\nschmaltzy unreality of its spinoffs, returning with an episode\\nabout a murderous street brawl and the havoc unleashed when sam\\nwaterston\\'s district attorney ruthlessly bends the law to prosecute\\nthe fighters.\\n\\nm m m\\n\\nthe list\\n\\nbesides the cable news channels, online political web sites may\\nhave benefitted most from this 22-month election cycle. according\\nto the online usage tracking site comscore.com, top political web\\nsites huffingtonpost.com, politico.com and drudgereport.com saw in\\nthe past year audience increases of

the weather, sunday\\'s\\nshift to standard time can noticeably alter weather perceptions.\\nmany weather trends begin at sunrise. the flood of solar energy\\nsets the air into motion, causing wind to increase. the temperature\\noften rises quickly after sunrise, while fog dissipates as the rays\\nof the sun penetrate the morning mist. of course, strong weather\\nsystems can overwhelm these daily cycles. but, on average, as many\\npeople begin the day, the weather this week will be windier, warmer\\nand brighter than last week as a result of the change in time.\\n\\nlew oliver\\'s mccain-palin t-shirt advertised his\\nintentions, and the woman in the suv gave him an opening. \"i\\'m\\nundecided,\" said nicole ellington, 31, a paralegal with two young\\nchildren. \"you have two minutes. go.\"\\n\\noliver knew that her family leaned republican because she was on\\nhis get-out-the-vote list, and he rapidly delivered a pitch honed\\nover 22 years of volunteering for local campaigns. \"wow, you\\'re\\ngood,\" she said. and as she drove away, oliver smiled with\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\nbut did he really win her over? ellington had pointed to the\\n\"palin\" on his t-shirt and said, \"i\\'m worried about this one.\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know,\" oliver said after giving it some thought.\\n\"she may have been being polite.\"\\n\\noliver, 47, a real estate lawyer who walks and talks in bursts,\\nis the kind of party regular who is not usually one to doubt. he\\nhas been the orange county republican party chairman since 1999,\\nand with his encyclopedic knowledge of the neighborhoods and\\ndemographics of orlando, he built the grass-roots effort that\\npushed george w. bush to victory here and statewide in 2000 and\\n2004.\\n\\nbut this year, oliver said, the challenge is tougher. part of it\\nis the \"collapse of the economy of the western world,\" he said.\\npart is the competition, a campaign by sen. barack obama that has\\npoured more money and people into the state than sen. john mccain\\nhas. even the most seasoned republicans now acknowledge that they\\nface an uphill fight.\\n\\n\"this is as difficult an environment for republicans as there\\'s\\nbeen since watergate,\" said george lemieux, the former campaign\\nmanager for gov. charlie crist, a republican.\\n\\noliver agrees. and like many republicans trying in the final\\ndays to push their party to victory, he says he has found\\ninspiration in mccain, the perseverant prisoner of war who came\\nfrom behind to seize the republican nomination. the current call to\\narms is simple: \"if anyone can pull it off, it\\'s john mccain.\"\\n\\nthe same could be said for oliver. even his counterparts in the\\nlocal democratic party describe him as one of the best organizers\\nin florida, a tireless terrier of campaigns who has missed only\\nfour of the county party\\'s meetings in 22 years.\\n\\noliver claims to dislike politics, seeing it as a way to fulfill\\nthe civic duty that led his father and two brothers to the\\nmilitary. but he is single and admits that the republican party\\nconsumes much of his free time.\\n\\non thursday, his day began at 9 a.m., calling his orlando\\nneighbors from a phone bank list he carries everywhere so he can\\nreach voters during down times. by 10 a.m., he was inside a local\\ntv news studio, where he debated the race with the local democratic\\nparty chairman.\\n\\non camera, oliver emphasized that \"no one is giving up.\" he\\nsaid that the polls were close in florida and that slight movement\\ncould bring victory.\\n\\nduring a commercial break, though, he quoted bill clinton\\n(\"it\\'s the economy, stupid\") and said, \"if i had a videotape of\\nbarack obama shooting someone, he\\'d still be up in the polls.\"\\n\\nwhat really frustrated him, he said, was that voters did not\\nseem to be recognizing what he admired about john mccain: his\\npragmatism, his toughness, his proven willingness to buck his party\\nand reach across the aisle on tough issues like immigration.\\n\\nbut lately, oliver\\'s task has become complicated as he finds\\nhimself competing with a burning fear voiced by some mccain\\nsupporters. it can be seen in the anti-obama book at the mccain\\noffice in altamonte springs; or in maitland, where someone posted a\\nletter on the wall that said: \"this is the scariest election we as\\nchristians have ever faced, and from the looks of the polls, the\\nchristians aren\\'t voting christian values.\"\\n\\njust a few feet away, a larger poster near an american flag\\nstated: \"obama -- too dangerous for our america.\"\\n\\noliver, when told about the messages, said they did not reflect\\nthe party\\'s official position and would be taken down. at the\\norlando headquarters, where he usually spends his time, no such\\nlanguage was visible.\\n\\nbut in an unscientific show of hands among 30 volunteers, more\\npeople said they were motivated by a fear of obama than by a love\\nof mccain or gov. sarah palin. such passions are double-edged: some\\nparty officials worry that the negative tone alienates independent\\nvoters; on the other hand, it has pushed volunteers to great\\nlengths.\\n\\nabout half of the volunteers at the headquarters had come from\\noutside florida, representing at least eight states, including\\nalaska, georgia and texas. many said they were volunteering for the\\nfirst time, spending as much as $2,000 of their own money to try to\\nkeep the democrats from winning.\\n\\nkrista parrett, 37, said she came from syracuse to volunteer\\nbecause she feared that an obama victory would make the united\\nstates like uzbekistan, a former soviet state ruled with an iron\\nfist, where she once lived. marlene heineman, 58, a flight\\nattendant who had come to the office during a long layover, said\\nshe worried about who might be behind obama\\'s rapid rise to\\nprominence.\\n\\n\"he has a lot of shady connections,\" heineman said. \"he\\nhasn\\'t been forthcoming.\"\\n\\nother interviews brought similar sentiments, though one\\nvolunteer, michael walzak, 46, a member of the county\\'s republican\\nexecutive committee, said he was \"disappointed that so many people\\nare that fearful.\"\\n\\noliver, for his part, has stayed focused on what he knows: how\\nto win. at 3:30 p.m., he returned from his law office, speeding\\ninto the campaign headquarters in nike running sneakers and jeans,\\nwith not just a mccain-palin shirt but also a hat.\\n\\nthe operation had just shifted from asking voters if they had\\nreceived and sent in their absentee ballots to the get-out-the-vote\\neffort.\\n\\nthis two-pronged emphasis, on absentee ballots and getting\\nvoters to the polls, has been the party\\'s focus in florida for\\ndecades. oliver said that it works in part because republicans tend\\nto be less transient than democrats, making them easier to reach,\\nand because they have historically been more loyal to their party.\\n\\nas an example, he said that 81 percent of registered republicans\\nin orange county voted in 2004, compared with about 75 percent of\\ndemocrats.\\n\\nto try to continue that tradition, oliver grabbed a list of 181\\naddresses in baldwin park, an area of working professionals.\\n\\nthe first house he visited took him to james sims, 50, who said\\nhe was happy to see fellow mccain supporters in the neighborhood.\\nthe second voter he encountered also promised to vote republican.\\n\"no matter how sick you are?\" oliver said. \"even if you have to\\ndrag yourself there on a wagon?\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" the woman said.\\n\\nit was a well-honed pitch. in his 22 years, he said he had\\nlearned a few things about voter contact. first, knock and ring the\\ndoorbell. second, step a few feet back to avoid looking\\nthreatening. and third, use humor. introductions like \"hi\" -- big\\nsmile -- \"we\\'re not selling anything\" are usually effective.\\n\\nor at least they get the conversation going. what happens next,\\nthis year at least, seems more unpredictable. just after oliver\\nsaid he had not yet found a house with republicans who said they\\nwould vote for barack obama, he encountered two of them in a row.\\n\\nbeth moriarty said that her 62-year-old husband, for the first\\ntime in his life, was going to vote for a democrat.\\n\\npatricia millar, 50, a registered independent, also said that\\nshe and her husband, jeffery bergenthal, a republican, were not\\nvoting for mccain. a blue obama sign fluttered in her lawn. she\\nseemed unsure of how to break the news.\\n\\n\"we think he\\'s a great guy,\" she said of mccain. \"we\\'re just\\na little disappointed with the ticket this year.\"\\n\\nno one disputes that iceland\\'s economic troubles are\\nlargely the country\\'s own fault. but there may be more to the\\nstory, at least in the view of iceland\\'s government, its citizens\\nand even some outsiders.\\n\\nas grave as their situation already was, they say, britain --\\ntheir old friend, nato ally and trading partner -- made it\\nimmeasurably worse.\\n\\nthe troubles between the countries began three weeks ago when\\nbritain took the extraordinary step of using its 2001\\nanti-terrorism laws to freeze the british assets of a failing\\nicelandic bank. that appeared to brand iceland a terrorist state.\\n\\n\"i must admit that i was absolutely appalled,\" the icelandic\\nforeign minister, ingibjorg solrun gisladottir, said in an\\ninterview, describing her horror at opening the british treasury\\ndepartment\\'s home page at the time and finding iceland on a list of\\nterrorist entities with al-qaida, sudan and north korea, among\\nothers.\\n\\nin a volatile economic climate, in which appearance matters\\nalmost as much as reality, being associated with terrorism is not a\\ngood thing.\\n\\n\"the immediate effect was to trigger an almost complete freeze\\non any banking transactions between iceland and abroad,\" said jon\\ndanielsson, an economist at the london school of economics. \"when\\nyou\\'re labeled a terrorist, nobody does business with you.\"\\n\\nthe icelandic prime minister, geir h. haarde, accused britain of\\n\"bullying a small neighbor,\" and said the action was \"very out\\nof proportion.\" in a recent speech in beijing, howard davies, a\\nformer deputy governor of the bank of england and now the director\\nof the london school of economics, said that britain had used a\\n\"beggar thy neighbor\" approach to iceland.\\n\\nand an online petition signed so far by more than 20 percent of\\niceland\\'s population said the british prime minister, gordon brown,\\nhad sacrificed iceland \"for his own short-term political gain,\"\\nthereby turning \"a grave situation into a national disaster.\"\\n\\niceland\\'s financial problems had been brewing for some time.\\nthis past spring, the country\\'s banks, bloated with foreign\\ndeposits and debts, began to falter. this fall, as the financial\\ncrisis deepened, the government took over two of the country\\'s\\nthree largest banks.\\n\\nthe british government, alarmed about the tens of thousands of\\naccounts held by its citizens, companies, local governments and\\ncharities, froze the british assets of one of the failed banks,\\nlandsbanki. it also seized the assets of kaupthing singer &amp;amp;\\nfriedlander, the british subsidiary of another icelandic bank,\\nkaupthing.\\n\\n\"the icelandic government, believe it or not, told me yesterday\\nthat they have no intention of honoring their obligations here,\"\\nalistair darling, the chancellor of the exchequer, declared the day\\nbritain seized the assets.\\n\\nthe icelandic government disputed that, saying it was merely\\nasking for time to make good on its obligations.\\n\\nwhatever the case, reaction was immediate and severe,\\nparticularly when brown said the following day -- inaccurately --\\nthat \"we are freezing the assets of icelandic companies in the\\nu.k. where we can.\"\\n\\niceland\\'s ambassador to britain, sverrir h. gunnlaugsson, said\\nin an interview that this statement was particularly damaging.\\n\"there was a perception in the u.k. press and among suppliers that\\neverything icelandic had been frozen,\" he said. \"the word was put\\nout belatedly that this was not the case.\"\\n\\nicelanders say that it is now nearly impossible to get foreign\\ncurrency into or out of the country. many banks have refused even\\nto transfer money to iceland. importers are having difficulty\\npaying their foreign bills, and exporters are having trouble\\ngetting paid by their foreign customers.\\n\\nmany people in iceland are also furious about what happened to\\nkaupthing singer &amp;amp; friedlander. the british government\\'s seizure of\\nits assets precipitated the immediate collapse of its parent bank,\\nkaupthing, which the icelandic government had been propping up and\\nhad hoped would survive.\\n\\n\"kaupthing was the last, best hope of the icelandic banking\\nsystem, and it was killed there and then,\" andres magnusson, an\\neditorial writer for icelandic financial news, said in an\\ninterview. \"this really was the last straw. a lot of icelanders\\nare asking, \\'excuse me: who\\'s the terrorist here?\"\\'\\n\\nthe bank\\'s collapse had repercussions beyond iceland and\\nbritain. more than 8,000 depositors, individuals and businesses,\\nhold kaupthing singer &amp;amp; friedlander accounts worth about $1.34\\nbillion on the isle of man, money they now cannot get their hands\\non -- and may never.\\n\\niceland is in line to receive a $2 billion loan from the\\ninternational monetary fund and is talking to other scandinavian\\ncountries. it is not entirely friendless: it was recently offered a\\nloan of about $52 million from the tiny faroe islands, for which it\\nis very grateful, gunnlaugsson said.\\n\\nthe icelandic government has pledged to make good on domestic\\nbank accounts. but it is still fighting with britain over how much\\nit is obliged to pay -- and how much it can afford to pay -- to\\ncompensate customers with accounts in icesave, landsbanki\\'s british\\nbranch.\\n\\nunder european regulations, iceland is obliged to pay 20,000\\neuros (about $25,000) to each individual account holder in icesave.\\nbut the total, gisladottir, the foreign minister, said, would\\namount to about 600 billion icelandic kronur -- only about $5\\nbillion at today\\'s collapsed exchange rate but fully 60 percent of\\niceland\\'s gross domestic product.\\n\\n\"the compensation that we would give would be twice as much per\\nhead as the reparations germany faced in the treaty of versailles\\nafter the first world war,\" she said. \"that is something we\\ncannot afford.\"\\n\\nthe british government has guaranteed that individual british\\naccount holders will be compensated fully, which is why it is\\nseeking to wrest as much money as possible from iceland. but no\\nsuch guarantees have been made to the british companies, local\\ngovernments, charities and universities -- including oxford and\\ncambridge -- that had icesave accounts. that figure alone is well\\nover $1 billion dollars.\\n\\niceland\\'s key interest rate now stands at 18 percent. the\\ncurrency, the krona, has declined 44 percent in the last year.\\ndanielsson, the economist, visited the country recently and found\\nthe situation grave.\\n\\n\"salaries are frozen, food prices are shooting up, and they are\\nlaying off people left, right and center,\" he said. \"companies\\nare going bankrupt all over the place. it\\'s unimaginable how bad it\\nis.\"\\n\\ngisladottir said britain\\'s decision had sent iceland back some\\n30 or 40 years, to a time when it was an isolated, poor country,\\ndependent mostly on its fishing trade.\\n\\n\"this is a major crisis,\" she said. \"we haven\\'t been in this\\nsituation for, probably, ever. we cannot solve it alone. we need\\nsolidarity from partners, from friendly countries, and we thought\\nthe u.k. was one of them.\"\\n\\nsens. barack obama and john mccain have stood (or\\nsat) for 36 debates, endured thousands of interviews, and spent\\nhundreds of millions of dollars on advertisements and the better\\npart of two years trying to convince voters that they are worthy of\\nthe presidency, or at least a vote.\\n\\nbut with only days left until election day, a small cluster of\\nholdouts -- 4 percent, according to a new york times/cbs news poll --\\nis still wrestling with the \"who are you voting for?\" question.\\n\\nwhich raises a follow-up: what is up with these people?\\n\\n\"i do not like being an \\'undecided,\"\\' said a sheepish doug\\nfinke, a 66-year-old executive at an international relocation\\nservice in louisville, ky. \"last time at this point, i definitely\\nwas decided. not this time. i find it unnerving.\"\\n\\ndoug finke, a republican, voted twice for george w. bush. he\\ndescribes himself as an economic conservative and said he had been\\n\"very impressed\" with sen. john mccain. it sure sounds as if\\nfinke is leaning toward mccain, the arizona republican, right?\\n\\nnot so fast.\\n\\n\"i\\'m socially more liberal,\" doug finke said. \"i think obama\\nis bright and has been very steady in this campaign.\" he added\\nthat it would be \"very exciting for the united states to elect a\\nblack president.\" besides, he does not think mccain\\'s running\\nmate, gov. sarah palin of alaska, would be ready to step into the\\ntop job if something happened to mccain (who, finke pointed out,\\n\"is pretty old\").\\n\\nwhere does this leave doug finke? \"i plan on doing a lot of\\nreading this weekend,\" he said.\\n\\nif the country is divided between red and blue, doug finke\\nresides in a gray state, along with a proud -- or embarrassed --\\ncorps of undecideds. they are a shrinking cohort of confused,\\nprocrastinating, indifferent or just plain indecisive consumers of\\ndemocracy. doug finke lives in a red state, kentucky, with his\\nwife, shelley, who is also a gray state citizen. she works out of\\ntheir home, where she helps manage her husband\\'s second career as a\\njazz trombonist.\\n\\n\"i tend to be a procrastinator,\" said shelley finke, 44, who\\nsaid she operated best with deadlines.\\n\\nshe voted for bush twice and describes herself as \"a\\nconservative person at heart.\" at the beginning of the campaign,\\nshe was suspicious of obama \"because of the whole hollywood\\nthing,\" but she has since warmed to him.\\n\\n\"my opinion of obama has definitely risen during this\\ncampaign,\" shelley finke said. \"and my opinion of mccain has\\nfallen.\"\\n\\nso it sure sounds as if shelley finke is moving toward obama,\\nthe illinois democrat, right?\\n\\nnot so fast.\\n\\n\"i\\'d say i\\'m leaning towards mccain,\" she said. \"for as awful\\nas things are with this republican administration, there\\'s\\nsomething about the whole conservative thing that appeals to me.\"\\nput her down as \"leaning mccain\" then.\\n\\n\"but maybe i\\'ll vote for obama,\" she said. \"how many days are\\nleft?\"\\n\\ntwo, as of sunday. while many people in this campaign-saturated\\ncountry are relieved that the election will soon be over, some of\\nthe undecideds figure, what\\'s the rush?\\n\\n\"i might flip a coin,\" said vasilios gerovasiliou, 64, of\\nconcordville, pa. his two grown sons -- like him, veterinarians --\\nare split along party lines. his wife, helen, said she was\\n\"disgusted with both sides.\"\\n\\ngerovasiliou, who emigrated from greece 35 years ago, said there\\nwere things he liked about both mccain and obama. but he also\\nbelieves that \"neither of the candidates always speaks the truth\"\\nand that \"none of them will be able to do all of the things they\\nare promising.\"\\n\\ngerovasiliou supported sen. hillary rodham clinton, loved bill\\nclinton and pretty much vowed to support anyone not named barack\\nobama after he defeated clinton in the democratic primaries.\\n\\nbut the clintons\\' endorsement of obama went a long way. \"time\\nhealed things,\" gerovasiliou said. plus, he likes obama\\'s running\\nmate, sen. joseph r. biden jr. of neighboring delaware, who is\\n\"friends with a lot of the greeks around here\" and patronizes the\\nlocal greek diners. he likes mccain, too, however. he admires his\\nservice, patriotism, and grit, and also likes that palin comes from\\na small town, just as he did from one in greece.\\n\\nwould he really flip a coin? no, he would not. \"i will just\\nhave to make a decision,\" gerovasiliou said. by the end of a\\n15-minute phone interview, he sounded a little closer to making\\none. \"i think i am leaning a little bit to someone now,\" he said.\\n\\nand that would be?\\n\\n\"biden.\"\\n\\ntalking does not necessarily bring undecideds closer to\\ndeciding. \"the more i chat, the more confused i get,\" said laura\\nwolpo, a brooklyn native who lives in palm beach gardens, fla. she\\nwas fresh from a golf outing that was filled with political\\nconversation and left her head spinning. \"people get so wacky\\nabout this stuff,\" she said.\\n\\nwolpo, 76, has usually picked a candidate by the end of the\\nconventions. that was the democrats al gore in 2000 and john kerry\\nin 2004.\\n\\nobama? \"i have great misgivings,\" she said.\\n\\n\"we are of the jewish faith,\" she said, \"and i don\\'t really\\nknow his stance on the middle east and israel.\" she also worries\\nabout his \"share the wealth ideas\" and says michelle obama comes\\non a little too strong. (\"and someone should teach her how to\\ndress, too.\")\\n\\nmccain? \"i like the man,\" she said. \"i have a great deal of\\nrespect for him.\"\\n\\nbut she has problems with him, too, some big ones. first, she is\\na strong believer in abortion rights (which mccain is not.) \"the\\ngovernment does not belong in our bedroom,\" she said. and then\\nthere is palin.\\n\\n\"oh, my god,\" wolpo said. \"some of what she says is very\\nstupid.\"\\n\\nwolpo vows to vote tuesday. she raises the possibility of a\\n\"toss of the coin,\" but then rejects the notion.\\n\\nwhen pressed, wolpo said there was probably a 60 percent chance\\nshe would support mccain. she does not buy the obama campaign\\nargument that mccain is just like bush. \"mccain knows in his heart\\nthat bush is a loser,\" she said.\\n\\neither way, wolpo said her decision did not keep her awake at\\nnight. \"i have enough to worry about,\" she said, explaining that\\nher youngest son, who is in his 40s, suffered a stroke last spring.\\nhe has good days and bad days, she said, and that puts everything\\nelse in perspective.\\n\\n\"this other thing is just an election,\" she said.\\n\\non a rainy friday evening in early august,\\nsix taliban fighters attacked a police post in a village in buner,\\na quiet farming valley just outside pakistan\\'s lawless tribal\\nregion.\\n\\nthe militants tied up eight policemen and lay them on the floor,\\nand according to local accounts, the youngest member of the gang, a\\n14-year-old, shot the captives on orders from his boss. the\\nfighters stole uniforms and weapons and fled into the mountains.\\n\\nalmost instantly, the people of buner, armed with rifles,\\ndaggers and pistols, formed a posse, and after five days they\\ncornered and killed their quarry. a video made on a cell phone\\nshowed the six militants lying in the dirt, blood oozing from their\\nwounds.\\n\\nthe stand at buner has entered the lore of pakistan\\'s war\\nagainst the militants as a dramatic example of ordinary citizens\\'\\ndetermination to draw a line against the militants.\\n\\nbut it says as much about the shortcomings of pakistan\\'s\\nincreasingly overwhelmed police forces and the pell-mell nature of\\nthe efforts to stop the militants, who week by week seem to seep\\ndeeper into pakistan from their tribal strongholds.\\n\\nsince the events in buner, the inspector general of the police\\nin the north-west frontier province, malik naveed khan, has\\nencouraged citizens in other towns and villages in his realm to\\nform posses of their own.\\n\\nthe hope is that determination itself will deter taliban\\nencroachment, building on the august victory with one phalanx after\\nanother of committed citizens.\\n\\nbut the strategy is also a sign of his desperation.\\n\\n\"we are laying down our lives,\" khan said in an interview in\\noctober. \"by the hundreds the police are being targeted and\\nkilled.\"\\n\\nhe has had to lower recruitment standards to fill out the ranks,\\nhe said, \"because this is war.\" even so, he has supplemented his\\nforce with what he said were some 15,000 \"special police\" --\\ncitizens whom he cannot pay, but whom he is willing to arm. \"any\\ncommunity which helps us, we give them weapons,\" khan said.\\n\\nthe army was of no use here.\\n\\n\"there is no other way,\" khan said. \"pure military action\\nwould create a lot of devastation, to the extent that people would\\nturn against the government.\"\\n\\nindeed, after the taliban were cornered, a new peace committee\\ncomposed of elders and politicians passed a resolution declaring\\nbuner a zone free of both the army and the taliban.\\n\\nthe local police chief in the buner district, zubair shah, a\\nrising star of the pakistani police force, acknowledged the\\nchallenges of confronting a taliban threat that is more deeply\\nensconced in communities all over pakistan than had been thought.\\n\\nhe is trying to tamp down the taliban with a police force that\\nis grossly underpaid and frequently overmatched by better armed\\nmilitants. currently, the police officers in buner earn about\\none-quarter the monthly salary that the taliban are offering, shah\\nsaid.\\n\\nmoreover, given that the police have become a primary target of\\nthe militants, it is hardly surprising that morale has plummeted.\\n\"the people are more motivated than the police,\" he said.\\n\\nin the tribal areas to the west of the buner district, the\\npakistani army is now encouraging tribal militias, known as\\nlashkars, as a backup force against the taliban. such militias have\\na long tradition in tribal society.\\n\\nbut even there, they have met with little success in the current\\nconflict.\\n\\nby contrast, posses like the one in buner have not been tried\\nbefore in the settled parts of pakistan outside the tribal areas,\\nkhan said. they have in any case become a necessary tool to help\\npreserve the peace.\\n\\nthe citizens of buner, interviewed in late october after the\\npolice arranged an escort to the area, where security is still\\nsketchy, said they had taken matters into their own hands to keep\\nnot only the militants at bay, but the army as well.\\n\\nin areas where the army has had to confront the militants,\\nfighting has ensued on the scale of a civil war, displacing tens of\\nthousands of people. if citizens\\' militias sound like civil war\\nalready, that is precisely what the people of buner say they are\\nhoping to avoid.\\n\\nsuch wrenching violence has been the fate already of the\\nneighboring swat valley, and of nearby bajaur, an area of the\\ntribal region, where the army and militants have been locked in\\nheavy fighting. civilian casualties are high. the task of pushing\\nback the taliban is taking far longer than the army had\\nanticipated.\\n\\nin swat, the army has been unable to stop the burning of more\\nthan 100 girls schools or the murders of politicians and their\\nfamilies. about one-third of the police force has deserted in swat,\\nand some of the deserters have joined the taliban, even as\\ntrainers, according to senior police officials.\\n\\nin bajaur, more than 200,000 people have fled, becoming refugees\\nin appalling conditions in makeshift camps.\\n\\nthe villagers in buner say they would prefer to handle the\\ntaliban on their own, rather than have the heavy hand of the army\\ncome and do it for them.\\n\\nthey did it with gusto, later lining up the bodies of their\\ntaliban victims at a hospital like trophies so citizens could take\\na closer look.\\n\\n\"we don\\'t want happening here, what is happening around us,\"\\nsaid mohammed zada, a retired bank manager, and a driving force\\nbehind the peace council. \"the people are very unified, so the\\ntaliban failed. we are dead set against the army, too.\"\\n\\nwhile the resolve of local residents is heartening, shah, an\\nexpert in counterterrorism, understands better than most pakistanis\\nwhat kind of threat he is up against.\\n\\nhe has taught police investigative work with the united nations\\nin bosnia and was selected by the u.s. consulate in peshawar for a\\nmonth-long leadership program in the united states. he recently\\nspent a year in australia studying transnational terrorism.\\n\\nas in many areas of pakistan -- from karachi to islamabad, and\\nfrom rural districts in the north to the cultural capital, lahore --\\nthe taliban have sympathizers and workers in buner who lie low in\\nsleeper cells that can be easily activated, shah said.\\n\\nsoon after the citizen posse killed the six taliban, he said,\\nundercover work led police officers to a house where they found a\\nsuicide vest packed with 20 pounds of explosives and 15 pounds of\\nball bearings.\\n\\nthat discovery led to a potentially more lethal find: a full kit\\nof ingredients for major explosions.\\n\\nin a house near his police headquarters, investigators found\\nmore than 500 pounds of explosives, a cache of 30 detonators, 10\\nremote-control devices, dozens of battery cells, a police uniform\\nand a motorcycle, shah said.\\n\\nworryingly, he said, the explosives had been methodically\\ndelivered into buner over time in small parcels by motorbike.\\n\\none of the men arrested in the case had been friendly with the\\npolice, a shopkeeper who prayed at the same mosque as the police.\\n\\nmany of the villagers in buner had relatives working abroad -- in\\nmalaysia, in dubai and as taxi drivers in arlington, va. -- who sent\\nremittances home. the relative wealth and a long-standing social\\ncohesion had helped to fortify the community and keep the taliban\\nat bay.\\n\\nunder these circumstances, the police chief said, people power\\nwas his best bet. \"if the militants enter buner,\" he said, \"all\\nyou need to do is go to the mosque loudspeakers and shout, and\\npeople will be mobilized.\"\\n\\nfacing labor shortages back in 1990 but\\never wary of allowing in foreigners, japan made an exception for\\njapanese-brazilians. with their japanese roots, names and faces,\\nthese children and grandchildren of japanese immigrants to brazil\\nwould fit more easily in a society fiercely closed to outsiders, or\\nso the reasoning went.\\n\\nin the two decades since then, despite periodic economic\\ndownturns like the current one, the number of japanese-brazilian\\nworkers in japan has kept growing. they are clustered in industrial\\nregions dotted with factories supplying familiar companies like\\nhonda, sanyo and toyota, whose headquarters gave this city in\\ncentral japan its name.\\n\\nbut perhaps nowhere in this country do japanese and\\njapanese-brazilians rub shoulders with such intensity as in a\\npublic housing complex here called homi estate. built in the 1970s\\nfor young japanese families, homi has a population of 8,891 that is\\nnow nearly evenly split between japanese, at 52 percent, and\\nforeigners, at 48 percent.\\n\\n\"to be honest,\" toshinori fujiwara, 69, a japanese community\\nleader, said, \"i never imagined in my wildest dreams that this\\nwould ever become a multiethnic neighborhood.\"\\n\\na generation from now, more japanese are likely to be making\\nsimilar comments as japan\\'s population ages and its work force\\nshrinks. recently labor shortages have spread from factories to\\nfarms, fishing boats, hospitals and other areas, prompting japan to\\nopen its doors to temporary workers from china and elsewhere in\\nasia.\\n\\nas the demographic squeeze grows tighter, japan may have to open\\nitself further to immigration, experts say, if it is to have the\\nworkers it needs to remain a major industrial power. a homogeneous\\nand insular nation, however, japan is notoriously unwelcoming to\\nimmigrants; koreans who came here during world war ii are still\\ntreated as second-class citizens.\\n\\nto make itself an attractive destination for immigrants, the\\nexperts say, japan will have to undergo a difficult cultural\\ntransformation for which the japanese-brazilians pose an elementary\\ntest case. if even they cannot gain acceptance, what chance will\\nthere be forimmigrant groups that may be ethnically, racially,\\nreligiously and nationally different from native japanese?\\n\\nimmigration is an unpopular and politically delicate topic. but\\nthe country\\'s 317,000 japanese-brazilians -- whose children are\\ngrowing up in japan and, in many cases, coming of age here --\\neffectively make up japan\\'s largest immigrant population. of the\\ntotal, nearly 94,400 have acquired permanent residence, while the\\nothers can stay in japan indefinitely. children born in japan of\\nforeign parents do not automatically get citizenship.\\n\\na city within a city, homi estate -- 40 apartment buildings,\\ndetached houses, schools and shops -- looks like any other japanese\\nhousing complex from afar. but, on closer inspection, street signs\\nare in japanese and portuguese. in the community\\'s shopping\\ncomplex, restaurants serve brazilian dishes; a convenience store\\ndisplays brazilian magazines. a japanese supermarket was replaced\\nby a japanese-brazilian one last year, reflecting homi\\'s shifting\\ndemographics.\\n\\nother differences are more subtle. some elevators are covered\\nwith scratches, a kind of vandalism rarely seen in japan. and\\nparking lots contain cars retrofitted into low-riders and painted\\npurple, while japanese tend to stick to white or gray.\\n\\nin the beginning, the japanese did not understand why the\\njapanese-brazilians played loud music, failed to sort their trash\\nperfectly and did not seem bothered about arriving late to\\nappointments. for the japanese-brazilians, their grandparents\\' or\\nparents\\' often rose-tinted image of japan seemed dated at best, and\\nthey felt unwelcome.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve been lucky, because the japanese have been kind to me,\"\\nsaid rita okokama, 40, a japanese-brazilian who has been here 18\\nyears and owns padaria, a small sandwich shop. \"but others have\\nfaced prejudice. for example, japanese shop owners will follow\\naround japanese-brazilian customers because they think they\\'ll\\nshoplift.\"\\n\\na decade ago, japanese-brazilians even clashed with japanese\\nright-wing groups singling out foreigners. but the situation began\\nimproving five years ago as the japanese and the\\njapanese-brazilians learned to live with one another and organized\\njoint events, like barbecues, said kunikazu ihara, 65, a local ward\\nleader. another reason for the improvement may be that japanese\\nunwilling to live next to japanese-brazilians simply moved.\\n\\n\"if they were surrounded by foreigners, especially those in\\nrental apartments, some japanese just got out,\" ihara said.\\n\\nby contrast, the japanese who stayed appeared committed to\\ngetting along.\\n\\n\"japanese tend to be insular and build shells around\\nthemselves,\" said kimio yamamoto, 71, a retired japanese engineer\\nwho has become a familiar face at homi\\'s japanese-brazilian-run\\nfitness club. \"and foreigners can feel that right away.\"\\n\\nas he worked on his pectorals, yamamoto said the\\njapanese-brazilians had immediately made him feel at home at the\\nclub. \"it\\'s fun,\" he said.\\n\\nstill, most adults keep a polite distance from one another.\\n\\n\"children become amigos,\" said fujiwara, the japanese\\ncommunity leader, who is taking portuguese lessons and sprinkles\\nhis japanese with portuguese words. \"but adults, they don\\'t become\\namigos.\"\\n\\nat west homi elementary, where japanese-brazilian children\\naccount for 53 percent of the 196 students, supplementary japanese\\nlanguage classes are offered, as well as help in other subjects.\\npartly as a result, japanese-brazilian children do not drop out, a\\ncommon problem in other public schools, where foreign children are\\noften bullied.\\n\\nbecause of the growing number of japanese-brazilian students,\\nsome japanese parents were wary of letting their own children stay\\nat the school. school officials tried to persuade the japanese to\\nkeep their children here by emphasizing the positive side effects\\nof the japanese-brazilian presence.\\n\\n\"this is no longer the era of a homogeneous people, but rather\\nof a multiethnic society,\" said mitsuyuki shibuya, a school\\nofficial.\\n\\nthe new era may be symbolized by a 9-year-old japanese-brazilian\\nstudent named nicholas wada, who has taken home prizes for poetry\\nand other subjects, which his parents proudly display. his parents,\\njoao, 44, and silvana, 40, came to japan 18 years ago and also\\nreared a daughter, veridiana, 22, here.\\n\\nthis year they built a two-story detached house as a sign of\\ntheir commitment to japan.\\n\\n\"my son has no image at all of brazil, so we built this house\\nfor him,\" wada said in the couple\\'s living room. \"nicholas says\\nhe doesn\\'t want to go to brazil.\"\\n\\n\"he thinks in japanese,\" wada, a truck driver, added.\\n\\nlike most japanese-brazilians -- indeed, like almost all\\nimmigrants throughout the world -- the wadas arrived here intending\\nto stay only two or three years. \"even if you ask us now, we\\'ll\\nsay we\\'re going back in two to three years,\" wada said.\\n\\nuncertain about how long they will stay in japan, many\\njapanese-brazilians send their children to private\\nportuguese-language schools or keep them out of school altogether.\\ngoing to school is not compulsory for foreigners.\\n\\nof the nearly 33,500 japanese-brazilian children in japan\\nbetween 5 and 14 years old, the ages of compulsory education, about\\n10,000 are in japanese schools receiving remedial japanese lessons,\\naccording to government figures. most of the rest are likely in\\nportuguese-language schools or not attending school.\\n\\nchildren who do not attend japanese schools tend to become\\nisolated from japanese society, said kiyoe ito, the chairwoman of\\ntorcida, a private organization that teaches japanese to\\njapanese-brazilian children in homi. even if they intend to move to\\nbrazil, their understanding of that country is also limited.\\n\\none boy studying japanese at torcida one recent morning was\\nbruno da costa, 15, whose japanese maternal grandparents had\\nimmigrated to brazil. with his parents, bruno had moved to japan at\\nthe age of 1, but he was unable to express himself in japanese. he\\nsaid he understood most of his favorite cartoon on television,\\n\"naruto,\" but movies were beyond his comprehension.\\n\\n\"i feel brazilian because i went to a portuguese school,\"\\nbruno said. \"if i\\'d gone to a japanese school, maybe i\\'d feel\\ndifferently. but japan is also my country; i grew up here. brazil,\\ni think, is a dangerous country. i mean, i\\'d

people like\\nhim -- a struggling black man whose vote, he was convinced, surely\\nwould not count for much of anything. the thought became ingrained\\nas an adult, almost like common sense. and that partly explains\\nwhy, at age 55, he just registered to vote for the first time a\\nmonth ago.\\n\\nthe other part of the reason is sen. barack obama.\\n\\n\"this is huge,\" battle, a janitor, said after his overnight\\nshift cleaning a movie theater. \"this is bigger than life itself.\\nwhen i was coming up, i always thought they put in who they wanted\\nto put in. i didn\\'t think my vote mattered. but i don\\'t think that\\nanymore.\"\\n\\nacross the country, black men and women like battle, who have\\nlong been disaffected, apolitical, discouraged or just plain bored\\nwith politics, say they have snapped to attention this year,\\naccording to dozens of interviews conducted in the last several\\ndays in six states.\\n\\nthey are people like 25-year-old percy matthews, of chicago\\'s\\nsouth side, who did vote once, but whose experience was so\\nforgettable that he cannot recall with certainty for whom he cast a\\nballot, or even what year it was. now an enthusiastic democrat, he\\nsays the old days are gone.\\n\\nand shandell wilcox, 29, who registered to vote in jacksonville,\\nfla., when she was 18, then proceeded to ignore every election\\nbefore the current one. she voted for the first time wednesday.\\n\\nover and again, first-time and relatively new voters like\\nmatthews and wilcox, far past the legal voting age, said they were\\ninspired by the singularity of the 2008 election and the power of\\nobama\\'s magnetism. many also said they were loath to miss out on\\ntheir part in writing what could be a new chapter of american\\nhistory -- the chance to vote for a black president.\\n\\nbattle, for one, remembers growing up in the pruitt-igoe housing\\nproject in st. louis and how intimidated the adults were about\\nvoting, and that left an impression on him. the older women he knew\\nwere afraid to walk to the polls, he said, for fear of being\\nattacked.\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t think it was for black people, period,\" he said of\\npolitics before the civil rights era. \"we didn\\'t have any rights,\\nreally. we were just coming into voting and everything.\"\\n\\nfast-forwarding to the present, he continued: \"i never thought\\nthat i\\'d see this day. i never thought i\\'d see the day where an\\nafrican-american was standing at the podium, getting ready to be\\npresident.\"\\n\\nthe swelling ranks of the newly enthusiastic are also the result\\nof extensive nationwide voter registration drives and new\\nearly-voting procedures in many states, which have made the process\\neasier and more accessible.\\n\\ndavid bositis, senior political analyst at the joint center for\\npolitical and economic studies in washington, said the states with\\nthe largest increases in early voting have been those where the\\nblack population is proportionally the highest. in georgia, for\\ninstance, blacks represented a quarter of all voters in the 2004\\npresidential election. so far this year in early voting alone, they\\nmake up 35 percent of all voters.\\n\\n\"i am fully expecting record black turnout,\" bositis said.\\n\"it\\'s not just a question of obama as the first black nominee;\\nit\\'s also that blacks have suffered substantially under the bush\\nyears and blacks have been the single most anti-iraq-war group in\\nthe population.\"\\n\\nhe added, \"obama is like the icing on the cake, but it\\'s not\\njust a question of obama.\"\\n\\none early voter in georgia was armento meredith, 43, who waited\\nin line for two hours at the fulton county government building in\\ndowntown atlanta to vote for the first time thursday. \"it\\'s time\\nfor a change,\" meredith, a telephone operator, said. \"i want to\\nsee something different.\"\\n\\nthe result is likely to be a level of black participation in the\\nelectoral process that is higher than ever before. if sustained,\\nsome of those interviewed said, it might also translate into a\\nreinvigorated spirit of democracy in some communities where it has\\nbeen long dormant.\\n\\n\"in the black community, i see a great many people coming out\\nwho were apathetic since \\'84,\" said bob law, 63, an activist in\\nnew york city and former radio host who worked on the rev. jesse\\njackson\\'s campaign for the presidency in 1984, the first time a\\nblack candidate was a serious national contender. but in the years\\nsince, he said, blacks\\' enthusiasm had waned.\\n\\n\"people didn\\'t vote before because they really didn\\'t think\\ntheir vote was going to make a difference,\" law said. \"whenever\\nblack voters felt like there was a reason to vote, like it might\\nmean something, they\\'ve turned out.\"\\n\\nthat is exactly how battle, the janitor in st. louis, feels. in\\nthe past, \"i felt like democrat or republican, it didn\\'t matter\\nwho won,\" he said. \"but my guy obama? i think it\\'s going to be a\\nchange if he wins. he\\'s speaking my language.\"\\n\\nfor some black men and women, the sense of pride is\\noverwhelming, as is the feeling that they are participating in what\\ncould become a touchstone moment, something that children and\\ngrandchildren will want to hear about.\\n\\n\"i\\'d feel bad forever if i didn\\'t get out this time,\" said\\nwilcox of jacksonville, a cafeteria worker. \"i\\'d feel like i\\ndidn\\'t do my part to put him in the office. how would i explain\\nthat to my little girl? \\'oh, i had something better to do\\'? and\\nsure, it\\'s partially because he\\'s african-american. but he also\\nsays there will be change and i believe him.\"\\n\\ntimothy hairston, 47, a bartender in brooklyn, n.y., who has\\nnever voted before, shared that point of view. \"i wanted to be a\\npart of a historical moment, to say that i was involved in history\\nin the making, that i was an active participant as opposed to\\nsomeone on the sidelines rooting for change but not involved in the\\nprocess of making change.\"\\n\\nhe added of obama: \"i think it\\'s a testament to his campaign\\nthat he can inspire. at the end of the day, no matter what party\\nyou vote for, i think every once in a while there are inspirational\\nmoments that call for people to wake up from their deep sleep and\\nbecome alive and get involved. and i think barack at the very least\\nis an inspirational figure.\"\\n\\nfor some, coming back to political life was a slow process that\\nunfolded over months. others said they were struck by something in\\nobama\\'s life or what he stands for, and conversion was immediate.\\n\\nwilcox saw some of her own biography reflected in obama\\'s. they\\nwere both born to single mothers and raised mostly by their\\ngrandparents in modest settings. wilcox said she felt validated,\\nmotivated and inspired all at once when she first heard obama\\'s\\nlife story during the primary season. \"i began to think that we\\nhad a lot of life features in common,\" she said. \"it gave me\\nhope.\"\\n\\nbianca williams, 20, a hair stylist in brooklyn, said the\\ncampaign had changed her life. after seeing obama in the first\\ndebate, she decided to go back to community college part-time.\\n\"after seeing his success, i started thinking maybe i could help\\nmy community like he did,\" she said. \"if he could do it, then i\\ncould do it. it woke me up, career-wise. it just gave me the\\nwillpower to go on.\"\\n\\nthat is also true for matthews, who works in a chicago coffee\\nshop. not too long ago, he said, he lied to his mother about having\\nvoted in an election just so that she would stop nagging him to get\\nout and vote. what a difference this year has made: he said he\\nwatched the party conventions and three of the four presidential\\nand vice presidential debates. he has followed coverage of the\\ncandidates in the local papers. he voted in the primary, and he\\ncannot wait to vote tuesday.\\n\\n\"as i\\'m talking now, i\\'m getting goose bumps,\" he said.\\n\\nfor 18-year-old darnell harris of cleveland, a private in the\\nmarines, the legal voting age could not come fast enough. \"i\\'m\\nexcited that the first time i get to vote, it\\'s for barack,\" he\\nsaid. and echoing many others, he said that race is only part of\\nthe reason. \"obama cares about everybody, whether they\\'re white,\\nblack, chinese, whatever. he\\'s not just for one little group.\"\\n\\nfor some new voters, family and peer pressure certainly played a\\nrole.\\n\\n\"most of my life, i didn\\'t want to get involved with anything\\npolitical,\" said damien henderson, a 26-year-old merchant seaman.\\n\"but everywhere i go lately people are talking about barack obama.\\ni could be standing in line at a grocery and somebody\\'s going to\\nask me what i think about barack obama.\"\\n\\nhenderson said he started paying attention and fell for obama\\'s\\ncharisma. he voted for the first time monday, for obama.\\n\\nhow did it feel to cast that first vote?\\n\\n\"it actually felt really good,\" he said.\\n\\n\"people come up to me in the grocery store and say, \\'how did we\\nget suckered into this?\\' all i can tell them is, \\'we thought we\\nwere making the smart choice.\"\\'\\n\\n-- marc hujik, an investment adviser and school board member in\\nkenosha, wis.\\n\\non a snowy day two years ago, the school board in whitefish bay,\\nwis., gathered to discuss a looming problem: how to plug a gaping\\nhole in the teachers\\' retirement plan.\\n\\nit turned to david w. noack, a trusted local investment banker,\\nwho proposed they borrow from overseas and use the money for a\\ncomplex investment that offered big profits.\\n\\n\"every three months you\\'re going to get a payment,\" he\\npromised, according to a tape of the meeting. but would it be\\nrisky? \"there would need to be 15 enrons\" for the district to\\nlose money, he said.\\n\\nthe board and four other nearby school districts ultimately\\ninvested $200 million in noack\\'s deal, most of it borrowed from an\\nirish bank. without realizing it, the schools were imitating hedge\\nfunds.\\n\\nacross the country, new york subway officials were also being\\nwooed by bankers. officials were told that just as homebuyers had\\nembraced adjustable-rate loans, new york could save money by\\nborrowing at lower interest rates that changed every day.\\n\\nfor some of the deals, the officials were encouraged to rely on\\nthe same irish bank as the wisconsin schools.\\n\\nduring the go-go investing years, school districts, transit\\nagencies and other government entities were quick to jump into the\\nglobal economy, hoping for fast gains to cover growing pension\\ncosts and budgets without raising taxes. deals were arranged by\\narmies of persuasive financiers who received big paydays.\\n\\nbut now, hundreds of cities and government agencies are facing\\neconomic turmoil. far from being isolated examples, the wisconsin\\nschools and new york\\'s subway system are among the many players in\\na financial fiasco that has ricocheted globally.\\n\\nthe bank at the center of their saga, named depfa, is now in\\ntrouble. the wisconsin schools are on the brink of losing their\\nmoney, confronting educators with possible budget cuts. interest\\nrates for new york\\'s subways are skyrocketing and contributing to\\nbudget woes that have transportation officials considering higher\\nfares and delaying long-planned track repairs.\\n\\nand the bank\\'s problems have threatened the stability of its\\nparent company in munich, forcing german officials to intervene\\nwith a multibillion-dollar bailout to stop a chain reaction that\\ncould freeze germany\\'s economic system.\\n\\n\"i am really worried,\" said becky velvikis, a first-grade\\nteacher at grewenow elementary in kenosha, wis., one of the\\ndistricts that invested in noack\\'s deal. \"if millions of dollars\\nare gone, what happens to my retirement? or the construction paper\\nand pencils and supplies we need to teach?\"\\n\\nthe trail through wisconsin, new york and europe illustrates how\\nthis financial crisis has moved around the world so fast, why it is\\nso hard to tame, and why cities, schools and many other\\ninstitutions will probably struggle for years.\\n\\n\"the local papers and radio shows call us idiots, and now when\\ni go home, my kids ask me, \\'dad, did you do something wrong?\"\\'\\nsaid shawn yde, the director of business services in the whitefish\\nbay district. \"this is something i\\'ll regret until the day i\\ndie.\"\\n\\nselling risk\\n\\nwhitefish bay\\'s school district did not intend to become a hedge\\nfund. it and four nearby districts were just trying to finance\\nretirement obligations that were growing as health care costs rose.\\n\\nnoack, the local representative of stifel, nicolaus &amp;amp; co., a st.\\nlouis investment bank, had been advising wisconsin school boards\\nfor two decades, helping them borrow for new gymnasiums and\\nclassrooms. his father had taught at an area high school for 47\\nyears. all six of his children attended milwaukee schools.\\n\\nnoack told the whitefish bay board that investing in the global\\neconomy carried few risks, according to the tape.\\n\\n\"what\\'s the best investment? it\\'s called a collateralized debt\\nobligation,\" or a cdo, noack said. he described it as a collection\\nof bonds from 105 of the most reputable companies that would pay\\nthe school board a small return every quarter.\\n\\n\"we\\'re being very conservative,\" noack told the board,\\ncomposed of lawyers, salesmen and a homemaker who lived in the\\naffluent milwaukee suburb.\\n\\nsoon, whitefish bay and the four other districts borrowed $165\\nmillion from depfa and contributed $35 million of their own money\\nto purchase three cdos sold by the royal bank of canada, which had\\na relationship with noack\\'s company.\\n\\nbut noack\\'s explanation of a cdo was very wrong. noack, who\\nthrough his lawyer declined to comment, had attended only a\\ntwo-hour training session on cdos, he told a friend.\\n\\nthe schools\\' $200 million was actually used as collateral for a\\ncomplicated form of insurance guaranteeing about $20 billion of\\ncorporate bonds. that investment -- known as a synthetic cdo --\\ncommitted the boards to paying off other bondholders if\\ncorporations failed to honor their debts.\\n\\nif just 6 percent of the bonds insured went bad, the wisconsin\\neducators could lose all their money. if none of the bonds\\ndefaulted, the schools would receive about $1.8 million a year\\nafter paying off their own debt. by comparison, the cdos offered\\nonly a modestly better return than a $35 million investment in\\nultra-safe treasury bonds, which would have paid about $1.5 million\\na year, with virtually no risk.\\n\\nthe boards, as part of their deal, received thick packets of\\ndocuments.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve never read the prospectus,\" said marc hujik, a local\\nfinancial adviser and a member of the kenosha school board who\\nspent 13 years on wall street. \"we had all our questions answered\\nsatisfactorily by dave noack, so i wasn\\'t worried.\"\\n\\nwisconsin schools were not the only ones to jump into such\\ncomplicated financial products. more than $1.2 trillion of cdos\\nhave been sold to buyers of all kinds since 2005 -- including many\\ncities and government agencies -- an increase of 270 percent from\\nthe four previous years combined, according to thomson reuters.\\n\\n\"selling these products to municipalities was pretty\\nwidespread,\" said janet tavakoli, a finance industry consultant in\\nchicago. \"they tend to be less sophisticated. so bankers sell them\\nproducts stuffed with junk.\"\\n\\nfrom the wisconsin deal, the royal bank of canada received\\npromises of payments totaling about $11.2 million, according to\\ndocuments. stifel nicolaus made about $1.2 million. noack\\'s total\\nsalary was about $300,000 a year, according to someone with\\nknowledge of his finances. and depfa received interest on its\\nloans.\\n\\nin separate statements, the royal bank of canada and stifel\\nnicolaus said board members signed documents indicating they\\nunderstood the investments\\' risks. both companies said they were\\nnot financial advisers to the boards but merely sold them products\\nor services. stifel nicolaus said its relationship with the boards\\nended in 2007. noack now works for a rival firm.\\n\\n\"everyone knew new york guys were making tons of money on these\\nkinds of deals,\" said hujik, of the school board. \"it wasn\\'t\\nimplausible that we could make money, too.\"\\n\\na bank goes global\\n\\nby the time depfa financed the wisconsin schools\\' investment, it\\nhad already become an emblem of the new global economy. it was\\nfounded 86 years ago as a sleepy german lender, and for most of its\\nhistory had focused on its home market.\\n\\nbut in 2002 a new chief executive, gerhard bruckermann, moved\\ndepfa to the freewheeling financial center of dublin, ireland, to\\ntake advantage of low corporate taxes. he soon pushed the company\\ninto sao paulo, brazil; mumbai, india; warsaw, poland; hong kong,\\ndallas, new york, tokyo and elsewhere. depfa became one of europe\\'s\\nmost profitable banks and was famous for lavish events and large\\npaychecks. in 2006, top executives took home the equivalent of $33\\nmillion at current exchange rates.\\n\\nbruckermann was a gregarious leader who joked that he hoped to\\nmake all employees into millionaires. he divided his time between a\\nlondon home and a vast farm in spain, where he grew exotic\\nmedicinal plants. and his success fueled an arrogance, former\\ncolleagues say.\\n\\nbruckermann once told a trade publication that depfa, unlike\\ngerman banks, understood how to benefit from the global economy.\\n\"with our efforts, we are like the one-eyed man who becomes king\\nin the land of the blind,\" he was quoted as saying.\\n\\nbruckermann, who left the bank earlier this year, did not\\nrespond to requests for an interview.\\n\\nbut as depfa grew, other european banks began competing with the\\nfirm. so executives stretched into riskier deals -- the sort that\\nwould eventually send shockwaves across europe and the united\\nstates.\\n\\nsome of bruckermann\\'s employees grew concerned about deals like\\none struck in 2005 with the metropolitan transportation authority\\nof new york, the agency overseeing the city and suburban subways,\\nbuses and trains.\\n\\nfor years, municipal agencies like the metropolitan\\ntransportation authority of new york, the agency overseeing the\\ncity and suburban subways, buses and trains, had raised money by\\nissuing plain-vanilla bonds with fixed interest rates. but then\\nbankers began telling officials that there was a way to get cheaper\\nfinancing.\\n\\nbankers said that cities, like homebuyers, could save money with\\nadjustable-rate loans, where the payments started low and changed\\nover time. what they did not emphasize was that such payments could\\neventually skyrocket. such borrowing -- known as variable-rate bonds\\n-- also carried big fees for wall street.\\n\\nthe pitches were very successful. municipalities issued twice as\\nmany variable-rate bonds last year as they did a decade earlier.\\n\\nbut variable-rate bonds had a hitch: many investors would\\npurchase them only if a bank like depfa was hired as a buyer of\\nlast resort, ready to acquire bonds from investors who could find\\nno other buyers. depfa collected fees for serving that role, but\\nexpected it would rarely have to honor such pledges.\\n\\ndepfa\\'s salespeople traveled the world encouraging officials to\\nsign up for variable-rate loans. and bureaucrats and politicians,\\nincluding some in new york, jumped in.\\n\\nby 2006 depfa was the largest buyer of last resort in the world,\\nstanding behind $2.9 billion of bonds issued that year alone. it\\nbacked a $200 million bond issued by the mta.\\n\\nbut as depfa grew, it became more reliant on enormous short-term\\nloans to finance its operations. those loans cost less, and thus\\nhelped the bank achieve higher profits, but only when times were\\ngood. indeed, some employees were worried about that debt.\\n\\nin 2007, even as the global economy was softening, one of\\ngermany\\'s biggest lenders, hypo real estate, purchased depfa for\\n$7.8 billion. the ceo\\'s cut was more than $150 million. he then\\nleft the company to grow oranges on his spanish estate.\\n\\nthe investments falter\\n\\nlast march the delicate web tying milwaukee, dublin and\\nmanhattan became an anchor dragging everyone down.\\n\\nyde, the director of business services for the whitefish bay\\ndistrict, began receiving troubling messages indicating the\\ndistrict\\'s investments were declining. worried, he started coming\\ninto his office at dawn, before the hallways of whitefish bay high\\nschool filled with students.\\n\\nas the sun rose, yde searched for explanations by the light of\\nhis computer screen. he googled \"cdos.\" he called bankers in\\nlondon and new york. each person referred him to someone else.\\n\\nthen notices arrived saying that the bonds insured by whitefish\\nbay\\'s cdos were defaulting. it became increasingly likely that the\\ndistrict\\'s money would be seized to pay off other bondholders.\\nmost, if not all, of the $200 million would probably be lost.\\n\\nas other districts received similar notices, panic grew. for\\nsome boards, interest payments on borrowed money were now larger\\nthan revenue from the investments. officials began quietly warning\\nthat they might have to dip into school funds.\\n\\n\"this is going to have a tremendous financial impact,\" said\\nrobert f. kitchen, a member of the west allis-west milwaukee school\\nboard. officials say some districts may have to cut courses like\\nart and drama, curtail gym and classroom maintenance, or forgo\\nreplacing teachers who retire.\\n\\nproblems were emerging elsewhere, as well.\\n\\ndepfa\\'s executives were realizing that bonds all over the world\\nwere declining in value, exposing the company to the possibility\\nthey would have to make good on their pledges as a buyer of last\\nresort. and depfa was still borrowing billions each month to cover\\nits short-term loans. by autumn, the short-term debt of the bank\\nand its parent company, hypo, totaled $81 billion.\\n\\nthen, in mid-september, the american investment bank lehman\\nbrothers went bankrupt. short-term lending markets froze up.\\nratings agencies, including standard &amp;amp; poor\\'s, downgraded depfa,\\nciting the company\\'s difficulties borrowing at affordable rates.\\n\\nthat set off a crisis in germany, where officials worried that\\ndepfa\\'s sudden need for cash would drag down its parent company and\\nset off a chain reaction at other banks. the german government and\\nprivate banks extended $64 billion in credit to hypo to stop it\\nfrom imploding.\\n\\n\"we will not allow the distress of one financial institution to\\nendanger the entire system,\" angela merkel, the german chancellor,\\nsaid at the time.\\n\\nthat crisis spread almost immediately to the mta.\\n\\n      (begin optional trim.)\\n\\nthe transportation authority, guided by gary dellaverson, a\\nrumpled, cigarillo-smoking chief financial officer, had $3.75\\nbillion of variable-rate debt outstanding.\\n\\nabout $200 million of that debt was backed by depfa. when the\\nbank was downgraded, investors dumped those transportation bonds,\\nbecause of worries they would get stuck with them if depfa\\'s\\nproblems worsened. depfa was forced to buy $150 million of them,\\nand bonds worth billions of dollars issued by other municipalities.\\n\\nthen came the twist: depfa\\'s contracts said that if it bought\\nback bonds, the municipalities had to pay a higher-than-average\\ninterest rate. the new york transportation authority\\'s repayment\\nobligation could eventually balloon by about $12 million a year on\\nthe depfa loans alone.\\n\\non its own, that cost could be absorbed by the agency. but, as\\nthe economy declined, the mta had lost hundreds of millions because\\ntax receipts -- which finance part of its budget -- were falling. and\\nits ability to renew its variable-rate bonds at low interest rates\\nwas hurt by the trouble at depfa and other banks. the\\ntransportation authority now faces a $900 million shortfall,\\naccording to officials.\\n\\nit is \"fairly breathtaking,\" dellaverson told the mta\\'s\\nfinance committee. \"this is not a tolerable long-term position for\\nus to be in.\"\\n\\nin a recent interview, dellaverson defended new york\\'s use of\\nvariable bonds.\\n\\n\"variable-rate debt has helped mta save millions of dollars,\\nand we\\'ve been conservative in issuing it,\" he said. \"but there\\nare risks, which we work hard to mitigate. usually it works. but\\nwhat\\'s happening today is a total lack of marketplace\\nrationality.\"\\n\\nin a statement, the transportation authority said that it was\\nexploring options to reduce the cost of the depfa-backed bonds,\\nthat its variable-rate bonds had delivered savings even during the\\ncurrent turmoil and that the agency had remained within its budget\\non debt payments this year.\\n\\nthe transportation authority has already announced it will raise\\nsubway and train fares next year because of various fiscal\\nproblems, and may be forced to shrink the work force and reduce\\nsome bus routes. some analysts say tolls will probably rise again\\nin 2010.\\n\\nthe depfa fallout doesn\\'t end there. rating agencies have\\ndowngraded the bonds of more than 75 municipal agencies backed by\\ndepfa, including in california, connecticut, illinois and south\\ndakota. officials in florida, massachusetts and montana have cut\\nbudgets because of cdos or similar risky bets.\\n\\nand hypo, the german company that bought depfa, last week asked\\nthe german government for financial help for the third time. depfa\\nhas frozen much of its business, according to wall street bankers,\\nand though it continues to honor its commitments, some wonder for\\nhow long.\\n\\nthe wisconsin school districts have filed suit against the royal\\nbank of canada and stifel nicolaus alleging misrepresentations.\\nboard members hope they will prevail and schools and retirement\\nplans will emerge unscathed. the companies dispute the lawsuit\\'s\\nclaims. noack is not named as a defendant and is cooperating with\\nthe school boards.\\n\\nin velvikis\\' classroom at grewenow elementary in kenosha,\\nstudents have recently completed a lesson in which each\\nfirst-grader contributed a vegetable to a common vat of \"stone\\nsoup.\" the project -- based on a children\\'s book -- teaches the\\nbenefits of working together. the schools have learned that when\\neveryone works together, they can also all starve.\\n\\n\"our funding is already so limited,\" velvikis said. \"we rely\\non parent donations for some supplies. you hear about all these\\nmillions of dollars that have been lost, and you think, that\\'s got\\nto come out of somewhere.\"\\n\\nby midsummer, susan skolfield, a freckled\\nformer actress, had grown a little frustrated with the presidential\\ncampaign of sen. barack obama. despite her pleas, it had no plans\\nto open an office here in her hometown, a traditionally republican\\nsuburb west of orlando.\\n\\nso skolfield opened one herself. she dug into her own pocket for\\nthe initial $1,350 in rent, hooked up telephones and computers,\\nhauled in furniture and printed up fliers for an early september\\nopening party that drew nearly a thousand people.\\n\\neight weeks later, skolfield, 51, who has strawberry-blond hair\\nand a habit of shutting her eyes when she makes a solemn point,\\nspends most of her days hovering at the doorway of her bustling,\\nstill-unofficial obama operation, serving as cheerleader and\\nconcierge to the stream of arrivals.\\n\\nwhen a middle-age woman bursts in, distraught by a news report\\nthat 18-to-24-year-olds are not turning out for early voting --\\n\"should we go to their homes?\" she asked -- skolfield reassures\\nher. an out-of-work roofer appears, explaining he has just walked\\nthree miles to cast the first vote of his lifetime. skolfield and\\nfriends garb him in obama paraphernalia, the clean, bright cottons\\ncontrasting with his tattered clothing. for anyone who completes a\\nround of leafletting, she whoops in appreciation.\\n\\nfor tuesday\\'s election, the obama campaign has created a vast,\\ntechnologically sophisticated get-out-the-vote machine in florida,\\nwith nearly 500 paid staff members and mountains of finely sifted\\nvoter data. the work of skolfield and her hundreds of troops would\\nnot be possible without this infrastructure. many met on the\\ncampaign\\'s social-networking site, and they coordinate with a paid\\nobama field organizer, who provides literature and tells them where\\nto drop it.\\n\\nbut what is most striking is just how much skolfield and her\\noffice of volunteers are doing, even beyond the crucial\\ncampaign-dictated tasks of door knocking and cold calling.\\n\\nbrent constantinides, 24, and jennise

printed, but campaign officials did not send\\nthem, so who had?\\n\\n\"i think santa claus brought them,\" skolfield said.\\n\\nback in june, she attended a three-day session run by the\\ncampaign -- \"me and 199 college students,\" she says -- during which\\nshe was trained, the instructor told her, in the same community\\norganizing techniques obama once used on the streets of chicago.\\nthe first key to success, she was taught, was to polish her own\\nstory. she developed a quick spiel: a former flight attendant and\\nactress, she was raised republican, opposed the iraq war from the\\nstart and became enamored of obama after his 2004 democratic\\nconvention speech.\\n\\nskolfield grew up in winter park, which sprouted up a century\\nago as a destination for vacationing northerners. like many other\\ngirls from white, wealthy families, she was cared for by black\\nservants. now some domestic workers, along with their children,\\nmake up a chunk of her volunteers. but the roles almost seem\\nreversed: skolfield waits on the older black women, offering them\\nbottled water, driving them to the polls or finding others who\\nwill.\\n\\na member of the local historical society, skolfield has been\\nputting together video slideshows about some of their stories: how\\nrose bynum, 83, was not allowed on the white children\\'s playground\\nas a child, how she was refused service at the counter of an\\norlando drugstore.\\n\\nnow bynum\\'s neighborhood, once called colored town, features an\\nobama sign in nearly every yard. when a gaggle of middle-schoolers\\ncrossed the street one day this week, they spotted her lawn sign\\nand whooped in approval. \"gobama, that\\'s how we roll!\" one cried.\\n\\nthough strays have floated in from as far away as massachusetts,\\nthe winter park volunteers are mostly homegrown, which suits the\\nobama campaign\\'s preference for local versus imported volunteers,\\nfor turning its activists first and foremost toward their own\\nfriends, relatives and fellow church members. across florida and\\nthe nation, the campaign is running programs with names like\\nneighbor to neighbor and adopt five, which means see to it that\\nfive sporadic voters get to the polls.\\n\\nthough most polls show a close florida race, and there are still\\nplenty of mccain-palin signs around town, the winter park\\nvolunteers bask in their seeming success. according to skolfield\\'s\\ncontacts at the campaign, her office regularly leads the state in\\nthe daily tallies of doors knocked on, phone calls made and data\\nentered. on the final day of voter registration last month, the\\noffice registered 1,400 people.\\n\\nthough the canvassers hear stray racial epithets, they also hear\\ncheers, even in latino neighborhoods with uncertain levels of obama\\nenthusiasm. and every day, a few more longtime republicans tell the\\ncanvassers they will be voting for obama.\\n\\nthings are so upbeat, in fact, that their two-room office can\\nfeel like an idealized refuge from the real world: it is an\\nintegrated setting in a still-segregated-feeling town, and while\\nthe orlando economy staggers, resources and donations at 200 n.\\ndenning drive flow freely. even the snacks have a labor-of-love\\nfeel. most campaign offices run on store-bought junk food, but the\\nwinter park volunteers grazed on homemade banana-walnut bread and\\nfudge, dropped off by supporters who wanted to help.\\n\\nfor many of the 40 or so core supporters, the place has become\\nsomething of a personal haven. at night, skolfield, who is not\\nmarried, returns home to her mother, an 84-year-old alzheimer\\'s\\npatient, and recounts the latest happenings at the office as her\\nmother looks back uncomprehendingly. recently, her mother had been\\nmaking \"b\" sounds, skolfield said. she knew it couldn\\'t quite be,\\nbut she was hopeful that she was somehow trying to say \"barack.\"\\n\\nconstantinides and belizaire, the couple who keep an obama vigil\\nat the dog run, are out of work, out of money and unsure of how\\nthey will provide for belizaire\\'s 5-year old daughter, ayana. \"all\\nwe know for sure right now is this office and this little booth,\"\\nsaid constantinides, an electrician, his eyes welling. lately some\\nof the motherly types in the office have been hiring him for little\\njobs around their homes. but after the election, the couple is\\nthinking of heading north to look for work.\\n\\ndawson, the volunteer who writes little notes with her leaflets,\\nlives in a prosperous subdivision, lush with lakes and tropical\\nfoliage, but she seems just as lost as to what she will do after\\ntuesday. like the others, she has been living full-time in\\nobamaland for months now.\\n\\n\"we are so worried about what we\\'re going to do after the\\nelection,\" she said, heading off in the sunshine to deposit more\\npackets on her neighbors\\' doorsteps.\\n\\nby midsummer, susan skolfield, a freckled\\nformer actress, had grown a little frustrated with the presidential\\ncampaign of sen. barack obama. despite her pleas, it had no plans\\nto open an office here in her hometown, a traditionally republican\\nsuburb west of orlando.\\n\\nso skolfield opened one herself. she dug into her own pocket for\\nthe initial $1,350 in rent, hooked up telephones and computers,\\nhauled in furniture and printed up fliers for an early september\\nopening party that drew nearly a thousand people.\\n\\neight weeks later, skolfield, 51, who has strawberry-blond hair\\nand a habit of shutting her eyes when she makes a solemn point,\\nspends most of her days hovering at the doorway of her bustling,\\nstill-unofficial obama operation, serving as cheerleader and\\nconcierge to the stream of arrivals.\\n\\nwhen a middle-age woman bursts in, distraught by a news report\\nthat 18- to 24-year-olds are not turning out for early voting --\\n\"should we go to their homes?\" she asked -- skolfield reassures\\nher. an out-of-work roofer appears, explaining he has just walked\\nthree miles to cast the first vote of his lifetime. skolfield and\\nfriends garb him in obama paraphernalia, the clean, bright cottons\\ncontrasting with his tattered clothing. for anyone who completes a\\nround of leafletting, she whoops in appreciation.\\n\\nfor tuesday\\'s election, the obama campaign has created a vast,\\ntechnologically sophisticated get-out-the-vote machine in florida,\\nwith nearly 500 paid staff members and mountains of finely sifted\\nvoter data. the work of skolfield and her hundreds of troops would\\nnot be possible without this infrastructure. many met on the\\ncampaign\\'s social-networking site, and they coordinate with a paid\\nobama field organizer, who provides literature and tells them where\\nto drop it.\\n\\nchicago is bracing for a gigantic crowd this week in\\ngrant park, the city\\'s iconic front yard, where sen. barack obama\\nhas chosen to spend election night.\\n\\nas many as 70,000 people are expected to attend an event for\\nlocal supporters. all available tickets were swept up days ago, and\\nthousands of people have applied to be on a waiting list. thousands\\nmore -- maybe as many as a million people, mayor richard m. daley\\nhas proudly suggested -- are expected to pile into the downtown\\nparkland and sidewalks and streets surrounding obama\\'s official\\ncelebration.\\n\\n\"this could be a moment of history right here, and it\\'s high\\ntime for it,\" said patricia cadagin, who stood last week peering\\nthrough a new fence around the south end of grant park, one of\\nblocks and blocks of fences erected as part of the elaborate\\nsecurity efforts. cadagin, 82, who said she had voted early for\\nobama, will probably not be here on tuesday night. \"it\\'s going to\\nbe a big crowd and at night, and i\\'m a small woman,\" she said.\\n\"will i be here in spirit? you bet you.\"\\n\\nchicago, it seems, is of two minds about this party. many\\nsupporters in obama\\'s hometown speak with pride of the potential of\\nseeing the first black person claim victory in a presidential\\ncampaign here on the edge of lake michigan, in view of their\\nbeloved skyline. still, in hushed tones, some say they are worried\\nabout his safety in the public park and about how a huge crowd in\\nthis city, which has seen violence after events like basketball\\nchampionships, might respond, win, lose or draw.\\n\\neven city leaders have sent mixed messages. on thursday, daley,\\na fierce obama supporter, seemed to suggest the more the merrier.\\n\"you think i\\'m not going to invite people down?\" he told\\nreporters, according to the chicago tribune. \"this is a\\ncelebration.\"\\n\\na day later, city leaders cautioned chicagoans to behave\\nproperly, warned them that people might be turned away if grant\\npark became too crowded and stood at a city-run news conference\\nbeside ministers who suggested that those without tickets use\\n\"common sense\" and stay in their own neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"we can\\'t have foolishness,\" said the police superintendent,\\njody p. weis. \"we can\\'t have mischief.\"\\n\\ngrant park, known as lake park until it was renamed for ulysses\\ns. grant in 1901, lies not far from the route of abraham lincoln\\'s\\nfuneral procession, was the home of at least four political\\nconventions in the late 1800s, was visited by queen elizabeth ii in\\n1959, was the site of a clash between the police and anti-war\\nprotesters during the democratic convention in 1968, and was the\\nplace where pope john paul ii celebrated mass with thousands in\\n1979. the park is home to the annual taste of chicago, as well as\\ngames of 16-inch softball played by generations of chicagoans.\\n\\n\"you couldn\\'t have a place more infused with chicago and more\\ninfused with everything that chicago has experienced,\" said the\\ncity\\'s cultural historian, tim samuelson, who noted that parts of\\nthe park were probably built on debris left behind from the great\\nchicago fire of 1871.\\n\\nas obama supporters searched for tickets on craigslist and in\\nother places (though it is unclear whether the free tickets are\\ntransferable and campaign officials say identification will be\\nchecked), federal and local law enforcement officials revealed\\nlittle about their security plans but made it clear that they were\\nextensive.\\n\\nthe city has kept on a special security chief it had hired in\\ncase the white sox or the cubs made it to the world series. no\\nsworn chicago police officers will have tuesday night off.\\nfirefighters were told to take their gear home so they could\\nrespond quickly if called. some of the city\\'s largest thoroughfares\\nand some boat harbors will close. and parking will be banned\\nthrough large areas of downtown.\\n\\nlast week, officials could be seen touring rooftops in downtown\\nhigh-rises as helicopters flew over hutchinson field, the section\\nof grant park where the obama event will be held. some downtown\\noffices have been asked to send employees home early tuesday.\\n\\nfence companies, meanwhile, appeared to be certain winners, as\\nfences and barricades rose all around.\\n\\nlocal and federal law enforcement officials said repeatedly that\\nthey were confident they could keep the event safe, even outside,\\neven with uncertain crowd numbers. \"we\\'re concerned about every\\nvenue,\" said ed donovan, a spokesman for the secret service. \"we\\ndo this for a living.\"\\n\\nthe obama campaign declined to discuss the cost of the event,\\nbut city officials have suggested that the campaign might spend $2\\nmillion on extra city services for the evening. in discouraging\\nthose without tickets from going downtown, city officials and\\nministers described somewhat stark conditions at the official\\nparty: no chairs, no alcohol (though hot chocolate is expected), no\\nbags allowed, and uncertain weather given the month and the town.\\n\\n\"it\\'s taken us a long time to get to where we are,\" said the\\nrev. albert tyson, one of several ministers who called for calm.\\n\"we are on the precipice of the most historic event that this\\nunited states has ever seen. we certainly want to counsel folks all\\nover the city not to do anything to mar this event.\"\\n\\nsusan o\\'halloran, 58, who has volunteered for the obama\\ncampaign, is among those who will have a ticket on tuesday night.\\nshe was also in grant park 40 years ago, as a high school senior\\nwho had joined others to oppose the vietnam war during the\\ndemocratic convention. she said she had been eating, relaxing and\\ntalking during the protest when police officers grew tense, pulling\\nbilly clubs from their belts. one chased her, apparently because\\nshe had a super 8 movie camera, she said, and she fled; other\\ndemonstrators were later beaten, an event o\\'halloran considers a\\nscar on the city.\\n\\n\"i will be back on that field,\" o\\'halloran said. \"and i don\\'t\\ncare how cold it is or how long i have to wait. it feels too\\nhistoric.\"\\n\\nshe said the possibility that obama would be elected was \"all\\npart of the same thing\" she was fighting for in the 1960s. \"my\\nreason for being there as a young woman was because there was\\nsomething i wanted to see this country become. that\\'ll be the same\\nreason i\\'m down there tuesday night,\" she said, her voice\\nbreaking. \"the full circle is pretty luscious.\"\\n\\nbrightly colored lines of washing hang\\nby the gray stone walls. a vendor offers sunglasses, shampoo and\\ncigarettes from a plastic sheet under a tree. a man with a polaroid\\ncamera sells souvenir photos to the cambodian soldiers camped on\\nthe temple grounds.\\n\\nat the main gate, where an hourlong firefight with thai troops\\nbroke out less than three weeks ago, the commander of a cambodian\\nborder police unit is playing cards with his men.\\n\\nit is a sleepy interlude here at the preah vihear temple, on the\\nthai-cambodian border, where this summer a dispute over sovereignty\\nbecame the most volatile international confrontation in indochina\\nin 20 years.\\n\\ncambodian troops occupy the swooping cliff-top temple, which is\\nin cambodia but is most easily reached from the high ground on the\\nthai side. the thais, who claim parts of the territory around the\\ntemple, are mostly out of sight in the hills or in camps nearby in\\nthailand.\\n\\nbut the cambodian government seems to be digging in for a long\\nsiege. a new budget expected to be approved in the coming week\\nwould double the country\\'s military budget to $500 million -- or 25\\npercent of all government spending.\\n\\n\"we cannot sit and watch thai troops encroach on our border,\"\\ncheam yeap, deputy head of the finance commission of the national\\nassembly, was quoted by reuters as having said. \"our army needs to\\nbe more organized, better trained, with newer bases and well-fed\\ntroops.\"\\n\\nthe encampment here has the village feel of cambodian\\ndeployments throughout conflicts in recent decades.\\n\\na small market has opened under red and blue tarpaulins; a\\nbarber has put out his chair by a temple wall; a satellite dish\\nbrings in both thai and cambodian soap operas for the officers to\\nwatch.\\n\\nsoldiers calling their families wander the cliff\\'s edge\\nsearching for a cell phone signal, which switches between thai and\\ncambodian carriers as they walk.\\n\\nat the bottom of the great stone causeway, giant loops of silver\\nrazor wire close off the main entrance, which is guarded by armed\\nmen wearing sandals; the 900-year-old temple, with its sagging\\nwalls and tumbling columns, is empty of tourists.\\n\\nthe commander of the forces here, gen. chea dara -- a man who\\nlooks to be in his 50s and wore a white tank top along with his\\ngold wristwatch, and held a dripping red dragon fruit -- claimed a\\ngreat victory in the little skirmish that took place oct. 15.\\n\\n\"they left with their hands in the air!\" he said of a group of\\n10 thai soldiers whom the cambodians captured and returned. he\\nraised his arms and shook them, adding: \"they were trembling! they\\nthought we would kill them.\"\\n\\nother tales are told on the thai side, and the origins and\\noutcome of the clash remain unclear. soldiers here say that three\\ncambodian soldiers died, two by gunfire and one from a heart\\nattack. the thais admit to one death and several wounded.\\n\\ntiny marks of shrapnel fleck the great stone staircase that\\nrises from the thai side to the temple, along with two stone\\ndragons that flank the steps. but nothing seems to have been gained\\nor lost in the fighting.\\n\\nthe dispute flared in july, when unesco, the cultural agency of\\nthe united nations, declared the temple a world heritage site,\\nbased on a cambodian government proposal. domestic politics in\\nthailand fueled a nationalist response, and troops, artillery and\\ntanks were moved into position.\\n\\nthe confrontation echoes with the history of the rise and\\nretreat of empires over the centuries, and old fears and hatreds\\nstill burn between cambodia and its more powerful neighbors,\\nvietnam and thailand.\\n\\nthe dispute also draws together the tangled strands of more\\nrecent conflicts, with roots in the vietnam war and the brutal\\ndecades of massacres and civil war involving the khmer rouge of\\ncambodia.\\n\\none chinese-made 85-millimeter artillery piece at the lip of the\\nprecipice was brought to cambodia by invading vietnamese soldiers\\nin 1980, and it may have been used against american troops a few\\nyears before that. since then, both khmer rouge and government\\nsoldiers have fired it as control of preah vihear changed hands.\\n\\nafter the cambodian civil war ended a decade ago, the khmer\\nrouge were integrated into the government army, and the combined\\nforce is facing off now against thailand.\\n\\nthe thais, armed and equipped mostly with american weaponry,\\nhave the advantage in firepower as well as air cover from fighter\\njets. their 300,000-strong military is three times the size of the\\ncambodian armed forces.\\n\\nbut the cambodians, with their more tormented history, are more\\nhardened soldiers. some of them have fought on one side or another\\n-- or on more than one -- since they were boys in the 1960s.\\n\\n\"they wanted to test us, to see if cambodian troops are easy to\\nintimidate,\" said col. meas yoeun, 48, a ranking commander in\\npreah vihear province.\\n\\n\"they curse us and mock us and look down on us,\" he said of\\nthe thai soldiers. \"they say we have old weapons and ask us if\\nthey really fire.\"\\n\\naccording to the cambodian soldiers camped here, the oct. 15\\nbattle began with taunts as thai troops across a small stream\\nshouted at them, \"come on, let\\'s fight!\"\\n\\ntouch socheat, 39, a captain in the border police, said he had\\ncome to know some of the thai soldiers by name over the weeks as\\nthey called back and forth, and he felt betrayed when they started\\nshooting.\\n\\n\"one guy got hit right over here as he was taking a bath,\" he\\nsaid, pointing to an open pump. \"i\\'m not going to trust them\\nanymore.\"\\n\\nsrum mao, 45, a deputy post commander for the border police,\\nsaid the two sides were keeping a close eye on each other now,\\nwaiting for some new surprise.\\n\\n\"we watch what they do,\" he said. \"when they carry\\nammunition, we carry ammunition. when they dig a bunker, we dig a\\nbunker. when they put down their

to\\nsome of the first local and state pollution control laws, and,\\neventually, the 1970 federal clean air act.\\n\\n\"we want people to realize donora was a big part of the\\nenvironmental movement,\" said don pavelko, a donora councilman who\\ncame up with the idea for the museum. \"the smog in donora over the\\nyears had been looked upon as a black eye. the older folks just\\ndidn\\'t want to talk about it, because they thought it was bad\\npublicity.\"\\n\\nthe museum, in a former chinese restaurant, brings together\\nphotographs, old newspapers, maps and copies of studies of

then,\\nremembered going to work at the mill that saturday.\\n\\n\"we all thought it would lift eventually, because we were used\\nto the fog in the valley,\" he said. \"then i started to hear about\\npeople getting sick.\"\\n\\nsmog was not unusual in donora, a town of 14,000 then that was\\nhome to the american steel &amp;amp; wire co. and the donora zinc works\\nplants -- both run by the u.s. steel co. -- that sat along the river\\nand employed 5,000 people.\\n\\nbut this was different. the thick, yellowish, acrid smog was the\\nresult of an unusual weather inversion -- a pocket of warm, stagnant\\nair -- that sat over the valley for five days.\\n\\nunderneath what was essentially a lid on the valley were\\nsulfuric acid, nitrogen dioxide and other poisonous gases,\\nincluding fluorine, that would normally rise into the atmosphere.\\nmost researchers blame the zinc plant, which had long been a source\\nof complaints and was responsible for the denuding of almost all\\nvegetation within a half-mile of the plant.\\n\\nthe actual toll from the smog has never been accurately\\ncalculated. davis said donora\\'s mortality rate remained high for\\nyears

barack obama\\'s surge in the polls was so strong he was\\ncompetitive in mccain\\'s home state, arizona. the everyman hero of\\nmccain\\'s campaign, \"joe the plumber,\" failed to make an expected\\nappearance at a morning rally in defiance, ohio, and the senator\\'s\\nefforts to highlight obama\\'s association with a professor tied to\\nthe plo were amounting to nothing.\\n\\nwait a minute ... not so fast. click.\\n\\nthings were looking up for mccain, the fox news channel hosts\\nsean hannity and greta van susteren told their viewers at roughly\\nthe same time thursday. he got a boost at an afternoon rally in\\nsandusky, ohio, from none other than joe the plumber, who announced\\nhis intention to vote for \"a real american, john mccain\"; he was\\ngaining new ground in ever-tightening polls, despite the\\noverwhelming bias against him in the mainstream news media; and\\nobama\\'s association with a professor sympathetic to the plo was now\\nat \"the center of the election.\"\\n\\non any given night, there are two distinctly, even extremely,\\ndifferent views of the presidential campaign offered on two of the\\nthree big cable news networks, fox news channel and msnbc, a dual\\nreality that is reflected on the internet as well.\\n\\non one, polls that are \"tightening\" are emphasized over those\\nthat are not, and the rest of the news media is portrayed as\\npapering over questions about obama\\'s past associations with people\\nwho have purportedly anti-american tendencies, which he has not\\nanswered. (\"i feel like we are talking to the germans after hitler\\ncomes to power, saying, \\'oh, well, i didn\\'t know,\"\\' ann coulter,\\nthe conservative commentator, told hannity on thursday.)\\n\\non the other, polls that show tightening are largely ignored,\\nand the race is cast as one between an angry and erratic mccain,\\nwhose desperate, misleading campaign has as low as a 4 percent\\nchance of beating a cool, confident and deserving democratic\\nnominee. (\"he\\'s been a good father, a good citizen; he\\'s paid\\nattention to his country,\" chris matthews, the msnbc host, said\\nwednesday night in addressing those who might be leaning against\\nobama based on race. \"give the guy a break and think about voting\\nfor him.\")\\n\\nand, perhaps unsurprisingly, each campaign is often at war\\nagainst its television antagonist, just as the networks are at war\\nwith each other.\\n\\nit is a political division of news that harks back to the way\\namerican journalism was through the first half of the 20th century,\\nwhen newspapers had more open political affiliations. but it has\\nnever been so apparent in such a clear-cut way on television, a\\nresult of market forces and partisan sensibilities that are further\\nchipping away at the post-watergate pre-eminence of a more\\ndispassionate approach.\\n\\nthe more objective approach came as the corporate owners of the\\nnetworks pushed for higher profits and the newspaper industry\\nconsolidated and sought broader audiences. \"to sell as many copies\\nas you could to as many people as you could, you became what we\\nconsidered objective,\" said richard wald, a professor of media and\\nsociety at columbia university school of journalism and a former,\\nsenior vice president at abc news.\\n\\nfox news channel was founded 12 years ago with an argument that\\nthe mainstream news media were biased toward liberals and that\\nnonliberals were starved for a \"fair and balanced\" television\\nantidote by day and openly conservative-leaning opinion by night.\\nbut it was only in the last couple of years that msnbc, long\\nstruggling for an identity and lagging, established itself as a\\nliberal alternative to fox news channel in prime time, finding\\nimproved ratings in the mistrust of the mainstream media that had\\ngrown among those on the left during the bush years and the iraq\\nwar.\\n\\nthe presidential campaign, and the partisan and ideological\\nintensity surrounding it, has been the perfect subject for both\\nsides, providing endless fodder to play to the persuasions of their\\naudience and mock the views expressed on the rival network.\\n\\nthe result is a return to a \"great tradition of american\\njournalism,\" wald said. \"basically you chose your news outlet if\\nit made you happy, if it reinforced all your views.\"\\n\\nindeed, voters who primarily get their news from web sites like\\nthe huffington post by day and msnbc by night, and those who\\nprimarily get theirs from the drudge report by day and fox news\\nchannel by night would have entirely different views of the\\ncandidates and the news driving the campaign year. (at second place\\nin the ratings, behind fox news channel, cnn is maintaining a far\\nmore traditional approach to news this year.)\\n\\nwhen politico.com reported oct. 21 that the republican national\\ncommittee had spent $150,000 on clothing for gov. sarah palin of\\nalaska, olbermann interrupted his 8 p.m. program on msnbc to\\npromote the story and discuss it, as did rachel maddow, whose\\nprogram follows.\\n\\nfox news channel reported it first the next morning, on \"fox &amp;amp;\\nfriends\" in a segment in which the report was described as sexist\\nand unfair, and bill o\\'reilly and van susteren, later criticized\\nthe news media on their programs for giving it as much attention as\\nthey had.\\n\\n\"it was ridiculous,\" o\\'reilly said, singling out the new york\\ntimes in particular for covering the purchase.\\n\\nthat was a role reversal from may 2007, when news broke that\\nformer sen. john edwards had paid $400 for a haircut out of his\\ndemocratic presidential campaign account.\\n\\nolbermann named hannity the \"worst person in the world,\" a\\nrunning feature on his program, for making fun of edwards\\' haircut\\nand showing video of him styling his hair before an interview.\\n\\no\\'reilly had said of edwards at the time: \"he runs around\\ntelling americans the system is rigged, while paying $400 for a\\nhaircut. this guy is a one-man sitcom.\"\\n\\ntom rosenstiel, director of the project for excellence in\\njournalism at the pew research center, said, \"to some extent, they\\nare reverse images of each other.\"\\n\\nthe group has studied the tone and content of the election-year\\ncoverage and found that mccain has been the subject of more\\nnegative reports in general than has obama on issues that include\\nassessments of their performances in polls, the debates and running\\ntheir campaigns.\\n\\nbut within that universe, the study found, the number of\\npositive reports on mccain at fox news was above the average of the\\nnews media at large, and the number of negative reports about obama\\nwas higher, too. (the study found that the mix of positive and\\nnegative was roughly equal for them on fox.)\\n\\nand the study found that msnbc featured more negative reports\\nabout mccain than the rest of the news media and more positive\\nreports about obama. cnn was more generally in line with the\\naverage.\\n\\nrosenstiel said fox news channel and msnbc showed ideological\\ndifferences, \"obviously more so at night.\" and executives at\\nthose networks said that opinion was kept to their prime-time\\nlineups and away from their news reporting.\\n\\nofficials at the obama and mccain campaigns said in interviews\\nlast week that they believed they were treated fairly by the\\nreporters assigned to them at the two networks, including major\\ngarrett and carl cameron at fox news channel and kelly o\\'donnell\\nand lee cowan at nbc news. (nbc pools some political newsgathering\\nefforts with the new york times.) and advisers to both campaigns\\nshow up for interviews on both networks.\\n\\nobama\\'s campaign aides said they were pleased when shepard\\nsmith, the fox news channel anchor, this week dressed down joe the\\nplumber, aka samuel j. wurzelbacher, for agreeing with a voter who\\ncalled a vote for obama \"a vote for the death of israel.\"\\n\\nreporting that obama supported israel, smith added with\\nexasperation, \"it just gets frightening sometimes.\"\\n\\nand maddow is chilly toward obama\\'s position that he would\\nattack sites inside pakistan without permission from pakistan\\'s\\ngovernment if there were an opportunity to go after terrorists.\\n\\nbut officials at both campaigns also said there had been plenty\\nof instances when they have perceived bias in regular news\\ncoverage. on fox news channel, for instance, greg palkot, referring\\nto obama, asked a guest, \"do economists say that in fact his\\npolicies could drive a recession into a depression?\" (the guest,\\ndonald lambro of the washington times, responded, \"well, i haven\\'t\\nread that, no.\")\\n\\nraising a report about obama campaign suspicions that mccain got\\nan unfair peek at questions to be asked of him at a joint forum at\\nthe saddleback church, mccain\\'s campaign wrote to nbc news in\\naugust, \"we are concerned that your news division is following\\nmsnbc\\'s lead in abandoning nonpartisan coverage of the presidential\\nrace.\"\\n\\nand sometimes the approaches have been noticeable simply through\\nwhat the networks cover. after npr reported late last week that a\\nmccain supporter, former secretary of state lawrence eagleburger,\\nquestioned whether palin was \"prepared to take the reins of the\\npresidency,\" msnbc mentioned it roughly 20 times over the course\\nof the day; cnn mentioned it four times; and fox news channel did\\none segment, in which it interviewed eagleburger, who apologized\\nand said palin was \"a quick study.\"\\n\\nfox news channel executives would not comment for this article.\\nphil griffin, president of msnbc, agreed that at night his network\\ngives a decidedly opinionated viewpoint.\\n\\n\"all of our material is based on fact -- our guys work really\\nhard on it, and the point-of-view shows make their conclusions,\"\\ngriffin said. \"in this modern era, you\\'ve got a variety of places\\nthat look at the day\\'s events. some you respect more than others,\\nothers you recognize as having a point of view, some you see as\\nfactual in a

aires, a federal\\njury here remains undecided about the role of a venezuelan\\nbusinessman.\\n\\nthe businessman, franklin duran, is charged with conspiracy and\\nwith operating in the united states as an unauthorized agent of a\\nforeign government.\\n\\nprosecutors say duran, who owns a house in the miami area, came\\nto the united states at the behest of the venezuelan government to\\ncoerce a friend to conceal the source and destination of an\\n$800,000 cash contribution to the 2007 campaign of an argentine\\npresidential candidate, cristina fernandez de kirchner, who went on\\nto win the election.\\n\\njurors have deliberated for seven days but remain deadlocked.\\nearlier this week they sent a note to judge joan a. lenard saying\\nthey were at an impasse.\\n\\nlenard instructed them to continue deliberating.\\n\\nboth kirchner and her venezuelan counterpart, president hugo\\nchavez, have denied any role in the matter, which has made\\nheadlines in latin america.\\n\\nthe jury\\'s impasse has prompted some venezuelans to speculate in\\nnews blogs and internet chat rooms that the chavez administration\\nis somehow manipulating the jury to prevent a guilty verdict.\\n\\n\"if he is found guilty, those that are anti-chavez will be\\nhappy,\" said laura weffer, an investigative reporter for the\\nleading venezuelan newspaper el nacional, who has covered the duran\\ntrial from its inception in september. \"but if there is a\\nmistrial, they will say he bought the jurors.\"\\n\\namong those testifying at the trial was maria lujan telpuk, the\\nformer argentine police officer who discovered the money-laden\\nsuitcase in the airport in buenos aires and later capitalized on\\nher fame by posing naked for the latin american edition of playboy\\nmagazine.\\n\\nduring the trial, prosecutors also played secretly recorded\\nphone conversations between duran and others.\\n\\namong the conservations recorded by the fbi were those between\\nduran and his friend guido alejandro antonini wilson, who was\\ncarrying the suitcase, filled with $800,000 in $50 bills, when he\\nwas stopped aug. 4, 2007.\\n\\nstripped of the money, wilson returned to south florida, where\\nhe has a home, and approached the fbi to become a witness for the\\nagency. wilson was paid $30,000 by the bureau for his services,\\naccording to testimony at the trial.\\n\\nduran\\'s lawyers contend that he became involved in the case to\\nhelp wilson, and not at the behest of chavez or venezuelan\\nintelligence.\\n\\n\"everything franklin duran did, he did for himself, and for his\\nbest friend in the world, alejandro antonini,\" ed shohat, duran\\'s\\nlawyer, said in his closing remarks last week.\\n\\n\"just because the venezuelan government wants the same thing,\"\\nhe added, \"doesn\\'t mean franklin duran is working as an agent of\\nthe venezuelan government.\"\\n\\nshohat had said u.s. prosecutors pursued the case to try to\\nembarrass chavez and his government.\\n\\nthree other men have pleaded guilty to their roles in trying to\\ncover up the affair. two of the men testified on behalf of the\\nprosecution.\\n\\ndeliberations could continue until

day.\\n\\nmany of the mug shots of drug traffickers that\\nappear in the mexican press show surly looking roughnecks glaring\\nmenacingly at the camera. an anti-corruption investigation unveiled\\nlast week in the mexican capital, however, made it clear that not\\neverybody enmeshed in the narcotics trade looked the part.\\n\\nthere was a gray-haired, grandfatherly type who was pushing 70,\\nas well as an avuncular figure with a neatly styled goatee and\\nwire-rimmed spectacles perched upon his nose. some of the five men\\nwho found themselves on the front pages of newspapers on their way\\nto jail, wore suits, which made them look more like bureaucrats\\nthan bad guys.\\n\\namong the greatest challenges in mexico\\'s drug war is the fact\\nthat the traffickers fit no type. their ranks include men and\\nwomen, the young and the old. and they can work anywhere: in remote\\ndrug labs, as part of roving assassination squads, even within the\\nupper reaches of the government.\\n\\nit has long been known that drug gangs have infiltrated local\\npolice forces. now it is becoming ever more clear that the problem\\ndoes not stop there. the alarming reality is that many public\\nservants in mexico are serving both the taxpayers and the\\ntraffickers.\\n\\nthe men in suits, it turns out, were both bureaucrats and bad\\nguys, corrupt officials high up in an elite unit of the federal\\nattorney general\\'s office who were feeding secret information to\\nthe feared beltran leyva cartel in exchange for suitcases full of\\ncash.\\n\\ntheir arrest, and the firing of 35 other suspect law-enforcement\\nofficials, represents the most extensive corruption case that this\\ncountry, which knows corruption all too well, has ever seen. and it\\nraises a question that is on the lips of many mexicans: how does\\none know who is dirty and who is clean?\\n\\n\"i\\'m convinced that to stop the crime, we first have to get it\\nout of our own house,\" president felipe calderon, who has made\\nfighting trafficking a crucial part of his presidency, said in a\\nspeech tuesday, after the arrests were announced.\\n\\nthat house is clearly dirty. there is ample evidence that\\nmexicans of all walks of life are willing to join the drug gangs in\\nexchange for cash, including the farmers who abandon traditional\\ncrops and turn to growing marijuana and the accountants who hide\\nthe narco-traffickers\\' profits.\\n\\nthere was sporadic evidence in the past that such corruption\\nextended into high-level government offices. an army general who\\ncommanded mexico\\'s anti-drug unit was arrested and convicted in\\n1997 after the discovery that he was working for a drug lord on the\\nside. in 2005, a spy working for a drug cartel was discovered\\nworking in the president\\'s office and accused of feeding\\ntraffickers information on the movements of vicente fox, then the\\npresident.\\n\\nbut the abundance of law enforcement officials now believed to\\nbe on the take has made calderon\\'s drug war all the more difficult\\nto execute. traffickers often know beforehand when raids are going\\nto occur. sometimes dealers plant their people on the teams that\\ncarry out the raids to act as saboteurs.\\n\\nthe traffickers\\' networks are not foolproof. calderon\\'s\\ngovernment did manage to capture alfredo beltran leyva, a cartel\\nleader, in january even though the group was receiving inside\\ninformation. what appears to have happened, officials say, is that\\nthe army carried out the raid without involving the attorney\\ngeneral\\'s office, inadvertently keeping the corrupt officials out\\nof the loop.\\n\\nthe cartel\\'s leaders, who operate out of sinaloa state and have\\nbeen implicated in the killing of a top police commander in mexico\\ncity, were described in local press accounts as being furious that\\ntheir government moles had not informed them of the raid.\\n\\nstill, the reach of the drug networks is so extensive that even\\nwinning a court conviction against a kingpin is not always enough\\nto claim victory.\\n\\nmany prison wardens and guards have shown themselves to be\\ncorrupt, allowing prominent detainees not only to operate their\\ncrime networks from their cells, but also to use their illicit drug\\nproceeds to be as comfortable as possible behind bars, paying for\\neverything from pizza to prostitutes. the cartel leaders sometimes\\neven use their money to escape. the most notorious case was in\\n2001, when joaquin guzman loera, the country\\'s most wanted drug\\nlord, managed to slip out of a maximum security prison in a laundry\\ncart.\\n\\nthe porous nature of mexican penitentiaries has prompted\\ncalderon to increase the number of transfers of drug lords to the\\nu.s. prison system. the united states has already filed the\\npaperwork to extradite one of the officials accused last week of\\ncorruption. the official, miguel colorado gonzalez, 68, was a top\\nmanager in the government organized-crime office known by the\\nspanish acronym siedo.\\n\\ncalderon is not the first president to try to root out\\ncorruption. president ernesto zedillo reorganized the nation\\'s\\nfederal police at least twice; each time traffickers quickly\\ninfiltrated the force and bought off leading officials. his\\nsuccessor, fox, tried and failed to clean up law enforcement as\\nwell.\\n\\ncalderon\\'s efforts have been sustained enough that the\\ntraffickers have begun a vicious counterattack; so far this year,\\nnearly 4,000 people -- including police officers, soldiers,\\ncriminals and civilians -- have been killed in an extraordinary wave\\nof violence linked to organized crime.\\n\\nthe latest corruption scandal has prompted calderon\\'s attorney\\ngeneral to order a restructuring and purging of his office, and\\nspecifically of siedo, which was formed from another agency that\\nwas shut down after being infiltrated by drug spies.\\n\\nthe government has ordered more lie-detector tests for officials\\nin delicate posts, beefed-up background checks and better salaries\\nfor underpaid police officers. but the amount of cash that the\\ntraffickers throw around -- which jorge chabat, a security analyst,\\ncalls \"enough money to buy part of the state\" -- makes government\\nsalaries seem laughable. clearly, the government cannot compete\\npeso for peso.\\n\\nin some cases, finding out who has strayed from the straight and\\nnarrow should be a simple matter of following the money. colorado\\ngonzalez is reported to have bought four luxury vehicles in one\\nyear. expensive jewelry was found in his home. his bank account was\\nbulging.\\n\\nin tuesday\\'s speech, a clearly frustrated calderon said the\\nfight to clean up mexico depended on citizens putting their country\\nfirst and respecting the law above all else. he suggested that the\\nsmall bribes so often demanded by the officer on the beat, and\\naccepted by the public as normal, for infractions real and\\nimagined, were not disconnected from the government official\\nreceiving millions of dollars in drug profits.\\n\\n\"we need a stronger society, a society that lives the principle\\nof legality with conviction, that encourages, promotes, spreads and\\neducates its children with values,\" calderon said. in other words,\\nthere has to be a line people will not cross, even for a suitcase\\nfull of cash.\\n\\nand so: just how far have we come?\\n\\nas a rough gauge last week, i watched a movie i hadn\\'t seen\\nsince it came out when i was a teenager in 1967. back then, \"guess\\nwho\\'s coming to dinner\" was hollywood\\'s idea of a stirring call\\nfor racial justice. the premise: a young white woman falls madly in\\nlove with a black man while visiting the university of hawaii and\\nbrings him home to san francisco to get her parents\\' blessing. dad,\\na crusading newspaper publisher, and mom, a modern art dealer, are\\nwealthy white liberals -- katharine hepburn and spencer tracy, no\\nless -- so surely there can be no problem. complications ensue\\nbefore everyone does the right thing.\\n\\nthough the film was a box-office smash and received 10 oscar\\nnominations, even four decades ago it was widely ridiculed as dated\\nby liberal critics. the hero, played by the first black hollywood\\nsuperstar, sidney poitier, was seen as too perfect and too\\n\"white\" -- an impossibly handsome doctor with johns hopkins and\\nyale on his resume and a nobel-worthy career fighting tropical\\ndiseases in africa for the world health organization. what couple\\nwould not want him as a son-in-law? \"he\\'s so calm and sure of\\neverything,\" says his fiancee. \"he doesn\\'t have any tensions in\\nhim.\" she is confident that every single one of their biracial\\nchildren will grow up to \"be president of the united states, and\\nthey\\'ll all have colorful administrations.\"\\n\\nwhat a strange movie to confront in 2008. as the world knows,\\nbarack obama\\'s own white mother and african father met at the\\nuniversity of hawaii. in \"dreams from my father,\" he even\\nimagines the awkward dinner where his mother introduced her\\nliberal-ish parents to her intended in 1959. but what\\'s most\\nstartling about this archaic film is the sole element in it that\\nproves inadvertently contemporary. faced with a black man in the\\nmold of the poitier character -- one who appears \"so calm\" and\\nwithout \"tensions\" -- white liberals can make utter fools of\\nthemselves. when joe biden spoke of obama being \"clean\" and\\n\"articulate,\" he might have been recycling spencer tracy\\'s lines\\nof 41 years ago.\\n\\nbiden\\'s gaffe, though particularly naked, prefigured a larger\\npattern in the extraordinary election campaign that has brought an\\nafrican-american to the brink of the presidency. our political and\\nnews media establishments -- fixated for months on tracking down\\nevery unreconstructed bigot in blue-collar america -- have their own\\nconspicuous racial myopia, with its own set of stereotypes and\\ncliches. they consistently underestimated obama\\'s candidacy because\\nthey often saw him as a stand-in for the two-dimensional character\\npoitier had to shoulder in \"guess who\\'s coming to dinner.\" it\\'s\\nwhy so many got this election wrong so often.\\n\\nthere were countless ruminations, in print and on television,\\nasking the same two rhetorical questions: \"is he black enough?\"\\nand \"is he tough enough?\" the implied answer to both was usually,\\n\"no.\" the brown-skinned child of biracial parents wasn\\'t really\\n\"black\" and wouldn\\'t appeal to black voters who were\\noverwhelmingly loyal to the wife of america\\'s first \"black\"\\npresident. and as a former constitutional law professor, obama was\\nundoubtedly too lofty an intellectual to be a political street\\nfighter, too much of a wuss to land a punch in a debate, too\\nethereal to connect to \"real\" americans. he was adlai stevenson,\\nmichael dukakis or bill bradley in dark face -- no populist pugilist\\nlike john edwards.\\n\\nthe list of mistaken prognostications that grew from these\\nflawed premises is long. as primary season began, we were\\nrepeatedly told that hillary clinton\\'s campaign was the most\\nbattle-tested and disciplined, with an invincible organization and\\nan unbeatable donors\\' network. poor obama had to settle for the\\nineffectual passion of the starry-eyed, internet-fixated college\\nkids who failed to elect howard dean in 2004. when clinton lost in\\niowa, no matter; obama could never breach the \"firewalls\" that\\nwould wrap up her nomination by super tuesday. neither the clinton\\ncampaign nor the many who bought its spin noticed the\\ntake-no-prisoners political insurgency that obama had built\\nthroughout the caucus states and that serves him to this day.\\n\\nonce obama wrested the nomination from clinton by surpassing her\\nin organization, cash and black votes, he was still often seen as\\ntoo wimpy to take on the republicans. this prognosis was codified\\nby karl rove, whose punditry for the wall street journal and\\nnewsweek has been second only to jon stewart and stephen colbert as\\na reliable source of laughs this year. rove called obama \"lazy,\"\\nand over the summer he predicted that his fundraising had peaked in\\nfebruary and that he\\'d have a \"serious problem\" winning over\\nhispanics. well, obama was lazy like a fox, and is leading john\\nmccain among hispanics by 2 to 1. obama has also pulled ahead among\\nwhite women despite the widespread predictions that he\\'d never\\nbring furious hillary supporters into the fold.\\n\\nbut certainly the single most revelatory moment of the campaign\\n-- about the political establishment, not obama -- arrived in june\\nwhen he reversed his position on taking public financing. this was\\na huge flip-flop (if no bigger than mccain\\'s on the bush tax cuts).\\nbut the reaction was priceless. suddenly the political world\\ndiscovered that far from being some exotic hothouse flower, obama\\nwas a pol from chicago. up until then, it rarely occurred to anyone\\nthat he had to be a ruthless competitor, not merely a sweet-talking\\norator, to reach the top of a political machine even rougher than\\nthe clinton machine he had brought down. whether that makes him\\nmore black or more white remains unresolved.\\n\\nearly in the campaign, the black commentator tavis smiley took a\\nlot of heat when he questioned all the rhetoric, much of it from\\nwhite liberals, about obama being \"post-racial.\" smiley pointed\\nout that there is \"no such thing in america as race\\ntranscendence.\" he is right, of course. america can no sooner\\ndisown its racial legacy, starting with the original sin of\\nslavery, than it can disown its flag; it\\'s built into our dna.\\nobama acknowledged as much in his landmark speech on race in\\nphiladelphia in march.\\n\\nyet much has changed for the better since the era of \"guess\\nwho\\'s coming to dinner,\" thanks to the epic battles of the\\ncivil-rights movement that have made the obama phenomenon possible.\\nas mark harris reminds us in his recent book about late-1960s\\nhollywood, \"pictures at a revolution,\" it was not until the year\\nof the movie\\'s release that the warren court handed down the loving\\ndecision overturning laws that forbade interracial marriage in 16\\nstates; in the film\\'s final cut there\\'s still an outdated line\\nreferring to the possibility that the young couple\\'s nuptials could\\nbe illegal (as obama\\'s parents\\' marriage would have been in, say,\\nvirginia). in that same year of 1967, lbj\\'s secretary of state,\\ndean rusk, offered his resignation when his daughter, a stanford\\nstudent, announced her engagement to a black georgetown grad\\nworking at nasa. (johnson didn\\'t accept it.)\\n\\nobama\\'s message and genealogy alike embody what has changed in\\nthe decades since. when he speaks of red and blue america being\\nseamlessly woven into the united states of america, it is always\\nshorthand for the reconciliation of black and white and brown and\\nyellow america as well. demographically, that\\'s where america is\\nheading in the new century, and that will be its destiny no matter\\nwho wins the election this year.\\n\\nstill, the country isn\\'t there yet, and should obama be elected,\\namerica will not be cleansed of its racial history or conflicts. it\\nwill still have a virtually all-white party as one of its two most\\npowerful political organizations. there will still be white\\nliberals who look at obama and can\\'t quite figure out what to make\\nof his complex mixture of idealism and hard-knuckled political\\ncunning, of his twin identities of international sojourner and\\nconventional middle-class overachiever.\\n\\nafter some 20 months, we\\'re all still getting used to obama and\\nstill, for that matter, trying to read his sometimes ambiguous\\ntakes on both economic and foreign affairs. what we have learned\\ndefinitively about him so far -- and what may most account for his\\nvictory, should he achieve it -- is that he had both the brains and\\nthe muscle to outsmart, outmaneuver and outlast some of the\\nsmartest people in the country, starting with the clintons. we know\\nthat he ran a brilliant campaign that remained sane and kept to its\\ninitial plan even when his republican

woman in the suv gave him an opening. \"i\\'m\\nundecided,\" said nicole ellington, 31, a paralegal with two young\\nchildren. \"you have two minutes. go.\"\\n\\noliver knew that her family leaned republican because she was on\\nhis get-out-the-vote list, and he rapidly delivered a pitch honed\\nover 22 years of volunteering for local campaigns. \"wow, you\\'re\\ngood,\" she said. and as she drove away, oliver smiled with\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\nbut did he really win her over? ellington had pointed to the\\n\"palin\" on his t-shirt and said, \"i\\'m worried about this one.\"\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know,\" oliver said after giving it some thought.\\n\"she may have been being polite.\"\\n\\noliver, 47, a real estate lawyer who walks and talks in bursts,\\nis the kind of party regular who is not usually one to doubt. he\\nhas been the orange county republican party chairman since 1999,\\nand with his encyclopedic knowledge of the neighborhoods and\\ndemographics of orlando, he built the grass-roots effort that\\npushed george w. bush to victory here and statewide in 2000 and\\n2004.\\n\\nbut this year, oliver said, the challenge is tougher. part of it\\nis the \"collapse of the economy of the western world,\" he said.\\npart is the competition, a campaign by sen. barack obama that has\\npoured more money and people into the state than sen. john mccain\\nhas. even the most seasoned republicans now acknowledge that they\\nface an uphill fight.\\n\\n\"this is as difficult an environment for republicans as there\\'s\\nbeen since watergate,\" said george lemieux, the former campaign\\nmanager for gov. charlie crist, a republican.\\n\\noliver agrees. and like many republicans trying in the final\\ndays to push their party to victory, he says he has found\\ninspiration in mccain, the perseverant prisoner of war who came\\nfrom behind to seize the republican nomination. the current call to\\narms is simple: \"if anyone can pull it off, it\\'s john mccain.\"\\n\\nas serious as iceland\\'s economic situation already was,\\nbritain -- their old friend, nato ally and trading partner -- made it\\nimmeasurably worse, in the view of iceland\\'s government, its\\ncitizens and even some outsiders.\\n\\nthe troubles between the countries began three weeks ago when\\nbritain took the extraordinary step of using its 2001\\nanti-terrorism laws to freeze the british assets of a failing\\nicelandic bank. that appeared to brand iceland a terrorist state.\\n\\n\"i must admit that i was absolutely appalled,\" the icelandic\\nforeign minister, ingibjorg solrun gisladottir, said in an\\ninterview, describing her horror at opening the british treasury\\ndepartment\\'s home page at the time and finding iceland on a list of\\nterrorist entities with al-qaida, sudan and north korea, among\\nothers.\\n\\n\"the immediate effect was to trigger an almost complete freeze\\non any banking transactions between iceland and abroad,\" said jon\\ndanielsson, an economist at the london school of economics. \"when\\nyou\\'re labeled a terrorist, nobody does business with you.\"\\n\\nthe icelandic prime minister, geir h. haarde, accused britain of\\n\"bullying a small neighbor,\" and said the action was \"very out\\nof proportion.\"\\n\\nand an online petition signed so far by more than 20 percent of\\niceland\\'s population said the british prime minister, gordon brown,\\nhad sacrificed iceland \"for his own short-term political gain,\"\\nthereby turning \"a grave situation into a national disaster.\"\\n\\niceland\\'s financial problems had been brewing for some time.\\nthis past spring, the country\\'s banks, bloated with foreign\\ndeposits and debts, began to falter. this fall, as the financial\\ncrisis deepened, the government took over two of the country\\'s\\nthree largest banks.\\n\\nthe british government, alarmed about the tens of thousands of\\naccounts held by its citizens, companies, local governments and\\ncharities, froze the british assets of one of the failed banks,\\nlandsbanki. it also seized the assets of kaupthing singer &amp;amp;\\nfriedlander, the british subsidiary of another icelandic bank,\\nkaupthing.\\n\\n\"the icelandic government, believe it or not, told me yesterday\\nthat they have no intention of honoring their obligations here,\"\\nalistair darling, the chancellor of the exchequer, declared the day\\nbritain seized the assets.\\n\\nthe icelandic government disputed that, saying it was merely\\nasking for time to make good on its obligations.\\n\\nwhatever the case, reaction was immediate and severe,\\nparticularly when brown said the following day -- inaccurately --\\nthat \"we are freezing the assets of icelandic companies in the\\nu.k. where we can.\"\\n\\niceland\\'s ambassador to britain, sverrir h. gunnlaugsson, said\\nin an interview that this statement was particularly damaging.\\n\\non a rainy friday evening in early august,\\nsix taliban fighters attacked a police post in a village in buner,\\na quiet farming valley just outside pakistan\\'s lawless tribal\\nregion.\\n\\nthe militants tied up eight policemen and lay them on the floor,\\nand according to local accounts, the youngest member of the gang, a\\n14-year-old, shot the captives on orders from his boss. the\\nfighters stole uniforms and weapons and fled into the mountains.\\n\\nalmost instantly, the people of buner, armed with rifles,\\ndaggers and pistols, formed a posse, and after five days they\\ncornered and killed their quarry. a video made on a cell phone\\nshowed the six militants lying in the dirt, blood oozing from their\\nwounds.\\n\\nthe stand at buner has entered the lore of pakistan\\'s war\\nagainst the militants as a dramatic example of ordinary citizens\\'\\ndetermination to draw a line against the militants.\\n\\nbut it says as much about the shortcomings of pakistan\\'s\\nincreasingly overwhelmed police forces and the pell-mell nature of\\nthe efforts to stop the militants, who week by week seem to seep\\ndeeper into pakistan from their tribal strongholds.\\n\\nsince the events in buner, the inspector general of the police\\nin the north-west frontier province, malik naveed khan, has\\nencouraged citizens in other towns and villages in his realm to\\nform posses of their own.\\n\\nthe hope is that determination itself will deter taliban\\nencroachment, building on the august victory with one phalanx after\\nanother of committed citizens.\\n\\nbut the strategy is also a sign of his desperation.\\n\\nhe has had to lower recruitment standards to fill out the ranks,\\nhe said. and he has supplemented his force with what he said were\\nsome 15,000 \"special police\" -- citizens whom he cannot pay, but\\nwhom he is willing to arm. \"any community which helps us, we give\\nthem weapons,\" khan said.\\n\\n\"there is no other way,\" khan said. \"pure military action\\nwould create a lot of devastation, to the extent that people would\\nturn against the government.\"\\n\\nsen. john mccain and sen. barack obama began their final push\\nfor the white house on saturday, returning to the themes that had\\nmarked their candidacies, with obama calling for a break from the\\nbush era and mccain challenging obama\\'s credentials to lead the\\ncountry during difficult times.\\n\\nthe campaign\\'s final days brought a reminder of obama\\'s\\nfinancial might through his ambitious effort to redraw the\\npolitical map. he is spending his time campaigning in states that\\nwent republicans four years ago -- colorado, missouri and nevada on\\nsaturday -- as he seeks a broad victory on tuesday.\\n\\nmccain pushed back with a burst of television advertising. his\\naides mapped out ambitious campaign travel that sent mccain and his\\nrunning mate, gov. sarah palin, to defend states that republicans\\nwon in 2004 and two -- new hampshire and pennsylvania -- that\\ndemocrats won last time.\\n\\nmccain and his advisers said they saw evidence he was gaining on\\nobama as mccain hammered home his attempt to paint obama as someone\\nwho would raise taxes on the middle class.\\n\\n\"we have never been as convinced as others by some of the\\ndiscouraging numbers,\" said nicolle wallace, a senior adviser to\\nmccain. \"we are not saying we are moving ahead of him. but we are\\ncertainly encouraged by the tightening of the polls.\"\\n\\nstill, mccain is on difficult ground. a spate of national and\\nbattleground-state polls showed obama with a sizable lead. much of\\nthe last-minute spending by mccain was in states that just two\\nmonths ago republicans believed to be safely in their column. they\\ninclude indiana, north carolina and virginia.\\n\\nmccain, at a modest outdoor rally in newport news, va., on\\nsaturday, left no doubt how important he viewed the battle in the\\nstate.\\n\\n\"let me state the obvious again: we need to win virginia on the\\n4th of november,\" mccain said, adding: \"my friends, i need your\\nhelp in the next three days. volunteer! knock on doors!\"\\n\\nmccain\\'s and palin\\'s weekend stops have been mainly in states\\nthat president bush won four years ago: colorado, florida, indiana,\\niowa, missouri, nevada, new mexico and ohio.\\n\\n\"if the race were closer, the states he\\'d be going to would be\\nblue states,\" said matthew dowd, who was bush\\'s chief strategist\\nin 2004. \"he\\'s campaigning as if he knows he\\'s significantly\\nbehind.\"\\n\\ntad devine, who was senior adviser to sen. john kerry, bush\\'s\\nopponent in 2004, said obama was in a substantially stronger\\nposition than kerry was at this point in his race.\\n\\n\"the difference is night and day,\" devine said. \"if you look\\nat where this is today compared with where we were four years ago,\\na whole cluster of states that weren\\'t even remotely in play --\\nvirginia, colorado, north dakota, indiana -- are truly\\ncompetitive.\"\\n\\nobama\\'s campaign manager, david plouffe, said he was confident\\nof victory in every state the democrats won in 2004, allowing obama\\nto put all his closing effort into keeping mccain on the defensive.\\n\"all the kerry states right now are in good shape for us,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe latest new york times electoral map puts five states in the\\ntoss-up category, based on polls, interviews with local analysts\\nand campaign officials: florida, indiana, missouri, north carolina\\nand ohio. bush won all those states in 2004. according to the times\\ncount, another five states that went with bush in 2004 -- colorado,\\niowa, nevada, new mexico and virginia -- were leaning toward obama\\ngoing into the weekend.\\n\\nmccain\\'s aides had, at the start of the month, listed as\\ntakeover targets four states that kerry won in 2004: minnesota, new\\nhampshire, pennsylvania and wisconsin. all four were leaning\\ndemocratic going into the last weekend, according to the times\\ntally. based on where he is campaigning and spending his money,\\nmccain has all but given up on minnesota and wisconsin.\\n\\nvirginia: in one county, gusts of change\\n\\nleesburg, va. -- at this time of year, the leaves in virginia are\\nstill turning in warmer parts of the state, a symbol perhaps of the\\nstate\\'s regional shifts from red to shades of purple.\\n\\nnowhere is virginia\\'s changing electorate more apparent than\\nhere in loudon county, where the influx of young families in\\nexurban sprawling developments has contributed to swinging a\\nsolidly republican state in presidential elections into a\\nbattleground. while cows still graze on farms nearby, the county\\'s\\nschools are exploding as a result of a population surge of almost\\n50 percent in the last decade.\\n\\nand that changing demographic is one reason sen. barack obama\\nholds a narrow lead in polls here as both campaigns battle for the\\nstate. obama, the democratic presidential nominee, and gov. sarah\\npalin, the republican vice-presidential nominee, held rallies here\\nin recent weeks; reminders of the race\\'s intensity are dueling yard\\nsigns, side by side from street to street, and in one storefront\\nafter another.\\n\\na democratic presidential candidate has not won virginia since\\nlyndon b. johnson in 1964. but the population trends and bluish\\npolitical winds, especially in the northern region, have\\ntransformed virginia into what mayor l. douglas wilder of richmond,\\nwho was the nation\\'s first black governor, calls the new dominion.\\n\\nto tammy enright, a general accounting manager from ashburn who\\nvoted for sen. john mccain, the republican candidate, last week,\\nloudon\\'s residents seem fairly divided. with a brother in the\\nmilitary who served two tours in iraq, enright, 37, said the\\nrepublican\\'s positions on the war made a \"big difference to her.\"\\nand although she worried about palin\\'s lack of experience, \"my\\nsupport of mccain outweighs that,\" she said.\\n\\nbut wilder, a democrat, sees a reversed pattern, with stalwart\\nrepublicans sizing up obama and realizing \"he\\'s talking pocketbook\\nissues. they are the things that really make a difference in these\\nrural areas.\"\\n\\nin loudon county, glen caroline, head of the local republican\\nparty, dismissed the idea that the democrats were the only ones\\nbrimming with enthusiasm. like others involved in the republicans\\'\\n72-hour get-out-the-vote efforts across the country, he plans an\\nall-out push through tuesday. \"republicans are very excited about\\nthis ticket,\" he said, \"and are very willing to vote for this\\nticket.\"\\n\\nand mccain and obama are making final stops here in the last\\ndays of the campaign.\\n\\n-- kate phillips\\n\\npennsylvania: battle royal for a big state\\n\\nphiladelphia -- the mccain campaign may be down in some polls by\\ndouble-digit margins in pennsylvania, which has not voted\\nrepublican in a presidential race since 1988. yet the campaign\\nknows it must take the state if it wants to win the white house,\\nand it is taking a page from sen. hillary rodham clinton\\'s playbook\\nto try to do so.\\n\\nto that end, sen. john mccain has poured $20 million in\\nadvertisement purchases here, more than any other state by a long\\nshot. (still, he is swamped by obama, who has spent $34 million\\nhere.) the candidate has come to the state more than 16 times since\\nearly june, and his running mate, gov. sarah palin, continues to\\nstump here in the campaign\\'s waning days. even \"joe the plumber\"\\ncampaigned for mccain at a popular south philadelphia cheese steak\\nhaunt last week.\\n\\nbut to go to sen. barack obama\\'s headquarters in center city is\\nto see what mccain is up against. the office is jammed with more\\nthan 50 volunteers on computers and on the phones, preparing for an\\norchestrated get-out-the vote drive. even a television crew from\\nindonesia was there to film it, adding to a palpable sense of\\nexcitement. by contrast, at a nearby mccain-palin office, there was\\nnot a single volunteer, a reflection how mccain is concentrating on\\ndrawing votes in more rural areas of pennsylvania.\\n\\nstill, the state has long posed a challenge to obama, and the\\ntime and money spent by the mccain campaign has put obama on the\\ndefensive. clinton won by a comfortable margin here in the\\ndemocratic primary, and took more than 70 percent of the votes in\\nsome of the conservative western counties. all this has given the\\nmccain campaign hope that it might have a chance in this reliably\\ndemocratic state, as other republican strongholds slip away.\\n\\nthe key to a mccain victory is threefold: to highlight his\\nmaverick image among moderate swing voters in the philadelphia\\nsuburbs; to hold onto republican strongholds in the south-central\\npart of the state, which are mostly white and conservative\\nprotestant, and to win big in the western coal region, where\\nclinton gained support from pro-gun, working-class voters.\\n\\nbut mccain is up against determined obama volunteers like linda\\ndee from buffalo. \"mobilization is the key to our effort,\" dee\\nsaid. \"everything is from the ground up.\"\\n\\n-- leslie wayne\\n\\nohio: city and rural, tooth and nail\\n\\nchillicothe, ohio -- two grandfathers, each with two\\ngrandchildren grabbing their hands, walk down the sidewalk in this\\ncity in the rolling appalachian hills.\\n\\nthey incarnate the presidential election in this city and this\\nstate: dan young, 56, a pulp mill manager, is voting for sen. john\\nmccain \"because that man\\'s got the wisdom.\"\\n\\nrichard hawkins, a 60-year-old nurse, favors sen. barack obama\\n\"because the last eight years have just bully whipped us\\neconomically, and mccain doesn\\'t know what it\\'s like to be in debt\\nand hurting.\"\\n\\npolls show obama with a narrow lead, but even partisans put\\nlittle stock in those. hard experience has shown that ohio tends to\\noffer intense matches and bleary eyes while awaiting election-night\\nreturns.\\n\\nheavily republican counties line the western and central parts\\nof the state, and democrats dominate in columbus, dayton and\\ncleveland. but the electoral war is fought out in more divided\\nprecincts like chillicothe, a predominantly white city of 21,000\\nthat mirrored the statewide results in the last two elections by\\ngoing narrowly for president bush.\\n\\nenthusiasm runs high. here and across the state, officials\\nexpect one-third of the voters to vote early.\\n\\n\"the enthusiasm is amazing, off the charts,\" said diane\\ncarnes, the ross county republican chairwoman and a real estate\\nagent in chillicothe. \"i\\'ve got democrats walking in and asking to\\nvolunteer for mccain.\"\\n\\ngov. ted strickland, who hails from hilly southeastern ohio, has\\nworked his home precincts hard for obama. the governor helped sen.\\nhillary rodham clinton win there in the democratic primary.\\n\\n\"any democrat who neglects the rural voters won\\'t win; it\\'s\\nthat simple,\" said mayor michael b. coleman of columbus. \"and\\nobama has put a lot of effort -- a lot -- into winning there.\"\\n\\ngov. sarah palin of alaska has, polls show, turned off centrist\\nindependents. but she has excited her party\\'s powerful evangelical\\nbase.\\n\\n\"if mccain wins here, he\\'ll owe her a debt,\" said mark caleb\\nsmith, director of the center for political studies at cedarville\\nuniversity. \"she is much more populist and anti-elite than\\nrepublicans are used to, and she articulates a lot of their\\ncultural angst.\"\\n\\nevangelical leaders were slow to warm to mccain, but they have\\nrallied. on a radio station on friday, evangelical pastors prayed\\nfor god to help voters \"avoid wickedness\" and help deliver\\n\"electoral miracles on election day.\"\\n\\n-- michael powell\\n\\nnorth carolina: first real race in a generation\\n\\nrocky mount, n.c. -- at a rally here with michelle obama the\\nother day, little slips of paper were tucked into the windshields\\nof cars in the parking lot. they announced a free breakfast, paid\\nfor by local democrats, on behalf of sen. barack obama on saturday,\\nthe last day of early voting.\\n\\nthe fliers were a small reminder of something big -- the obama\\norganization in this state.\\n\\nnorth carolina has not seen a real presidential race for a\\ngeneration. but in one of the biggest surprises of this long\\ncampaign season, obama has pulled even in the polls with sen. john\\nmccain.\\n\\nobama has more than twice as many offices, more than twice as\\nmany paid staff members and thousands more unpaid volunteers. he\\nhas outspent mccain more than 8-to-1 on television advertising,\\nalthough mccain has increased his spending in recent weeks.\\n\\nboth campaigns have stepped up their face time here, with gov.\\nsarah palin, mccain\\'s running mate, appearing saturday and obama\\nexpected to be back monday.\\n\\na record number of people have voted early; twice as many were\\ndemocrats as republicans.\\n\\n\"my people didn\\'t always have the right to vote,\" said joseph\\nscott, 40, who works in banking, as he stood in line in greensboro\\nfor more than an hour to vote for obama.\\n\\nblacks like scott make up about 21 percent of registered voters,\\nand the degree to which they turn out for obama will be a critical\\npiece of the puzzle.\\n\\nbut mccain\\'s selection of palin has inspired cultural\\nconservatives. her rallies are energetic; she had the country stars\\ngretchen wilson in asheville belting out \"i\\'m a redneck woman\"\\nand hank williams jr. in elon singing his own \"mccain-palin\\ntradition.\"\\n\\nthrough rallies, commercials and automated calls, the mccain\\ncampaign casts obama as a radical.\\n\\n\"he\\'s a socialist,\" bob hartsock, 78, who works in real estate\\nin concord, said after a mccain rally there.\\n\\nworking to obama\\'s advantage is an influx of new voters --\\npotentially more moderate -- and the mounting economic crisis.\\n\\nruby hill-benjamin, 53, a registered nurse, was one of hundreds\\nof people in an overflow room here shrieking for michelle obama.\\nshe said she had voted for president bush because she liked his\\nfaith initiative. but mccain is \"running on the past,\" she said,\\nand she is inspired by the obamas: \"they are speaking for all\\namericans.\"\\n\\n-- katharine q.seelye\\n\\nnew hampshire: mccain seeks \\'life support\\'\\n\\nnashua, n.h. -- new hampshire propelled sen. john mccain toward\\nhis party\\'s nomination this year, and his campaign hoped that his\\nnonconformist brand of republicanism would be an easy sell for the\\ngeneral election. in recent weeks, however, sen. barack obama, the\\ndemocratic presidential nominee, has taken a commanding lead in\\npolls here.\\n\\nstill, new hampshire voters are a capricious bunch, as sen.\\nhillary rodham clinton\\'s surprise victory over obama in the\\ndemocratic primary proved. obama had a double-digit lead in some\\npolls going into the primary, in january, and his startling defeat\\nis reason for some to believe that mccain still has a shot.\\n\\nto that end, mccain is returning to the state this weekend.\\n\"new hampshire has given him life support twice,\" said jennifer\\ndonahue, political director of the new hampshire institute of\\npolitics at st. anselm college.\\n\\ndespite new hampshire\\'s longtime affection for mccain, the state\\nhas been trending democratic for years.\\n\\nresearch by the university of new hampshire survey center\\nsuggests that a third of the state\\'s electorate is new since 2000,\\nwhen george w. bush defeated al gore here. the research found that\\nmore than half of these new voters are democrats.\\n\\nso why should mccain bother returning to the state?\\n\\n\"his theme of obama meaning higher taxes really resonates\\nhere,\" donahue said. \"no matter what the polls say the week\\nbefore the election, new hampshire voters make their final decision\\nin the last three days. mccain knows it, and that\\'s why he\\'s coming\\nback.\"\\n\\ndemocrats, too, think the race is closer than it seems. one of\\nobama\\'s highest-profile surrogates, former president bill clinton,\\nis to campaign here sunday. and in a separate visit last week,\\nhillary clinton warned democrats not to get complacent.\\n\\nray buckley, head of the state\\'s democratic party, said it was\\nundertaking the largest get-out-the-vote effort in state history,\\nwith more than 3,000 volunteers canvassing neighborhoods and\\nworking phones.\\n\\nbuckley said the effort would focus on blue-collar cities won by\\nclinton in january, including nashua, manchester and rochester.\\n\\nthe republicans were also homing in on areas that embraced\\nclinton, with \"a better-organized, better-oiled machine than even\\nbush \\'04 had,\" said fergus cullen, chairman of the state\\'s\\nrepublican party. an important target, he said, is the\\n\"blue-collar, working-class male who\\'s registered as a democrat\\nbut not in touch with that party culturally.\"\\n\\n-- abby goodnough\\n\\nmontana: seeing a lot of obama\\n\\nhelena, mont. -- this state, with its small cities and wide-open\\nspaces, is not used to seeing presidential candidates. but this\\nyear, many montanans have been pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nsen. barack obama has run an aggressive campaign here, spending\\nabout $160,000 a week on advertising and visiting the state five\\ntimes during the campaign, including spending the fourth of july in\\nbutte. that kind of attention is unheard of.\\n\\n\"he has a real shot,\" pat williams, a former longtime\\ndemocratic congressman from montana, said of obama. \"part of it is\\nhis incessant traveling in montana and the lack of a single\\nfootprint by mccain.\"\\n\\nbut there is one unpredictable factor that may help decide the\\nrace: ron paul, the libertarian texas congressman running on the\\nconstitutional party line here. paul\\'s supporters here asked if\\nthey could put his name on the ballot. he agreed, then changed his\\nmind; but his request to be taken off the ballot came too late.\\n\\nnow polls show him drawing 4 percent, and he is particularly\\npopular among conservative voters in this independent-minded state,\\njust the kind of voters sen. john mccain, the republican\\npresidential nominee, needs.\\n\\nwith polls suggesting a close race, the republicans are mounting\\na last-minute push. the republican national committee was planning\\nto spend $300,000 to $400,000 in these final days of the race, most\\nof it on television advertising.\\n\\nsome republicans think montana will be an uphill battle for\\nobama, the democratic nominee, particularly because of the issue of\\ngun control.\\n\\n\"i find it hard to believe, given his radical view on guns,\\nthat he\\'s doing as well as he is,\" said joe balyeat, a republican\\nstate senator and gun-rights supporter. \"i think mccain will win.\\nhunting and shooting sports are a way of life here.\" while obama\\nhas said he would not take guns away from people, balyeat thinks\\notherwise.\\n\\nthe last time a democrat won a presidential election in montana\\nwas bill clinton in 1992, and that victory was chalked up to ross\\nperot\\'s presence in the race, and his siphoning of a substantial\\nnumber of votes from the elder president george bush. but the\\ncurrent president bush carried the state by 20 percent in 2000 and\\n2004.\\n\\nobama has worked hard to win the state, and his work has gone\\nbeyond just visiting. he has opened 19 campaign offices here, while\\nmccain has none.\\n\\nthose offices are a base for obama\\'s drive to turn out\\nsympathetic voters.\\n\\n-- jim robbins\\n\\nmissouri: picking winners is a specialty\\n\\nwarrenton, mo. -- one of the first places sen. barack obama\\nvisited after clinching the democratic nomination was cape\\ngirardeau, mo., the birthplace of rush limbaugh. on saturday, obama\\nended his campaigning in this battleground state with a rally in\\nspringfield, the hometown of former attorney general john ashcroft.\\n\\nmissouri has voted for the winner in every presidential election\\nsave one over the last century, and obama seems to be fighting for\\nevery ballot in every county, including those areas normally\\nhostile to a liberal democrat.\\n\\nsen. john mccain has also campaigned heavily here, as has his\\nrunning mate, gov. sarah palin, and polls show the race in missouri\\ntighter than anywhere in the nation.\\n\\nthe tradition here is for democrats to run up majorities in st.\\nlouis and kansas city and republicans to dominate in the dozens of\\nrural counties in between, leaving both parties to fight over the\\nsuburbs around the two big cities. that is a pattern that, thanks\\nto pocketbook issues, would seem to benefit obama.\\n\\n\"obama is the leader who can change the economy to what we\\nneed,\" said mike delia, 27, a machine operator in warren county,\\noutside st. louis, where obama drew 100,000 people to an oct. 18\\nrally. \"mccain talks \\'country first,\\' but he has put the interests\\nof iraq ahead of the united states.\"\\n\\nbut obama faces a challenge in that three of every eight\\nmissourians describe themselves as evangelical christians, compared\\nwith about a quarter of people nationwide. mccain won the\\nrepublican primary here narrowly, receiving less than a third of\\nthe vote and narrowly defeating former gov. mike huckabee of\\nneighboring arkansas.\\n\\nso a basic question, especially in the southern part of the\\nstate, is whether the religious right will put aside its\\nreservations about mccain and vote for him or stay home. huckabee\\nand mitt romney have been campaigning vigorously for their former\\nrival. but it could prove decisive if even a few evangelicals\\ndefect to obama, who has also been wooing them.\\n\\nthat is why mccain is counting on social conservatives like bea\\nfarrell, 79, a retiree originally from arkansas.\\n\\n\"we don\\'t want obama because he\\'s not qualified and is going\\nabout everything the wrong way,\" she said at a mall in neighboring\\nst. charles county. \"he doesn\\'t stand for american values. mccain\\nis going to keep us safe.\"\\n\\n-- larryrohter\\n\\ngeorgia: black turnout may hold key\\n\\natlanta -- on friday, sen. barack obama\\'s campaign began\\nbroadcasting two commercials here, in a sign of its renewed hopes\\nthat georgia could be truly competitive in this election.\\n\\nit was a swift turnaround. the campaign initially had georgia on\\nits wish list, but just two months ago, it went off the air here\\nand moved out some of its paid staff members. sen. john mccain\\'s\\ncampaign, meanwhile, treated georgia as an automatic win.\\n\\nbut then came the reports from early polling stations: people\\nwere waiting more than four hours in some places to cast their\\nballots, and 35 percent of them were black. by the time early\\nvoting closed on friday, more than 1.7 million of georgia\\'s 5.6\\nmillion registered voters had cast their ballots, and many of them\\nwere in left-leaning urban counties in and around atlanta, where\\nsupport for obama is at a fever pitch.\\n\\n\"i feel like this is the year out of every other year in\\nhistory that georgia could go for a democrat,\" said triniece\\nbritt, a client relations manager at a mortgage company and an\\nobama supporter, who was waiting in a four-hour line to vote on\\nfriday \"people are hungry for something different. people want\\nchange so bad that they\\'ll wait as long it takes.\"\\n\\nwhat remains to be seen is the demographics of the turnout on\\nelection day. analysts are not certain if it will be overwhelmingly\\nwhite, or if it will more closely mirror the demographics of the\\nelectorate, which is 29 percent black, keeping black turnout high.\\n\\n\"if it\\'s anything close to 30 percent in the end, that would\\ngive obama a big chance,\" said alan abramowitz, a political\\nscience professor at emory university.\\n\\nthe long lines at early polling stations have also raised\\nconcerns that the voting system is not equipped to handle an\\nexpected surge on election day.\\n\\nmatt towery, a republican political consultant and pollster,\\nsaid he would not be surprised if the margin of victory in georgia\\ncame down to 10,000 or 20,000 votes -- well within battleground\\nrange. just six years ago, he noted, the state was controlled by\\ndemocrats, but lately the party\\'s base has not turned out.\\n\\n\"because barack obama is running, he has brought that\\ndemocratic voting base back out,\" towery said. \"if georgia votes\\nat full strength, then it\\'s a highly competitive state.\"\\n\\nhe added, \"you cannot be the fastest-growing state in the\\nnation for african-american population and be drifting to become a\\nmassively republican red state.\"\\n\\n-- shaila dewan and robbie brown\\n\\nflorida: wrong house, but right state?\\n\\norlando, fla. -- on thursday, two republican canvassers appeared\\nat beth moriarty\\'s door in orlando looking for her husband\\'s vote.\\nher response was blunt.\\n\\n\"y\\'all are totally at the wrong house,\" moriarty said. \"my\\nhusband, he\\'s 62, he has never voted for a democrat in his entire\\nlife. until tuesday.\"\\n\\nperhaps no state in recent presidential politics is more\\nresonant than florida, which democrats would love to recapture\\nafter two consecutive defeats that included the bitter recount of\\n2000. and florida is a state that sen. john mccain must win to\\ncapture the presidency. but after coasting through the summer,\\nmccain, the republican nominee, now finds himself falling behind in\\nmany recent polls.\\n\\nsen. barack obama, the democratic presidential nominee, has a\\nlitany of structural advantages to help him retake florida for the\\ndemocrats. with only days to go, the obama campaign has more of\\njust about everything: offices (100 to mccain\\'s 80); advertising\\nmoney (outspending the mccain campaign 4-to1 in some weeks); and\\nvoter registrations (a 660,000 democratic edge over republicans, up\\nfrom 280,000 in 2006).\\n\\nnone of this is destiny, of course, in such an unpredictable\\nstate. every poll since sept. 12 (50 of them) shows a gap of single\\ndigits between the candidates, which could be closed by any number\\nof last-second surprises.\\n\\nmccain, who spent time stationed here in the navy, has recently\\nrevived what had been a flagging effort. on oct. 23, he\\ncrisscrossed florida from daytona beach to sarasota, hammering\\nenergetically on an economic theme, telling audiences that\\n\"obama\\'s tax increases would put even more people out of work.\"\\n\\nwith unemployment in florida at its highest rate in 14 years,\\nthe message will no doubt be heard. the state and national\\nrepublican party has also amplified the argument with television\\nadvertisements and one particularly blunt mailer that said,\\n\"barack obama\\'s solution is to take more of your money!\"\\n\\nbut, according to analysts and voters, the shift toward economic\\nissues amounts to mccain playing on the democrats\\' turf, putting\\nflorida once again in the crosshairs of both campaigns.\\n\\n\"we need to bring our best game these last couple days before\\nthe election,\" said george lemieux, the former campaign manager\\nfor gov. charlie crist, a republican. he expressed hope that the\\nrepublican field operation would prevail.\\n\\n\"there are a lot of republicans who have been through a lot of\\nbattles before,\" he said. \"they know the game.\"\\n\\n-- damien cave\\n\\ncolorado: early voting changes tactics\\n\\ndenver -- the reality in colorado is that a big piece of the\\nelection is already over.\\n\\nthe state\\'s heavy emphasis on mail-in and early voting means\\nthat close to 1.5 million votes, or about 46 percent of the\\nregistered total, are already in the can, cast and waiting to be\\ncounted.\\n\\nthat means two things. first, that a surge, or a misstep, at the\\nlast minute can only help or hurt so much, since voter decisions\\nwere in many cases made on conclusions reached in mid-to-late\\noctober. second, it mandates, in a still-tight race, a pinpoint,\\nsurgical search for the votes still remaining.\\n\\nmary ann larsen and diane tapia-gonzales, who knocked on doors\\nin the denver suburb of arvada on thursday night as volunteers for\\nsen. barack obama, the democratic candidate, epitomized the new\\nnarrow-cast focus. on their computer-generated lists, every name\\ncame with a one-to-five scale based on prior contact -- one being\\ncommitted to obama, five being four-square for the republican\\ncandidate, john mccain. the women knew who had already voted --\\nupdates come in daily from local county clerks -- and who had a\\nmail-in ballot in hand not yet submitted.\\n\\nmccain\\'s campaign is similarly obsessed with the details.\\n\\n\"everyone knows which votes are turned in and where the votes\\nare that are left,\" said tom kise, the campaign\\'s communications\\ndirector for its south central region.\\n\\nbut so far, that knowledge has probably not been entirely\\ncomforting to mccain supporters. of the mail-in ballots received as\\nof friday, more registered democrats had cast their ballots than\\nrepublicans or unaffiliated voters, either by mail or by early\\nvoting in regular polling places. registered republicans outnumber\\ndemocrats in colorado by about 10,000, out of 3.2 million total,\\nwith unaffiliated voters the largest group by far.\\n\\nmccain\\'s television advertising presence in the state also\\ndropped beginning two weeks ago -- a decision that kise said was\\npurely tactical. at the cbs affiliate in denver, kcnc, for example,\\nobama has been outspending mccain by almost 3-to-1 since a decision\\nin mid-october to spread mccain advertisements out over the\\nremaining time until the election.\\n\\nwith some polls showing obama up by large margins, he is still\\nnot taking any chances. he plans a rally on saturday in pueblo, a\\nheavily hispanic, mostly blue-collar democratic stronghold. pueblo\\ncounty is where the votes are, with lower numbers of early or\\nmail-in voters than many other counties.\\n\\n-- kirk

percent.\\n\\nbehind the news: market analysts were hard-pressed to identify a\\nsingle catalyst for the surge. they tended to point instead to a\\ngeneral feeling that the sharp sell-offs of recent weeks, partly\\nowing to sales forced by the financial crisis, had been overdone,\\nand that stocks had been beaten down to attractive prices. it was a\\nday when bad news just wouldn\\'t stick:

0.3 percent\\nto reduce borrowing costs and ease a growing credit crunch in\\njapan. with interest rates already so low, economists said the\\naction was unlikely to stimulate borrowing. but they said

long\\nsiege. a new budget expected to be approved in the coming week\\nwould double the country\\'s military budget to $500 million -- or 25\\npercent of all government spending.\\n\\nthe encampment here has the village feel of cambodian\\ndeployments throughout conflicts in recent decades.\\n\\nat the bottom of the great stone causeway, giant loops of silver\\nrazor wire close off the main entrance, which is guarded by armed\\nmen wearing sandals; the 900-year-old temple, with its sagging\\nwalls and tumbling columns, is empty of tourists.\\n\\ntiny marks of shrapnel fleck the great stone staircase that\\nrises from the thai side to the temple, along with two stone\\ndragons that flank the steps. but nothing seems to have been gained\\nor lost in the fighting.\\n\\nthe dispute flared in july, when unesco, the cultural agency of\\nthe united nations, declared the temple a world heritage site,\\nbased on a cambodian government proposal. domestic politics in\\nthailand fueled a nationalist response, and troops, artillery and\\ntanks were moved into position.\\n\\nthe confrontation echoes with the history of the rise and\\nretreat of empires over the centuries, and old fears and hatreds\\nstill burn between cambodia and its more powerful neighbors,\\nvietnam and thailand.\\n\\nin the final moments of the most gripping campaign in modern\\nhistory, john mccain is still trying to costume barack obama as a\\ndangerous enigma.\\n\\nbut, in an odd and remarkable reversal, it is mccain who is the\\nenigma, even though he entered the race with one of the best brands\\nin american politics.\\n\\nand it is obama, who sashayed onto the trail two years ago as an\\naloof and exotic mystery man with a slim record and a strange name,\\nnow coming across as the steadier brand.\\n\\nthe mccain campaign specializes in erratica, while the obama\\ncampaign continues to avoid any dramatica.\\n\\nmccain pals around with joe the plumber and leaves tito the\\nbuilder to sarah palin, exactly the kind of inane campaign\\nsilliness that the mccain formerly known as maverick would have\\nmocked mercilessly.\\n\\nhe\\'s getting a little traction on taxes, as he latches on to\\nevery possible scary image about obama -- except the suggestion that\\nthe democrat\\'s gray hart schaffner marx suits are red.\\n\\nbefore he was bubbled by bushies, mccain was one of the most\\nknown and knowable quantities in american politics. for most of his\\nlong public career, he prided himself on his openness with the\\npress -- he even allowed some reporters to watch the results of\\njanuary\\'s new hampshire primary in his hotel suite in nashua. he\\nrelished spending all day being challenged by voters and reporters.\\n\\nlast summer, tapped out and unable to afford a paid staff of\\npolitical professionals, he talked freely, telling reporters he\\nwould have a white house that would be the polar opposite of the\\nsecretive and dismissive bush-cheney operation. he imagined weekly\\npress conferences and talked of subjecting himself to a version of\\nbritish question time in congress. while acknowledging he was a\\ntech tyro, he promised to try \"a google,\" as he called searching\\nthe web, to put government spending online so citizens could\\nbird-dog it.\\n\\nhe even went so far as to spin a dream of a west wing in which\\nhe would cut back on his secret service so he wouldn\\'t feel so\\nconstrained.\\n\\nin the end, \"the bullet,\" or \"sarge,\" as mccain calls his\\nreplacement campaign manager, steve schmidt, was the one who did\\nthe shackling, turning the vibrant and respected mccain into a\\nshell of his former self.\\n\\nschmidt abruptly cut off the oxygen supply to mccain\\'s brain. no\\nmore of the oldest established, permanent floating craps game of\\npress confabs. no more audiences that weren\\'t vetted for\\nfriendliness. no more of mccain\\'s trademark insouciant mocking the\\nprocess even as he participated in it.\\n\\nwhether it was the five years he spent in a hole in hanoi or\\njust his gregarious makeup, mccain seemed to feed off of the\\ncompany of people who interested him, be it reporters, voters or\\nthe pols in his posse, like joe lieberman and lindsey graham.\\n\\nunlike obama, he who walks alone, mccain always rejected the\\nsolitary in favor of the social. but ever since sgt. schmidt put\\ncapt. mccain into a sterile brig on the trail, the candidate has\\nbecome a question mark.\\n\\nwhy would he repeat that oblivious line about the fundamentals\\nof the economy being strong, saying it once in august and again in\\nseptember?\\n\\nwhy would he threaten to not show up for a debate (after\\ndenouncing obama for not rising to the challenge of joint town\\nhalls) so that he could go to washington and play the shining\\nknight if he had no plan and no prospect for success?\\n\\nwhy did he allow his campaign to become a host body for a bush\\nvirus looking for someplace to infect? after working so hard to\\nerase the image of what senate aides called \"the bush hug,\"\\nmccain inexplicably hugged bushies, surrounding himself with\\nmercenaries trained in the same rovian tactics that tore up his\\nfamily -- and tore apart his campaign -- in 2000.\\n\\nwhy did a politician who once knew how to play the game so well,\\nwho was once so beloved by people of very different political\\nstripes, allow his campaign to get whiny, angry, vengeful and\\nbitter?\\n\\nwhy palin?\\n\\n(her latest instant classics came friday, when she entered a\\nrally in york, pa., to the tune of \"thriller\" and when a\\nconservative radio station broadcast an interview in which she\\naccused reporters of threatening her first amendment rights by\\nattacking her for negative campaigning that she feels justifiably\\ncalls out obama \"on his associations.\")\\n\\nwhy did he allow his staff to put palin on a couture catwalk in\\na tin-cup economy and then, when the price tags were exposed, trash\\nher as a \"diva\" and \"whack job,\" thus becoming the rare\\nrepublican campaign devoured by democratic-style vicious\\ninfighting?\\n\\nthe ultimate riddle is this: why doesn\\'t mccain question why he\\nhas become a question mark?\\n\\nafter weeks of testimony about a suitcase stuffed with\\nillegal campaign contributions bound for buenos aires, a federal\\njury here remains undecided about the role of a venezuelan\\nbusinessman.\\n\\nthe businessman, franklin duran, is charged with conspiracy and\\nwith operating in the united states as an unauthorized agent of a\\nforeign government.\\n\\nprosecutors say duran, who owns a house in the miami area, came\\nto the united states at the behest of the venezuelan government to\\ncoerce a friend to conceal the source and destination of an\\n$800,000 cash contribution to the 2007 campaign of an argentine\\npresidential candidate, cristina fernandez de kirchner, who went on\\nto win the election.\\n\\njurors have deliberated for seven days but remain deadlocked.\\nearlier this week they sent a note to judge joan a. lenard saying\\nthey were at an impasse.\\n\\nlenard instructed them to continue deliberating.\\n\\nboth kirchner and her venezuelan counterpart, president hugo\\nchavez, have denied any role in the matter, which has made\\nheadlines in latin america.\\n\\nthe jury\\'s impasse has prompted some venezuelans to speculate in\\nnews blogs and internet chat rooms that the chavez administration\\nis somehow manipulating the jury to prevent a guilty verdict.\\n\\n\"if he is found guilty, those that are anti-chavez will be\\nhappy,\" said laura weffer, an investigative reporter for the\\nleading venezuelan newspaper el nacional, who has covered the duran\\ntrial from its inception in september. \"but if there is a\\nmistrial, they will say he bought the jurors.\"\\n\\ndeliberations could continue until late next week, a defense\\nlawyer said, as the jurors will convene for an abbreviated session\\non monday and be pardoned from court altogether tuesday because two\\njurors have a conflict that day.\\n\\nhere\\'s what strikes me this election eve: i can\\'t remember a\\npresidential campaign that was so disconnected from the actual\\nchallenges of governing that will confront the winner the morning\\nafter. when this election campaign began two years ago, the big\\nissue was how and for how long we continue nation-building in iraq.\\nas the campaign comes to a close, the big issue is how and at what\\nsacrifice we do nation-building in america.\\n\\nunfortunately, you\\'d barely know that from the presidential\\ndebates. watching them in the context of the meltdown of the\\nfinancial system was like watching a game show where the two\\ncontestants were kept offstage in a soundproof booth and brought\\nout to address the audience without knowing the context.\\n\\nsince the last debate, john mccain and barack obama have\\nunveiled broad ideas about how to restore the nation\\'s financial\\nhealth. but they continue to suggest that this will be largely\\npain-free. mccain says giving everyone a tax cut will save the day;\\nobama tells us only the rich will have to pay to help us out of\\nthis hole. neither is true.\\n\\nwe are all going to have to pay, because this meltdown comes\\nin the context of what has been \"perhaps the greatest wealth\\ntransfer since the bolshevik revolution in russia in 1917,\" says\\nmichael mandelbaum, author of \"democracy\\'s good name.\" \"it is\\nnot a wealth transfer from rich to poor that the bush\\nadministration will be remembered for. it is a wealth transfer from\\nthe future to the present.\"\\n\\nnever has one generation spent so much of its children\\'s wealth\\nin such a short period of time with so little to show for it as in\\nthe bush years. under george w. bush, america has foisted onto\\nfuture generations a huge financial burden to finance our current\\ntax cuts, wars and now bailouts. just paying off those debts will\\nrequire significant sacrifices. but when you add the destruction of\\nwealth that has taken place in the last two months in the markets,\\nand the need for more bailouts, you understand why this is not\\ngoing to be a painless recovery.\\n\\nthe bush team leaves us with another debt -- one to mother\\nnature. we have added tons more co2 into the atmosphere these last\\neight years, without any mitigation effort. as a result, slowing\\ndown climate change in the next eight years is going to require\\neven bigger changes and investments in how we use energy.\\n\\ngiven that new york times columnists are not allowed to\\n\"formally\" endorse candidates and given that the context of this\\nelection has changed so much from the policy positions the\\ncandidates started with, all i can suggest is that you vote for the\\ncandidate with these character traits:\\n\\nfirst, we need a president who can speak english and deconstruct\\nand navigate complex issues so americans can make informed choices.\\nwe have paid an enormous price for having a president who could not\\nexplain and reassure us during this financial meltdown. we wasted a\\nhuge amount of time pretending that we could punish wall street\\nwithout punishing main street -- when, in fact, they are intricately\\nintertwined.\\n\\na major money market fund -- reserve primary -- failed in\\nseptember because the extra interest it offered customers derived,\\nin part, from the $785 million in high-yielding lehman brothers\\ncommercial paper and notes it was holding. depositors who told\\ntheir congressmen to just let that greedy lehman brothers fail were\\nshocked to discover this meant that their own money market would be\\nfrozen. no, we don\\'t need a president defending greed on wall\\nstreet, but we do need one who can explain that we are all in the\\nsame boat, that a leak at one end can sink everyone and that while\\nwe must regulate, we don\\'t want to kill risk-taking and the rewards\\nthat go with that -- which are essential to growing our economy.\\n\\nsecond, we need a president who can energize, inspire and hold\\nthe country together during what will be a very stressful recovery.\\nwe have to climb out of this financial crisis at a time when the\\nbaby boomers are about to retire and going to need their social\\nsecurity and eventually medicare. we are all going to be paying the\\ngovernment more and getting less until we grow out of this hole.\\n\\nthird, we need a president who can rally the world to our side.\\nwe cannot get out of this crisis unless china starts consuming more\\nand unless europe keeps lowering interest rates. everyone is\\ninterconnected, and everyone is still looking to america to lead.\\n\\nso, bottom line: please do not vote for the candidate you most\\nwant to have a beer with (unless it\\'s to get stone-cold drunk so\\nyou don\\'t have to think about this mess we\\'re in). vote for the\\nperson you\\'d most like at your side when you ask your bank manager\\nfor an extension on your mortgage.\\n\\nvote for the candidate you think has the smarts, temperament and\\ninspirational capacity to unify the country and steer our ship\\nthrough what could be the rockiest shoals our generation has ever\\nknown. your kids will thank you.\\n\\nthe supreme court specializes in law, not\\nlexicography. but it will soon have to consider the meaning of that\\nmost versatile of four-letter words.\\n\\nthe oxford english dictionary\\'s three core entries on the word --\\nnoun, verb and interjection -- are about six times as long as this\\narticle. that doesn\\'t count about 30 derivations and compounds, all\\ncolorful and many recent. the nimble word, the dictionary tells us,\\ncan help express that a person is incompetent; that another is not\\nbe meddled with; that a situation has been botched; that one does\\nnot have the slightest clue; and, in a recent addition, that\\nsomeone has enough money to be able to quit an unpleasant job.\\n\\nyou know the word i mean.\\n\\na central question in the case of federal communications\\ncommission v. fox television stations, to be argued tuesday, is\\nwhether every permutation of the word evokes sex and thus runs\\nafoul of indecency regulations, which prohibit the broadcasting of\\nmaterial that \"depicts or describes sexual or excretory activities\\nor organs.\"\\n\\n\"given its core meaning,\" the commission told the court, \"any\\nuse of the word has a sexual connotation even if the word is not\\nused literally.\"\\n\\nthus, when the pop star bono emphasized his glee at receiving a\\ngolden globe award in 2003 by saying his victory was \"really,\\nreally\" -- insert a form of the word here -- \"brilliant,\" the\\ncommission contended there was a sexual element. so too when cher,\\non another awards show, used the word to propose something that\\nought to be done to her critics.\\n\\nand there was sex in the air, the commission said, when nicole\\nrichie, at a third awards show, veered from these scripted\\ncomments: \"have you ever tried to get cow manure out of a prada\\npurse? it\\'s not so freaking simple.\" richie did not say\\n\"manure,\" and she did not say \"freaking.\"\\n\\nbono, cher and richie all made sexual references, and all were\\nindecent, the commission says. \"it hardly seems debatable,\" the\\ncommission wrote in 2006, \"that the word\\'s power to \\'intensify\\'\\nand offend derives from its implicit sexual meaning\" as \"one of\\nthe most vulgar, graphic and explicit words for sexual activity in\\nthe english language.\"\\n\\nthe federal appeals court in new york disagreed. \"as the\\ngeneral public well knows,\" judge rosemary s. pooler wrote for the\\nmajority last year, four-letter words \"are often used in everyday\\nconversation without any \\'sexual or excretory\\' meaning.\"\\n\\nbono\\'s exclamation, pooler added, is \"a prime example of a\\nnonliteral use\" that has \"no sexual connotation.\" in support of\\nthat proposition, she cited remarks from president bush (about the\\nneed to get hezbollah to stop doing, uh, stuff) and vice president\\ndick cheney (urging sen. patrick leahy to start doing something not\\nbiologically possible).\\n\\na dissenting judge, pierre n. leval, agreed that many people who\\nuse the most adaptable curse word do not intend to refer to sex.\\n(he gave examples: \"a student who gets a disappointing grade on a\\ntest, a cook who burns the roast, or a driver who returns to his\\nparked car to find a parking ticket on the windshield.\") but,\\nwhatever the speaker\\'s intentions, leval added, \"a substantial\\npart of the community, and of the television audience, will\\nunderstand the word as freighted with an offensive sexual\\nconnotation.\"\\n\\nthe commission, on the other hand, has not been entirely\\nconsistent. swearing in \"saving private ryan,\" the steven\\nspielberg war movie? not indecent. swearing by blues masters and\\nothers in a music documentary produced by martin scorsese?\\nindecent.\\n\\nswearing on the \"the early show\" on cbs? not indecent, because\\nthe bad word was part of \"a bona fide news interview\" protected\\nby the first amendment. the foul-mouthed subject of said bona fide\\nnews interview? a contestant on \"survivor: vanuatu.\"\\n\\nthirty years ago, the supreme court allowed the commission to\\ncensor george carlin\\'s famous \"seven dirty words\" monologue. it\\njustified the decision by saying that broadcasting was \"uniquely\\npervasive\" and \"uniquely accessible to children.\"\\n\\npeter chernin, the president of news corp., which owns fox, said\\nmuch had changed since the decision in the carlin case, fcc v.\\npacifica foundation. that decision, he said, is an artifact of a\\nworld without the internet or cable television programming, neither\\nof which is subject to government indecency regulation.\\n\\n\"the government is turning a blind eye to 99 percent of the\\ncontent that\\'s being delivered,\" chernin said. viewers who\\nsubscribe to cable switch between regulatory regimes by changing\\nchannels, he said, leaving broadcasters at \"an inexplicable\\ncompetitive disadvantage.\"\\n\\neven in the pacifica case, the court moved cautiously. it\\nemphasized carlin\\'s \"repetitive, deliberate use\" of swear words\\nand left open the question of whether \"an occasional expletive\"\\nwould be considered indecent.\\n\\nin other settings, the court has protected vulgarity. in 1971,\\nfor instance, the court ruled that it was not obscene to say about\\nthe vietnam draft what cher said about her critics. \"such\\nexpression must be, in some significant way, erotic\" before it\\ncrosses the line into obscenity, justice john marshall harlan wrote\\nfor the majority in cohen v. california. \"it cannot plausibly be\\nmaintained that this vulgar allusion to the selective service\\nsystem would conjure up such psychic stimulation.\"\\n\\njudicial opinions about salty language, like sermons about sin,\\nare the work of amateurs. jesse sheidlower, the editor at large of\\nthe oxford english dictionary, is a professional.\\n\\n\"i spent much of last year revising the oed\\'s entry on it,\"\\nsheidlower said of the word in an interview the other day.\\nsheidlower is also preparing a third edition of his book on the\\nsubject, \"the f-word.\" (that euphemism, according to the\\ndictionary, first appeared in 1973, in this newspaper.)\\n\\nthe power of the word to shock is in decline, sheidlower said,\\nlargely because its core meaning has been blurred. the word, he\\nsaid, \"has been around since the late 15th century, and almost all\\nof the nonsexual uses are quite recent, say, late victorian or\\nlater.\"\\n\\nthe word has seldom been, in any event, the most offensive one\\naround. words suggesting questionable parentage -- \"bastard,\"\\n\"whoreson\" -- were long thought more offensive. blasphemous words\\nhave also gotten people into more trouble. these days, a racial\\nslur can end a career.\\n\\nsheidlower said he had followed the court case and did not find\\nit difficult.\\n\\n\"the outrage that the fcc pretends to feel is false,\" he said.\\n\\n\"i\\'m highly opposed to censorship in any form,\" he added.\\n\"this is censorship. having said that, i don\\'t encourage this word\\nto be very commonly broadcast at all times whenever anyone feels\\nlike it.\"\\n\\non friday, the supreme court turned down a request from c-span\\nfor prompt access to an audiotape of tuesday\\'s argument. the court,\\nwhich occasionally grants such access, gave no reasons. but fox\\'s\\nlead lawyer has said that he will not be relying on euphemisms.\\n\\nchicago is bracing for a gigantic crowd this week in\\ngrant park, the city\\'s iconic front yard, where sen. barack obama\\nhas chosen to spend election night.\\n\\nas many as 70,000 people are expected to attend an event for\\nlocal supporters. all available tickets were swept up days ago, and\\nthousands of people have applied to be on a waiting list. thousands\\nmore -- maybe as many as a million people, mayor richard m. daley\\nhas proudly suggested -- are expected to pile into the downtown\\nparkland and sidewalks and streets surrounding obama\\'s official\\ncelebration.\\n\\n\"this could be a moment of history right here, and it\\'s high\\ntime for it,\" said patricia cadagin, who stood last week peering\\nthrough a new fence around the south end of grant park, one of\\nblocks and blocks of fences erected as part of the elaborate\\nsecurity efforts. cadagin, 82, who said she had voted early for\\nobama, will probably not be here on tuesday night. \"it\\'s going to\\nbe a big crowd and at night, and i\\'m a small woman,\" she said.\\n\"will i be here in spirit? you bet you.\"\\n\\nchicago, it seems, is of two minds about this party. many\\nsupporters in obama\\'s hometown speak with pride of the potential of\\nseeing the first black person claim victory in a presidential\\ncampaign here on the edge of lake michigan, in view of their\\nbeloved skyline. still, in hushed tones, some say they are worried\\nabout his safety in the public park and about how a huge crowd in\\nthis city, which has seen violence after events like basketball\\nchampionships, might respond, win, lose or draw.\\n\\neven city leaders have sent mixed messages. on thursday, daley,\\na fierce obama supporter, seemed to suggest the more the merrier.\\n\"you think i\\'m not going to invite people down?\" he told\\nreporters, according to the chicago tribune. \"this is a\\ncelebration.\"\\n\\na day later, city leaders cautioned chicagoans to behave\\nproperly, warned them that people might be turned away if grant\\npark became too crowded and stood at a city-run news conference\\nbeside ministers who suggested that those without tickets use\\n\"common sense\" and stay in their own neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"we can\\'t have foolishness,\" said the police superintendent,\\njody p. weis. \"we can\\'t have mischief.\"\\n\\nfacing labor shortages back in 1990 but\\never wary of allowing in foreigners, japan made an exception for\\njapanese-brazilians. with their japanese roots, names and faces,\\nthese children and grandchildren of japanese immigrants to brazil\\nwould fit more easily in a society fiercely closed to outsiders, or\\nso the reasoning went.\\n\\nin the two decades since then, despite periodic economic\\ndownturns like the current one, the number of japanese-brazilian\\nworkers in japan has kept growing. they are clustered in industrial\\nregions dotted with factories supplying familiar companies like\\nhonda, sanyo and toyota, whose headquarters gave this city in\\ncentral japan its name.\\n\\nbut perhaps nowhere in this country do japanese and\\njapanese-brazilians rub shoulders with such intensity as in a\\npublic housing complex here called homi estate. built in the 1970s\\nfor young japanese families, homi has a population of 8,891 that is\\nnow nearly evenly split between japanese, at 52 percent, and\\nforeigners, at 48 percent.\\n\\n\"to be honest,\" toshinori fujiwara, 69, a japanese community\\nleader, said, \"i never imagined in my wildest dreams that this\\nwould ever become a multiethnic neighborhood.\"\\n\\na generation from now, more japanese are likely to be making\\nsimilar comments as japan\\'s population ages and its work force\\nshrinks. recently labor shortages have spread from factories to\\nfarms, fishing boats, hospitals and other areas, prompting japan to\\nopen its doors to temporary workers from china and elsewhere in\\nasia.\\n\\nas the demographic squeeze grows tighter, japan may have to open\\nitself further to immigration, experts say, if it is to have the\\nworkers it needs to remain a major industrial power. a homogeneous\\nand insular nation, however, japan is notoriously unwelcoming to\\nimmigrants; koreans who came here during world war ii are still\\ntreated as second-class citizens.\\n\\nto make itself an attractive destination for immigrants, the\\nexperts say, japan will have to undergo a difficult cultural\\ntransformation for which the japanese-brazilians pose an elementary\\ntest case. if even they cannot gain acceptance, what chance will\\nthere be forimmigrant groups that may be ethnically, racially,\\nreligiously and nationally different from native japanese?\\n\\nimmigration is an unpopular and politically delicate topic. but\\nthe country\\'s 317,000 japanese-brazilians -- whose children are\\ngrowing up in japan and, in many cases, coming of age here --\\neffectively make up japan\\'s largest immigrant population.\\n\\nsome audiences for the upcoming film \"milk,\" about the slain\\nsan francisco supervisor and gay politician harvey milk, will\\ncertainly be inspired by his fight against proposition 6, a 1978\\ncalifornia ballot measure that would have expelled gay teachers\\nfrom the state\\'s public schools. others less entranced with milk\\'s\\npolitics will, no doubt, be less impressed.\\n\\nbut, in california, both types of moviegoers will probably feel\\na sense of eerie familiarity. the state is embroiled in a fight\\nover another numbered ballot measure aimed at gays that will be put\\nto voters on tuesday: proposition 8, which would bar same-sex\\nmarriage.\\n\\nin many ways, the battle sparked by this latest proposal echoes\\nthe one that inspired milk\\'s most famous crusade.\\n\\n\"it\\'s surreal,\" said cleve jones, a veteran civil rights\\nactivist who is portrayed by a curly headed emilie hirsch in the\\nfilm. \"it\\'s like there\\'s a 30-year cycle.\"\\n\\ncall it life imitating \"milk,\" or vice versa, but the\\nparallels between the campaign chronicled in the movie and the\\nreal-life battle over proposition 8 are striking. social\\nconservatives pitted against gay activists? check. a republican\\ngovernor (and former movie star) siding with gay californians?\\ncheck. close polls, a nationally watched campaign, the potential\\nfor heartbreak?\\n\\ncheck, check, check.\\n\\none of the most obvious similarities is the role that children\\nhave played in both campaigns as political symbols.\\n\\nin 1978, supporters of proposition 6 suggested that gay people\\nmight aim to \"convert\" and molest children. recent advertisements\\nfor proposition 8 have asserted that gay marriage will be taught in\\nschools to young children.\\n\\n\"i\\'m all for tolerance, everyone\\'s for tolerance, but how do\\nyou explain to a kindergartener what a bisexual is?\" said sonja\\neddings-brown, a spokeswoman for protect marriage, the leading\\ngroup behind proposition 8.\\n\\nopponents of the ballot measure deny the school claim. but it\\nisn\\'t accidental.\\n\\n\"schools are still there as part of the story because whatever\\ntheir politics, families are conservative when it comes to their\\nkids,\" said david l. kirp, a professor of law and public policy at\\nthe university of california at berkeley. \"no family regards their\\nkids as a social experiment.\"\\n\\nproposition 6 was hatched in california just days after the\\nsinger and anti-gay activist anita bryant successfully led an\\neffort to overturn an antidiscrimination law in miami in 1977. (at\\nthe film\\'s premiere in san francisco last tuesday, the crowd hissed\\nwhen bryant appeared on screen.)\\n\\nthe 2008 battle has also been influenced by forces beyond\\ncalifornia\\'s borders, with both sides receiving major financial\\nsupport from groups based outside of the state.\\n\\nmany analysts say the critical factor in defeating proposition 6\\nwas ronald reagan, then the former governor, who said it would be\\ncostly to implement and infringed \"on the basic rights of\\nprivacy.\"\\n\\nthis time around, gov. arnold schwarzenegger, another hollywood\\nrepublican, has come out against proposition 8. and as in 1978, the\\nelection on tuesday is likely to be a nail-biter; a field poll\\nreleased last friday showed 49 percent against proposition 8 and 44\\npercent for the measure.\\n\\nof course, not everyone buys into the parallels between the two\\ncampaigns.\\n\\n\"this is not about the rights of gay people in california,\\nwhich are and should be protected,\" said frank schubert, the\\ncampaign manager for protect marriage. \"this is about marriage.\"\\n\\nfor all the similarities, there are some major differences\\nbetween then and now, particularly the changed political landscape\\nfor gay americans. the 2008 vote in california comes after a\\ndecision by the state supreme court in may to permit same-sex\\nmarriages made california the second state, after massachusetts, to\\ndo so. (connecticut has since become the third.)\\n\\nsuch notions were fanciful in milk\\'s time, said art agnos, a\\nformer mayor of san francisco and sometime political sparring\\npartner with milk.\\n\\n\"had someone said in 1978 that you would have the right to\\nmarry your lover, you\\'d say they were from mars,\" he said.\\n\\njones recalled that the prospect that proposition 6 -- which\\nthreatened people\\'s jobs -- could pass was far more frightening. \"i\\nand all of my contemporaries felt a real sense of physical fear,\"\\nhe said, of the 1978 vote. \"i don\\'t feel that this time.\"\\n\\nfor all that, there\\'s no question passions are still running\\nfairly high. at the film\\'s premiere on tuesday, scores of\\nanti-proposition 8 protesters chanted outside the theater even as\\nactors on the screen inside shouted pro-gay rights slogans from\\nanother era.\\n\\nperhaps the biggest difference today is the lack of charismatic\\nfront men like milk, who was assassinated by a fellow supervisor,\\ndan white, shortly after the defeat of proposition 6. milk, one of\\nthe country\\'s first openly gay elected officials, became the face\\nof the anti-proposition 6 campaign by challenging its major\\nsponsor, a republican state senator from southern california, to a\\nseries of debates.\\n\\nsuch figures are harder to find in this generation of gay\\nleaders, said scott schmidt, who is 33, gay, opposed to proposition\\n8 -- and a republican.\\n\\n\"there are no harvey milks in this campaign.\" he said.\\n\\nsens. barack obama and john mccain have stood (or\\nsat) for 36 debates, endured thousands of interviews, and spent\\nhundreds of millions of dollars on advertisements and the better\\npart of two years trying to convince voters that they are worthy of\\nthe presidency, or at least a vote.\\n\\nbut with only days left until election day, a small cluster of\\nholdouts -- 4 percent, according to a new york times/cbs news poll --\\nis still wrestling with the \"who are you voting for?\" question.\\n\\nwhich raises a follow-up: what is up with these people?\\n\\n\"i do not like being an \\'undecided,\"\\' said a sheepish doug\\nfinke, a 66-year-old executive at an international relocation\\nservice in louisville, ky.\\n\\nfinke, a republican, voted twice for george w. bush. he\\ndescribes himself as an economic

others judged him second-worst, after james\\nbuchanan, whose incompetence set the stage for the civil war. more\\nthan 98 percent of the historians in the poll, conducted through\\nthe history news network, viewed bush\\'s presidency as a failure.\\n\\nbush\\'s presidency imploded not because of any personal\\ncorruption or venality, but largely because he wrenched the united\\nstates out of the international community. his cowboy diplomacy\\n\"defriended\" the united states. he turned a superpower into a\\nrogue country. instead of isolating north korea and iran, he\\nisolated us -- and undermined his own ability to achieve his aims.\\n\\nso here\\'s the top priority for president barack obama or\\npresident john mccain: we must rejoin the world.\\n\\nthere are three general ways in which we can signal a new\\nbeginning and \"refriend\" our allies:\\n\\n-- we should not only close the guantanamo prison but also turn\\nit into an international center for research on tropical diseases\\nthat afflict poor countries. it could thus become an example of\\nmultilateral humanitarianism.\\n\\nthe new president should also start a truth commission to\\ninvestigate torture and other abuses during the \"war on terror.\"\\nthis should not be a bipartisan panel but a nonpartisan one,\\ndominated by retired generals and intelligence figures like brent\\nscowcroft or colin powell.\\n\\nsuch a panel would be respected as fair and authoritative in a\\nway that one composed of bickering democrats and republicans would\\nnot, and it would underscore that we are eager to return to the\\nnorms of the civilized world.\\n\\n-- the new president also should signal that we will no longer\\nconfront problems just by blowing them up. the military toolbox is\\nessential, but it shouldn\\'t be the first option for 21st-century\\nchallenges. you can\\'t bomb climate change.\\n\\nwe also have to pay far more attention to public diplomacy and\\noutreach. our afghanistan and pakistan policy is a mess in part\\nbecause osama bin laden\\'s approval rating in pakistan (34 percent)\\nis almost double america\\'s (19 percent). you know we need a new\\napproach when we lose a public relations competition to a fugitive\\nmass murderer.\\n\\na new approach means a vigorous effort for peace in the middle\\neast. we also need to commit to negotiating with odious countries.\\npresident clinton\\'s engagement policy toward north korea was a\\nconstant headache, for kim jong il was brutally repressive and\\ntried to start a secret uranium program. but north korea didn\\'t\\nproduce nuclear materials for a single weapon during clinton\\'s\\nyears in office; under bush, it has produced enough for a half\\ndozen.\\n\\nso here\\'s the score: clinton diplomacy, 0 weapons; bush\\nfulmination, 6 weapons.\\n\\n-- we must cooperate with other countries on humanitarian\\nefforts, including family planning. one of the bush follies that\\nhas bewildered and antagonized our allies has been the vacuous\\nrefusal to support family planning through the u.n. population\\nfund.\\n\\nthe upshot of the failure to support contraception has been\\nmillions of unwanted pregnancies and abortions. it\\'s difficult to\\nthink of any person alive today whose policies have led to more\\nunnecessary abortions worldwide than bush.\\n\\nfor all my criticisms, though, i would rank bush more gently\\nthan those historians: i would peg him as second worst, after\\nbuchanan. that\\'s because bush has begun effective foreign-aid\\nprograms against aids and malaria that are saving millions of\\nlives. his aids programs have transformed areas of southern africa,\\nbut he so antagonized the world that america never gets adequate\\ncredit for this huge achievement.\\n\\nlook, a friendlier, more multilateral policy will not solve the\\nworld\\'s problems. iran isn\\'t going to give up its nuclear program\\nbecause it likes us, and brawn is necessary to back up brains.\\n\\nbut without global political capital, we don\\'t have the leverage\\nto organize more muscular persuasion. without diplomatic heavy\\nlifting, we can\\'t credibly threaten military heavy smashing.\\n\\nin the aftermath of world war ii, the united states led the\\ninternational effort to construct global institutions to promote\\npeace and prosperity. these included the united nations, the world\\nbank and the international monetary fund, and they served our\\ninterests. now, in the aftermath of the cold war, we need to\\nrethink and refurbish this architecture for the next half century\\nor more.\\n\\nthe united states needs to be a part of the international\\ncriminal court and should lead the push for a new climate change\\ntreaty, for example. the new president should be an architect of\\nthis emerging order, rather than awol as the bush administration\\nhas been.\\n\\nfor eight years, the united states has been in self-imposed\\nexile, and that is one reason bush\\'s presidency has failed on so\\nmany levels. after tuesday, let\\'s rejoin the world.\\n\\ngrowing up in st. louis in the 1950s and \\'60s, deddrick battle\\ncame to believe that the political process was not for people like\\nhim -- a struggling black man whose vote, he was convinced, surely\\nwould not count for much of anything. the thought became ingrained\\nas an adult, almost like common sense. and that partly explains\\nwhy, at age 55, he just registered to vote for the first time a\\nmonth ago.\\n\\nthe other part of the reason is sen. barack obama.\\n\\n\"this is huge,\" battle, a janitor, said after his overnight\\nshift cleaning a movie theater. \"this is bigger than life itself.\\nwhen i was coming up, i always thought they put in who they wanted\\nto put in. i didn\\'t think my vote mattered. but i don\\'t think that\\nanymore.\"\\n\\nacross the country, black men and women like battle, who have\\nlong been disaffected, apolitical, discouraged or just plain bored\\nwith politics, say they have snapped to attention this year,\\naccording to dozens of interviews conducted in the last several\\ndays in six states.\\n\\nover and again, first-time and relatively new voters, far past\\nthe legal voting age, said they were inspired by the singularity of\\nthe 2008 election and the power of obama\\'s magnetism. many also\\nsaid they were loath to miss out on their part in writing what\\ncould be a new chapter of american history -- the chance to vote for\\na black president.\\n\\nthe swelling ranks of the newly enthusiastic are also the result\\nof extensive nationwide voter registration drives and new\\nearly-voting procedures in many states, which have made the process\\neasier and more accessible.\\n\\nfor some black men and women, the sense of pride is\\noverwhelming, as is the feeling that they are participating in what\\ncould become a touchstone moment, something that children and\\ngrandchildren will want to hear about.\\n\\n\"i\\'d feel bad forever if i didn\\'t get out this time,\" said\\nshandell wilcox, 29, of jacksonville, fla., a cafeteria worker.\\n\"i\\'d feel like i didn\\'t do my part to put him in the office.

believe him.\"\\n\\non msnbc, sen. barack obama\\'s surge in the polls was so strong\\nhe was competitive in mccain\\'s home state, arizona. the everyman\\nhero of mccain\\'s campaign, \"joe the

amounting to nothing.\\n\\nwait a minute ... not so fast. click.\\n\\nthings were looking up for mccain, the fox news channel hosts\\nsean hannity and greta van susteren told their viewers at roughly\\nthe same time thursday. he got a boost at an afternoon rally in\\nsandusky, ohio, from none other than joe the plumber, who announced\\nhis intention to vote for \"a real american, john mccain\"; he was\\ngaining new ground in ever-tightening polls, despite the\\noverwhelming bias against him in the mainstream news media; and\\nobama\\'s association with a professor sympathetic to the plo was now\\nat \"the center of the election.\"\\n\\non any given night, there are two distinctly, even extremely,\\ndifferent views of the presidential campaign offered on two of the\\nthree big cable news networks, fox news channel and msnbc, a dual\\nreality that is reflected on the internet as well.\\n\\non one, polls that are \"tightening\" are emphasized over those\\nthat are not, and the rest of the news media is portrayed as\\npapering over questions about obama\\'s past associations with people\\nwho have purportedly anti-american tendencies, which he has not\\nanswered. (\"i feel like we are talking to the germans after hitler\\ncomes to power, saying, \\'oh, well, i didn\\'t know,\"\\' ann coulter,\\nthe conservative commentator, told hannity on thursday.)\\n\\non the other, polls that show tightening are largely ignored,\\nand the race is cast as one between an angry and erratic mccain,\\nwhose desperate, misleading campaign has as low as a 4 percent\\nchance of beating a cool, confident and deserving democratic\\nnominee. (\"he\\'s been a good father, a good citizen; he\\'s paid\\nattention to his country,\" chris matthews, the msnbc host, said\\nwednesday night in addressing those who might be leaning against\\nobama based on race. \"give the guy a break and think about voting\\nfor him.\")\\n\\nand, perhaps unsurprisingly, each campaign is often at war\\nagainst its television antagonist, just as the networks are at war\\nwith each other.\\n\\nmany of the mug shots of drug traffickers that\\nappear in the mexican press show surly-looking roughnecks glaring\\nmenacingly at the camera. an anti-corruption investigation unveiled\\nlast week in the mexican capital, however, made it clear that not\\neverybody enmeshed in the narcotics trade looked the part.\\n\\nthere was a gray-haired, grandfatherly type who was pushing 70,\\nas well as an avuncular figure with a neatly styled goatee and\\nwire-rimmed spectacles perched upon his nose. some of the five men\\nwho found themselves on their way to jail on the front pages of\\nnewspapers wore suits, which made them look more like bureaucrats\\nthan bad guys.\\n\\namong the greatest challenges in mexico\\'s drug war is the fact\\nthat the traffickers fit no type. their ranks include men and\\nwomen, the young and the old. and they can work anywhere: in remote\\ndrug labs, as part of roving assassination squads, even within the\\nupper reaches of the government.\\n\\nit has long been known that drug gangs have infiltrated local\\npolice forces. now it is becoming ever more clear that the problem\\ndoes not stop there. the alarming reality is that many public\\nservants in mexico are serving both the taxpayers and the\\ntraffickers.\\n\\nthe men in suits, it turns out, were both bureaucrats and bad\\nguys, corrupt officials high up in an elite unit of the federal\\nattorney general\\'s office who were feeding secret information to\\nthe feared beltran leyva cartel in exchange for suitcases full of\\ncash.\\n\\ntheir arrest, and the firing of 35 other suspect law-enforcement\\nofficials, represents the most extensive corruption case that this\\ncountry, which knows corruption all too well, has ever seen. and it\\nraises a question that is on the lips of many mexicans: how does\\none know who is dirty and who is clean?\\n\\n\"i\\'m convinced that to stop the crime, we first have to get it\\nout of our own house,\" president felipe calderon, who has made\\nfighting trafficking a crucial part of his presidency, said in a\\nspeech tuesday, after the arrests were announced.\\n\\nthat house is clearly dirty. there is ample evidence that\\nmexicans of all walks of life are willing to join the drug gangs in\\nexchange for cash, including the farmers who abandon traditional\\ncrops and turn to growing marijuana and the accountants who hide\\nthe narco-traffickers\\' profits.\\n\\nobama unaware of status of aunt, campaign says reporting was contributed by abby goodnough, eric lipton, michael luo and jeff zeleny.\\n\\nwashington

uphill climb that\\'s just too steep.\" within the republican\\nparty and the conservative movement, the recriminations have\\nalready begun.\\n\\nfor reporters and editors at the times responsible for news\\nabout the election -- as opposed to opinions, like blow\\'s -- this is\\na tricky time. they have to walk a careful line, reporting what\\nappears to be current reality without predicting an outcome that\\nnobody can be certain of, no matter what polls indicate. a lot is\\nat stake: the newspaper\\'s credibility and voters\\' right to decide\\nthe winner without being discouraged by coverage suggesting that\\nthe result is inevitable.\\n\\nthe times and other news media got burned once before this year,\\nin the new hampshire primary. the coverage, reflecting respected\\npolls and what reporters thought they saw on the ground, strongly\\nsuggested that obama, fresh from victory in the iowa caucuses, was\\ngoing to defeat hillary clinton. the times published a front-page\\narticle on the day of the voting that reported on a possible\\nshake-up in the clinton campaign staff and quoted an unnamed\\nsupporter as saying, \"we\\'re all resolved to the probability that\\nshe\\'s not going to win new hampshire, and the mood has turned very\\ndespondent -- fatalistic, probably.\" two days later, the newspaper\\nwas asking how pollsters and news organizations failed to see the\\nclinton victory coming.\\n\\nnow, times editors and reporters say they are well aware of the\\ndanger of getting too far in front of events. still, i think the\\ncoverage over time has created a strong expectation of an obama\\nvictory and a democratic sweep in congress. if it does not happen,\\nthe times and many other news organizations will have a lot of\\nexplaining to do.\\n\\nthe expectation has been built bit by bit in the times: an\\nonline video about the fight for pennsylvania that briefly\\nmentioned that mccain was relying on christian voters and then\\ndwelled at length on obama\\'s thorough organizing to get out his\\nsupporters, a front-page article about the risks and rewards for\\ndemocrats if they wind up controlling both the white house and\\ncongress, an online article about whether sarah palin turned out to\\nbe a drag on the republican ticket. that one said mccain might\\nstill win but, \"anticipating that he will fall short, the\\npre-postmortems have already begun.\"\\n\\njill abramson, the managing editor for news, said, \"it is\\ndifficult, even when you do the most diligent editing, not to leave\\nthe appearance\" of calling the winner. she said editors talk daily\\nabout avoiding stories with \"a predictive tone or premise.\"\\n\\nrichard stevenson, the editor in charge of campaign coverage,\\nsaid: \"there is a great degree of angst now among republicans\\nabout their prospects for president and down the ballot. there is a\\ngreat degree of optimism among democrats. that all leads you to a\\nconclusion right now, as a snapshot in time, that obama is in a\\nbetter position than mccain is in. that\\'s the reality, and we\\'re\\nnot going to put our finger on the scale to pretend otherwise.\"\\n\\nadam nagourney, the chief political correspondent, said, \"i\\ndon\\'t think it\\'s over, and i think coverage that suggests it is is\\nirresponsible.\" still, he said, \"you\\'ve got to reflect what\\'s\\ngoing on.\" what\\'s going on is that obama is ahead in every\\nnational poll; he is drawing huge crowds and raising record amounts\\nof money; he is leading or tied in critical states that mccain must\\nwin to have any chance; and mccain is saddled with an apparent\\nrecession, an unpopular war and an unpopular president from his\\nparty. none of which means he cannot win.\\n\\nnagourney wrote a front-page article on oct. 24, under the\\nheadline, \"in mccain\\'s uphill battle, winning is an option,\" that\\nexplored the ways the republican candidate could prevail. the\\narticle said mccain would have to hold republican states where\\nobama has him on the run and either convert a democratic state like\\npennsylvania or pick up a combination of swing states. \"not easy,\\nbut not impossible either,\" it said.\\n\\nthe latest times/cbs news poll on friday, giving obama an\\n11-point lead among likely voters nationally, indicated that mccain\\nhad a long way to go. but presidential elections are not decided by\\nthe national popular vote; they are won state by state, and polls\\nin critical states have varied widely. at least 10 surveys of\\npennsylvania voters were released last week, showing obama\\'s lead\\nanywhere from 14 to 4 points.\\n\\nlarry harris of mason-dixon polling and research, which found\\nthe smallest obama margin, said, \"the cake has not been baked.\"\\nmason-dixon has found similarly close margins in florida, virginia\\nand other crucial states. though polls clearly inform the coverage,\\nthe times has treated them with great and appropriate caution in a\\nyear when an african-american is atop one ticket for the first time\\nand the outcome could depend on groups -- the young, minorities --\\nthat traditionally do not turn out in proportion to their numbers.\\n\\n\"i have no idea who\\'s going to win,\" said janet elder, the\\neditor in charge of polling. what the times/cbs poll can tell you\\n\"is what was on the minds of voters and nonvoters on the days we\\ncalled them.\"\\n\\nthere are only two days left until the next president is\\nelected. i think the times would be wise, in the words of my former\\ncolleague tom fiedler, dean of the college of communication at\\nboston university, to \"forgo the temptation of the horse race\"\\nand focus on issues and what the candidates are saying. that is\\njust what the paper did thursday, with articles on their positions\\non student loans and summarizing their final stump speeches.\\n\\nbest not to join blow on his limb. as abramson, a former\\nwashington bureau chief, told me, \"what i know from politics is,\\nanything can happen.\"\\n\\nfor the last two decades, the easiest way to invoke\\ndovishness in israel has been to utter the words \"yossi beilin.\"\\nthe politician who navigated mutual recognition between israel and\\nthe palestine liberation organization in the early 1990s and has\\nnever stopped believing, beilin has a unique place in the israeli\\npolitical galaxy, admired and reviled for his relentlessness.\\n\\nso it is of some consequence that last week, as new elections\\nwere announced and the chances of a year-end palestinian-israeli\\nagreement seemed slim to nonexistent, beilin revealed that he was\\nleaving parliament 20 years after he was first elected, and\\nstepping away from political life 31 years after shimon peres named\\nhim the labor party\\'s spokesman.\\n\\nisrael\\'s political landscape has changed drastically since the\\n1970s. peres, now the country\\'s ceremonial president, and beilin, a\\nmember of the declining left-wing meretz party, have both abandoned\\nlabor, whose own fortunes have been sinking steadily.\\n\\nstill, beilin\\'s decision to leave public life and set up a\\nprivate company offers a lens through which to view israeli\\npolitics. the arc of his career describes the fortunes of\\npeacemaking. he said last week that he was leaving in triumph,\\nsince his support for an end to occupation of palestinian\\nterritories and the creation of a palestinian state, once radical\\npositions, are today mainstream. there is no denying that shift in\\npublic opinion and official policy. but it is impossible not to see\\nthe move also as a defeat -- of beilin\\'s understated style in an\\noverheated environment, and of his goals, with no palestinian state\\non the horizon.\\n\\nmost successful israeli politicians resemble ariel sharon --\\nopen-shirted men with strong military backgrounds, thick fingers\\nand quick tempers. but the soft-voiced beilin, with his cross gold\\npens and carefully knotted ties, was a different species, one that\\nleft israelis bemused. at his political height, that mattered\\nlittle since he was less a leader of the people than a leader of\\nthe leaders, a behind-the-scenes actor who persuaded prime minister\\nyitzhak rabin in 1993 that yasser arafat wanted peace. that feat\\nwas all the more remarkable because, as beilin noted in a two-hour\\nconversation in his office last week, he and rabin never liked each\\nother.\\n\\nit is a tribute to beilin -- to his powerful intellect and keen\\ninterpersonal skills -- that despite his demure style and lack of\\ngood-old-boy credentials, his political fortunes rose remarkably in\\nthe 1990s as the oslo peace process that he set in motion took over\\nisraeli politics. in the labor primaries at one point, he won the\\nno. 2 spot. twice he was appointed a minister. for a while, if you\\nwanted to know what was next on israel\\'s geopolitical agenda, you\\nconsulted beilin.\\n\\nbut when peacemaking reached a dead end and the second intifada\\nbroke out in late 2000, sending israel into a fury of suicide\\nbombings and fierce military counterattacks that killed thousands,\\nbeilin lost his sheen. he was accused of being a snake-oil\\nsalesman, responsible for luring israelis into the false belief\\nthat they had a peace partner. the exotic fellow with the ph.d. and\\nattache case was anathema.\\n\\nbeilin said he felt betrayed by the palestinians but that israel\\nhad mishandled things as well. he argued that nothing essential\\nabout the situation had changed, that a deal remained possible. he\\nfound a new home in meretz and continued his work. but he never\\nrecovered his place in public life, even after negotiations with\\nthe palestinians again took center stage. three years ago, the new\\nkadima party of sharon and ehud olmert came to power, and its\\noutlook today seems hard to distinguish from his -- although no one\\nfeels a need to give him credit.\\n\\nwhen olmert gave a departing newspaper interview in september,\\nhe sounded exactly like beilin of the last 20 years. \"i could not\\nhave said it better than he did,\" beilin mused last week. \"i told\\nhim that sometimes i read his speeches and am not sure that i\\ndidn\\'t write them.\"\\n\\nbut even beilin recognizes that while his successors may sound\\nlike him, they are not taking his advice on details and tactics. he\\nrecoils, for example, at arguments against yielding any part of\\neast jerusalem to the palestinians. \"israel is going to pay a\\ncrazy price because it is not ready to give up some palestinian\\nneighborhoods in jerusalem that no jew has ever visited,\" he said.\\n\"yet giving up on that means giving up 250,000 palestinians who\\ndon\\'t want to live under israeli sovereignty.\"\\n\\nhe sees two clocks ticking. one is demographic, with the\\njewish-palestinian ratio in israel and

e-mail: sicheia@nytimes.com.) david margolick is a contributing editor at conde nast portfolio.      robert jordan is a left-wing radical, or was modeled after\\nseveral of them. he palled around with terrorists, or at least\\npeople whom many americans, of his era and beyond, so thought. his\\nspecialty is blowing things up for a cause. he is at minimum a\\nsocialist, someone so eager to spread wealth around that he\\'d lose\\nhis life to do it.\\n\\nrobert jordan is also honorable, steadfast, selfless,\\ndetermined, stoic, generous, tolerant, courageous, conscientious,\\nforgiving, altruistic, tender, wise, loyal, independent, taciturn,\\ndisciplined, dutiful, patient, exacting, empathetic, idealistic,\\nintrospective, charismatic and handsome. no wonder the beautiful\\nmaria falls for him the first time she sees him, and the earth\\nmoves beneath the two the first time they make love.\\n\\nrobert jordan is the hero of ernest hemingway\\'s \"for whom the\\nbell tolls,\" an american fighting franco\\'s fascists in the spanish\\ncivil war. and despite his radical roots, he\\'s a literary sensation\\nduring this election season. sen. barack obama told rolling stone\\nthat hemingway\\'s novel, published in 1940, is one of the three\\nbooks that most inspired him. as for sen. john mccain, few men,\\nreal or fictional, have influenced him as much as jordan.\\n\\nmccain begins his 2002 book, \"worth the fighting for\" (a\\nphrase lifted from jordan\\'s dying soliloquy), with an extraordinary\\npaean to the character, whom he first encountered at age 12. having\\nfound two four-leaf clovers, young john pulled \"for whom the bell\\ntolls\" off his father\\'s bookcase so he could press them. he and\\nrobert have been together ever since, even in hanoi. \"i knew that\\nif he were in the next cell to mine, he would be stoic, he would be\\nstrong, he would be tough, he wouldn\\'t give up,\" mccain said in a\\nradio interview in 2002. \"and robert would expect me to do the\\nsame thing.\"\\n\\namerica never embraced the more than 3,000 of its sons and\\ndaughters -- many of them communists and more than half of whom were\\nkilled -- who fought in spain between 1936 and 1938. rather, they\\nwere persecuted, subpoenaed and passed over for jobs when they came\\nhome. as late as 1984, ronald reagan said that most americans still\\nbelieved they had fought on the wrong side. the few veterans of\\nthat fight still alive remain unapologetically to the left; mccain\\nwon\\'t find many votes among them. \"he\\'s the very antithesis of\\nwhat we stood for,\" said mark billings, a mechanic during the\\nspanish civil war who now lives in el cerrito, calif. (he says he\\nis only guardedly optimistic about obama.)\\n\\nhow is it, then, that the radicals\\' literary stand-in appeals to\\ntwo mainstream presidential candidates who agree on little else?\\nwell, take an author who was politically skeptical, commercially\\nsavvy and damned good. throw in a movie starring gary cooper and\\ningrid bergman. add ignorance or amnesia, garnish with the passage\\nof time, and you get a role model that comfortably serves two.\\n\\n\"both candidates regard themselves as paladins of democracy,\\nand would be reluctant to acknowledge that their \\'hero\\' might have\\nbeen a communist,\" said paul preston of the london school of\\neconomics, an authority on the spanish civil war. james benet of\\nforestville, calif., who drove ambulances in spain, agreed: \"if\\nrobert jordan were alive he\\'d be way to the left of those guys, and\\nhe\\'d be a lot harder for them to admire.\"\\n\\nhemingway never revealed on whom he based jordan, who taught\\nspanish at the university of montana before heading to spain. cecil\\neby of the university of michigan proposed robert merriman, who,\\nlike jordan, was a westerner and a teacher (he had studied\\neconomics in moscow). but merriman, who was killed in 1938, was\\nnever a guerrilla behind enemy lines, as jordan was. three others\\nwhom veterans speculate could have been models -- michael jimenez,\\nwilliam aalto, and irving goff -- were, in fact, guerrillas; goff, a\\nnew yorker who died in 1989, actually blew up bridges, but unlike\\nmerriman, he never met hemingway. (he once joked that he never met\\ningrid bergman, either; if he had, he said, \"i might still be\\nthere.\") large swaths of jordan, including his \"red, black,\\nblinding\" temper and his father\\'s suicide, clearly come from\\nhemingway himself.\\n\\namong the americans in what later became known as the abraham\\nlincoln brigade, few claimed to be jordan\\'s prototype. most hated\\nthe book, in which hemingway trashed the people leading the fight\\nfor the embattled spanish republic, particularly the soviets. in\\nthe daily worker, mike gold dismissed hemingway as a rich,\\nalcoholic voyeur, \"a sportsman and a tourist.\" the book\\nrepresented \"a picture so drastically mutilated and distorted as\\nto slander the cause for which we fought,\" the veterans of the\\nabraham lincoln brigade declared in an open letter to hemingway.\\n\\nand they hated robert jordan, mostly for what peter carroll,\\nauthor of \"the odyssey of the abraham lincoln brigade,\" called\\nhis \"extreme individualism.\" jordan was no ideologue. \"nobody\\nowned his mind, nor his faculties for seeing and hearing,\"\\nhemingway wrote. when jordan dreams of marx, it is groucho, not\\nkarl; he fantasizes about taking maria to see \"a night at the\\nopera\" in madrid once the fighting stops.\\n\\nallen josephs, a hemingway scholar at the university of west\\nflorida, says hemingway created jordan as a communist, but changed\\nhis affiliation to \"anti-fascist\" after his publisher, charles\\nscribner, objected. the switch fit hemingway\\'s own politics and,\\nnot coincidentally, made jordan more commercially acceptable. (so\\ntoo, surely, did making him a stately westerner rather than a new\\nyork jew, as so many of the americans hemingway encountered in\\nspain were.)\\n\\njordan\\'s willingness to give his life to a cause greater than\\nhimself would appeal to anyone from mccain\\'s military background,\\nsaid william braasch watson, a hemingway scholar and retired\\nprofessor of history at the massachusetts institute of technology.\\nand that appeal, watson added, would only have grown in hanoi,\\nwhere jordan\\'s long interior monologues -- questioning himself, his\\ncharacter, his future -- would have anticipated mccain\\'s\\nexperiences.\\n\\nwatson said he could see jordan\\'s appeal to obama, too. \"like\\njordan, obama\\'s a person with a mission and a larger vision,\" he\\nsaid. \"he, too, seems remarkably self-contained -- somewhat aloof,\\neven -- and he\\'s driven to accomplish his goal.\"\\n\\nif mccain does not win on election day, he may have even more\\nreason to identify with robert jordan. part of what jordan has\\ntaught him, mccain has said, is to \"accept your fate, accept your\\nfate.\" but no matter who prevails come tuesday, one winner is\\nalready clear: the much-out-of-fashion hemingway himself. in the\\npolitical-literary world, he\\'s this year\\'s comeback kid.\\n\\nplace an opponent in his path, and stephon marbury will skip\\npast him. place an entire defense in front of him, and marbury will\\nfind a seam to the basket. from his earliest days as a basketball\\nprodigy in coney island, marbury has been able to dribble, pass or\\nshoot his way out of any problem on the court.\\n\\nyet marbury finds his career at a crossroads, and he is missing\\nthe most vital tool in a troubled athlete\\'s arsenal: an agent.\\nmarbury has not employed one in eight years, and it is probably\\nhurting his ability to break free of the knicks and start fresh.\\nthat is, at least, the view of a number of agents surveyed last\\nweek. and it is shared by many nba team executives, who are used to\\nresolving player conflicts by working through their paid advocates.\\n\\n\"you need someone who is looking out for your interests but is\\nalso assessing your situation on multiple levels, from your\\nperspective,\" said lon babby, a washington-based nba agent, whose\\nclients include tim duncan, grant hill and ray allen. \"sometimes\\nyou lose the forest for the trees if you don\\'t have someone who can\\nstep back and analyze things with some distance and perspective.\"\\n\\nbabby is not privy to marbury\\'s situation and was speaking\\ngenerally about the business. but he is well versed in the sort of\\nplayer-team standoff that now threatens marbury\\'s career.\\n\\nthe knicks no longer want marbury around. coach mike d\\'antoni\\nplaced him on the inactive list on friday night, and marbury has\\nmost likely played his last game in a knicks uniform. yet he\\nremains on the roster because of a practically untradeable contract\\nand his refusal to negotiate a buyout. marbury is set to earn $21.9\\nmillion this season, the last year of his deal.\\n\\nsuch stalemates are not uncommon in the nba. the typical\\nsolution has the parties agree to a slightly reduced payout, on the\\npremise that the player will recoup the loss when he signs with\\nanother team. often, the player\\'s agent has suitors lined up, and\\nconcrete offers in hand.\\n\\nbut marbury has not had a certified player agent since june\\n2000, when he parted ways with david falk. (falk said he resigned;\\nmarbury said he fired him.) marbury has a rocky history with\\nagents. he fired his first agent, eric fleisher, in 1998.\\n\\nmarbury represented himself when he signed his last contract, a\\nfour-year, $76 million extension with the phoenix suns. that deal\\nwas consummated in october 2003, three months before the suns\\ntraded him to the knicks.\\n\\nbecause the suns offered marbury the maximum allowed under nba\\nrules, the talks were fairly simple.\\n\\n\"there wasn\\'t no need for me to use an agent,\" marbury said\\nlast week. \"there wasn\\'t no need for me to give somebody 4 percent\\nor 3 percent of my money when i can go do the same thing that they\\nwould go do.\"\\n\\nasked if he needed an agent now, to help him find a new team,\\nmarbury said: \"i don\\'t want to go nowhere. i want to stay right\\nhere.\"\\n\\nhe declined to say whether anyone else was advising him and\\nwould not answer other questions on the matter.\\n\\nit is rare for players to represent themselves. only eight\\ncurrent nba players are without an agent, according to a database\\ncompiled by draftexpress.com. the group includes gilbert arenas,\\nwho negotiated his contract with the washington wizards last\\nsummer.\\n\\nmoney matters aside, marbury needs representation for some\\npractical reasons, said several agents, speaking anonymously\\nbecause marbury is not their client. the most basic reason is this:\\nteams that want to sign marbury have no one to call to gauge his\\ninterest.\\n\\na good agent would know which teams need a veteran point guard\\nand what they are willing to pay. with the knicks\\' permission, the\\nagent could solicit tentative offers before negotiating a buyout --\\nor even attempt to broker a trade.\\n\\nperhaps most critically, an agent could convince marbury that\\naccepting less money now is in his best interest because he can\\nrecoup the loss next summer as a free agent. in general, players\\nare poor judges of their value, sometimes overestimating and\\nsometimes underestimating it. two agents invoked the adage that a\\nman who represents himself has a fool for a client.\\n\\n\"he\\'s trying to answer all the questions for himself, and he\\nhas no sounding board,\" a west coast-based agent said.\\n\\nif marbury stands firm, refuses a buyout and sits on the bench\\nall season, his market value can only decline, the agents said.\\nmarbury turns 32 in february. he has not played a full season since\\n2004-05. and he has a history of clashing with coaches and\\nteammates.\\n\\n\"you tell him there\\'s no future in new york for you,\" an east\\ncoast-based agent said. \"you have two choices: you can buy out of\\nthe contract and go somewhere else and get a fresh start, or you\\ncan be stubborn and sit at home and tell people how great you were\\nin the \\'90s.\"\\n\\nthe absence of a paid advocate certainly hurt marbury in past\\nskirmishes with knicks management. last year, marbury abandoned the\\nteam during a trip after isiah thomas, then the coach, threatened\\nto bench him. marbury was docked one game\\'s pay. he filed a\\ngrievance with the help of the players union, claiming that thomas\\ngave him permission to leave.\\n\\nan agent might have advised marbury to stay put while trying to\\nresolve the dispute. a more aggressive agent might have immediately\\ndemanded a trade or a buyout.\\n\\nagents also advise players on personal finance, business\\ninvestments, charity work and medical issues. most have strong\\nrelationships with general managers and know how to sell them a\\ndifficult player. agents also help make their clients\\' cases to the\\nnews media.\\n\\nmore than anything, an agent serves as a slightly detached\\nadviser, who can keep a player focused on the bigger picture. but\\nthe advice is valuable only if the player listens.\\n\\n\"sometimes,\" the east coast agent said, \"you have to tell the\\nclient, \\'wake up and smell the coffee.\"\\'\\n\\non tuesday the nation\\'s fretful, hopeful voters will finally\\nhave their say, and none of the rigorously calibrated polls or\\ndemographically incisive analysts out there can tell us with any\\ncertainty what will happen.\\n\\nwill one candidate win by millions, or lose by thousands? if\\nthere is a clear victor, will he be the first black american ever\\nelected to the presidency, or the oldest american ever to win a\\nfirst term?\\n\\nwe don\\'t need to know the answers to be certain of this much: no\\nmatter the outcome, it will be the climax of one of the most\\nextraordinary presidential elections in this nation\\'s 232-year\\nhistory, and \"the first\" and \"the oldest\" capture only some of\\nwhat has made it so remarkable.\\n\\nwhether judged by the milestones reached, the paradigms\\nchallenged, the passions stirred or simply the numbers -- the 85\\npercent of americans who believe the country is on the wrong track,\\nor the record-demolishing $640 million fundraising mark that barack\\nobama passed by mid-october -- the election of 2008 actually\\nwarrants the sorts of adjectives and phrases that are often just\\njournalistic tics: epochal, pivotal, historic, once-in-a-lifetime.\\n\\nit\\'s been so rich with precedent and incident -- and so very,\\nvery long -- that we have, if anything, undervalued and even lost\\nsight of its significance at times. in these final hours there\\'s\\nsome sense in pausing, pulling back and taking the broad measure of\\na contest that\\'s sure to affect not only this country\\'s civic life\\nbut also its emotional and psychological landscape for some time to\\ncome.\\n\\nmuch of its impact boils down, yes, to race and gender, obama\\nand hillary rodham clinton and sarah palin, who could become the\\nnation\\'s first female vice president.\\n\\nin this fiercely waged election, long-standing barriers were\\nchallenged and toppled, at times to the seeming surprise of the\\nperson doing the toppling.\\n\\nthink back. when obama took the stage in iowa after his victory\\nin the state\\'s caucuses last january, he was not yet the favorite\\nfor the democratic nomination, and he was a long way from becoming\\nthe general-election frontrunner.\\n\\nin videotape from that night, you can see and sense an\\nastonishment and exhilaration -- in him, around him -- that seem\\nalmost quaint just 10 months later.\\n\\n\"they said this day would never come,\" he tells a euphoric\\niowa crowd, and not just his eyes but the whole of him twinkles,\\ngleams. \"they said our sights were set too high.\"\\n\\nwhile he\\'s talking specifically about himself and his campaign\\ntroops, it\\'s impossible not to hear in his words a statement about\\nall minorities in america, for whom the week-by-week,\\nmonth-by-month advance of his candidacy would hold an especially\\npowerful message.\\n\\nthe writer ta-nehisi coates observed that as obama\\'s quest for\\nthe presidency caught fire, \"i knew, for the first time in my\\nlife, that it would be a good year to be black.\"\\n\\n\"consider this fact: the most famous black man in america isn\\'t\\ndribbling a ball or clutching a microphone,\" coates continued, in\\na recent essay for time magazine. \"he has no prison record. he has\\nnot built a career on four-letter words.\"\\n\\n\"words like hope, change and progress might seem like naive\\ncampaign sloganeering in a dark age,\" coates further wrote. \"but\\nthink of the way those words ring for a people whose forebears\\nmarched into billy clubs and dogs, whose ancestors fled north by\\nstarlight, feeling the moss on the backs of trees.\"\\n\\nover the course of a campaign that was part therapy session,\\npart consciousness-raising seminar, a few of the principal players\\ntook on meanings much, much larger than themselves. obama and\\nclinton became vessels for the aspirations and frustrations of\\nentire classes of aggrieved americans. their journeys encouraged\\nthe airing of hurts and the discussion of difficult issues.\\n\\nin philadelphia in march, obama delivered a set-piece speech\\nthat sought to do nothing less than explain centuries of racial\\nenmity and move americans past it. in new hampshire in january,\\nclinton welled with tears that became catalysts for a charged\\nexamination of the treatment of women in american life.\\n\\nwas sexism more potent than racism? this was the sort of\\nimpossible question raised on television shows and in newspapers,\\nat restaurant counters and kitchen tables, revolving around clinton\\nin winter and spring, palin in summer and fall.\\n\\nfor many of clinton\\'s supporters she was everywoman, called on\\nto prove her toughness without wholly abandoning her softness,\\nasked in the end to yield once more to an ambitious, impatient man.\\ncome tuesday, will these supporters be haunted anew by what might\\nhave been? and will they be haunted more by an obama victory or an\\nobama defeat?\\n\\nhow will some younger voters react if mccain prevails? or some\\nolder ones if obama does? in recent weeks, the ire and ugly\\ncatcalls of some supporters of the mccain-palin ticket have\\nsuggested a division in this election that goes well beyond tax\\npolicy or iraq strategy.\\n\\nthere\\'s more generational, cultural and stylistic difference\\nbetween mccain and obama, ages 72 and 47, than between rivals in\\nmost presidential contests over the last half-century.\\n\\nbill clinton and the first president bush were three years\\ncloser in age, and while clinton\\'s victory marked the ascension of\\nbaby boomers, obama\\'s election would be emblematic of something\\nmore profound: that the multicultural, postracial society so often\\ndiscussed in the news media but so seldom affirmed in public life\\nwas now, literally, the face of our nation. clinton was fleetwood\\nmac. obama is india.arie.\\n\\ncandidates in many past presidential contests lacked life\\nstories as compelling as those of obama, the son of a man from\\nkenya and a woman from kansas, and mccain, who endured years of\\nimprisonment and torture in vietnam.\\n\\nbut these two weren\\'t the only vivid characters in a campaign\\nthat, purely as narrative, proved sensational.\\n\\nwho would have believed, at its start, that mike huckabee was\\ngoing to outlast rudy giuliani? that john edwards\\' pledges of\\nsupport for his seriously ill wife were going to give way to a\\npublic apology for infidelity?\\n\\nthat obama would choose a running mate who once described him,\\nin terms of plausible aspirants to the white house, as \"the first\\nmainstream african-american who is articulate and bright and\\nclean?\"\\n\\nthat mccain would choose a running mate who could field-dress a\\nmoose and would take the stage at the republican convention with a\\npregnant, unwed teenage daughter in tow?\\n\\nperhaps that\\'s one reason voters paid such close attention. in\\nany case, the 2008 election contradicted any and all claims that\\namericans were alienated from politics.\\n\\nalthough cable news was supposed to be moribund, programs\\ndevoted to politics got some of their best ratings in years.\\n\"saturday night live\" sailed temporarily into prime time on the\\nwinds of political parody. an average of about 34.5 million viewers\\na night tuned into the republican convention, versus 22.6 million\\nin 2004. for the democratic convention, viewership rose to an\\naverage of 30.2 million from 20.4 million four years ago.\\n\\n\"we\\'re seeing record levels of interest in the campaign,\" said\\nmichael p. mcdonald, a senior fellow at the brookings institution\\nand an associate professor at george mason university who studies\\nvoting patterns. mcdonald cited evidence like new voter\\nregistration and responses in polls that asked how interested in\\nthe election voters were.\\n\\nand he extrapolated from that to predict turnout of 64 percent,\\nwhich would be the highest since 1908, when, he said, 65.7 percent\\nof those americans eligible to vote did. he said that just under 64\\npercent voted in the kennedy-nixon election of 1960, adding that\\n2008 turnout could top that.\\n\\none of the most striking measures of voters\\' engagement has been\\nobama\\'s fundraising, built in large measure on small donations made\\nover the internet. the final total may well exceed $700 million. in\\nthe 2004 election, the presidential candidates combined raised $684\\nmillion before their conventions, after which president bush and\\nsen. john f. kerry took public financing.\\n\\nonly mccain did that this time, and as a condition has had to\\nlimit his spending between the convention and election day to $84\\nmillion. obama broke an early promise to take public financing and\\nthus evaded such limits. he spent $21 million on television\\nadvertising alone during one week in october.\\n\\nif obama wins by a wide margin on tuesday, that victory will\\nreflect more than strides in race relations, thirst for change and\\nthe strength of his appeal. it will also reflect the power of\\nmoney, and it could usher in the end of general-election candidates\\nparticipating in the public financing system.\\n\\nan obama victory could redraw the political map, patches of red\\nbecoming blue or at least purple, swaths of the south no longer\\nconceded to republicans from the start.\\n\\nso many other assumptions have been upended already. a black man\\nwith an exotic-sounding name wasn\\'t supposed to flourish in an\\noverwhelmingly white state like iowa, but obama beat edwards and\\nclinton there by 8 percentage points.\\n\\nsomeone who failed to win democratic primaries in new hampshire,\\nohio, pennsylvania, california, new york and new jersey wouldn\\'t\\nseem to be on a successful path to the democratic nomination, but\\nobama was.\\n\\nhe hasn\\'t fit neatly into the usual paradigms, and that could\\nmanifest itself in some way in tuesday\\'s voting -- if this election,\\nlike the 1980 race between president jimmy carter and ronald\\nreagan, will reveal some new political dynamics and yield some new\\npolitical alignments.\\n\\nare we still the center-right country we\\'ve heard so much about\\nover the last decade? obama\\'s success even to this point calls that\\ninto question, just as mccain\\'s triumph in the republican primaries\\nraises doubts about the putative sway of religious conservatives\\nwithin -- and beyond -- his party. the 2008 election suggests an\\nevolving body politic, not a palsied one.\\n\\nthen again it\\'s hard to tell, because what may ultimately be\\nmost extraordinary about this election is its context. the country\\nis facing what is widely regarded as the greatest financial crisis\\nsince the depression, and that\\'s not just election-season\\nhyperbole. america is fighting wars in both iraq and afghanistan.\\nand its claim to global leadership is being undercut by russia,\\nwhich defied the will of the west in invading georgia last summer,\\nand china, which staged an olympics that was the envy of the world.\\n\\nthe 2008 presidential election stands out from so many before\\nit, and will have repercussions for so many after it, because it\\'s\\na decision about who can guide us through the worst of times. we\\'re\\nin trouble if we get it wrong. and maybe even if we get it right.\\n\\nafter nearly a decade of running marathons -- 19 races that add\\nup to 497.8 pounding miles -- catherine ndereba insists there is one\\nthing she cannot live without.\\n\\nnot her coach. not her agent. not even the occasional philly\\ncheese steak, her reward for training 90 to 100 miles a week.\\n\\nit is her massage therapist.\\n\\n\"when i was younger, i never used to have a lot of fatigue in\\nmy muscles -- never,\" ndereba, 36, said recently in norristown,\\npa., her training base in the united states. \"but now, if i don\\'t\\nhave a massage at least twice a week, i feel like i can\\'t move.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t feel old; i still feel like i\\'m in my 20s. but, yes,\\nsometimes, there are a few signs that my body doesn\\'t agree.\"\\n\\nndereba, a four-time winner of the boston marathon and two-time\\nolympic silver medalist for kenya, is among the 41 elite women in\\nthe field for sunday\\'s new york city marathon. and many of them\\nhave probably noticed uncharacteristically sore muscles or creaky\\njoints.\\n\\ntheir average age is about 33, one of the oldest groups of elite\\nwomen, if not the oldest, in the history of the race, organizers\\nsaid. two-thirds are 30 or older, including the favorites paula\\nradcliffe, 34, and gete wami, 33. nearly half are 35 and older.\\n\\n\"it\\'s unusual to see so many really good women of that age, but\\nthis is probably a fluke that they are all so good at once,\" mary\\nwittenberg, the race director, said. \"i do expect to see a\\nchanging of the guard because we are probably looking at the end of\\na superstar generation.\"\\n\\n\"gete, paula, catherine are in a class by themselves, but time\\nis ticking,\" she added. \"they are probably getting close to the\\npoint of diminishing returns.\"\\n\\nthose runners are not pioneers in racing marathons -- and often\\nwinning -- into their 30s. at that age, many distance runners are in\\ntheir prime, some experts say, because their bodies are accustomed\\nto the mileage required to train for the 26.2-mile races.\\n\\nmany also started running marathons only after they had built a\\nfoundation in shorter races, to prevent burnout and injuries. a\\nwidespread belief is that elite runners have a limited number of\\nmarathons in them, so they also tend to use their time in\\ncompetition wisely.\\n\\ngrete waitz was 35 in 1988 when she won her ninth new york city\\nmarathon. the year before, the british runner priscilla welch was a\\nseemingly ancient 42 when she crossed the finish line first.\\n\\nthis year in beijing, constantina tomescu of romania won the\\nolympic marathon at 38. in september, irina mikitenko, 36, won the\\nberlin marathon. she began running marathons last year, she said,\\nbecause she was mentally tough enough to do so after having two\\nchildren.\\n\\nto some, the current wave of older women succeeding in marathons\\nmakes sense. more women are running the distance these days, they\\nsay, so more they are training at a higher level.\\n\\nmore women are also sticking with the marathon because of the\\neconomic incentive, said ryan lamppa, a researcher for running usa,\\na nonprofit organization that tracks trends in distance running.\\n\\ntop runners like radcliffe and her peers consistently receive\\nsix-figures appearance fees from big-city marathons, agents and\\nrace directors said. so a hefty payday is guaranteed just for\\nshowing up and finishing. five of the women in sunday\\'s field have\\nmade at least $1 million in prize money in their careers, according\\nto the association of road racing statisticians. the top 10 women\\nsunday will also receive prize money.\\n\\nfirst place is worth $130,000 of the $301,000 purse, second\\nplace $65,000, third $40,000, fourth $25,000, fifth $15,000 and so\\non down to $1,000 for 10th place. in addition, bonuses ranging from\\n$5,000 to $70,000 are paid for reaching certain time standards.\\n\\ntwenty years ago, though, the total women\\'s purse in the new\\nyork city marathon was $134,500, organizers said, and a decade ago,\\nit was $165,000.\\n\\n\"if the sport was back in its amateur days, you definitely\\nwouldn\\'t see as many 30-plus marathoners than you do now,\" lamppa\\nsaid. \"i don\\'t think they\\'re staying in the sport purely for the\\nlove of it. it\\'s a nice gig if you can do it long enough. but, you\\nknow, it\\'s a painful gig, too.\"\\n\\nto make a decent living at marathon running in your 30s and 40s,\\nlamppa added, athletes must remain fast enough to finish in the top\\n10. that could be a challenge for an aging athlete.\\n\\nhirofumi tanaka, an exercise researcher at the university of\\ntexas, said endurance athletes had the edge over sprinters as time\\nmarched on. he said sprinters peaked at 22 to 24, and marathoners\\npeaked at 28 to 31. some marathoners reach peak performance around\\n35, he added. the trick is finding the way to extend that time\\nframe.\\n\\nhigh-level marathoners should be able to do so, said vonda\\nwright, a professor of orthopedics at the university of pittsburgh.\\nin a study published in march that looked at male and female\\namerican masters record-holders in distances from 100 to 10,000\\nmeters for the past 50 years, wright said she found less than a 1\\npercent decline per year in performance as they aged from 30 to 50.\\n\\nthe slow-twitch muscles needed in endurance sports do not\\ndecline significantly until athletes reach their late 30s or early\\n40s, she said. but fast-twitch muscles that sprinters rely on begin\\ndeteriorating in their late 20s and early 30s.\\n\\n\"if you are a runner in your 30s or 40s, it\\'s really a sweet\\nspot to be in,\" wright said. \"you\\'ve trained longer, so your\\nheart works more efficiently and your lungs exchange oxygen more\\nefficiently. you know your race, you know your body.\\n\\n\"biology might not have taken over yet, so you don\\'t see that\\nmuscle physiology decline that would prevent them from being\\namazing.\"\\n\\nthat decline, however, could happen any day -- and there is no\\ntelling when the athlete will notice it.\\n\\nwaitz, one of the best female marathoners, said from the time\\nshe was 35 until she retired at 38, she could sense her body\\nchanging.\\n\\n\"the end sneaked up on me,\" she said.\\n\\nafter 10 years and 20 marathons, waitz said, it took longer to\\nrecover from races. she became injured more easily. but she said\\nthe change in the mental aspect of the marathon, not the physical\\npart, prompted her retirement.\\n\\nwaitz said she did not feel as hungry to win as she once had,\\npartly because she sensed that her body was not as strong.\\n\\n\"i always say that there are two ages of a person: a running\\nage and your biological age,\" she said. \"so after all those\\nmarathons, i was old as a runner but still young as a person. i\\nstill felt fast, but i was not. it was time for me to go.\"\\n\\nndereba, a marathoner since 1999, said she had no idea when she\\nwould retire.\\n\\n\"now why would i quit if i can still finish in the top five?\"\\nndereba said. \"why would i quit when there are people out there,\\nso many people, who would want to run like catherine, but they\\ncan\\'t? i will run until i feel i can\\'t do it anymore.\"\\n\\nwith her massage therapist, she said, she still feels much\\nfaster and stronger than she did at 26, when she made her marathon\\ndebut in boston.\\n\\nndereba said she was in so much pain after finishing sixth in\\nthat race that she needed to be carted off in a wheelchair.\\n\\n\"so now, i don\\'t need a wheelchair when i finish,\" she said\\nwith a smile. \"it shows that i\\'m only getting better, right?\"\\n\\nnow that philadelphia has phulfilled its phantasies, it\\'s time\\nfor sports sympathizers to turn their bleeding hearts to other\\ncities: cleveland and atlanta, to name two.\\n\\nduring the world series, the story line was as much about\\nphiladelphia as it was about the phillies, who had not won it since\\n1980. the world was continually reminded that philly\\'s teams in\\nmajor league baseball, the nfl, the nba and the nhl had not won a\\nchampionship since the 76ers, with julius erving and moses malone,\\ntook the nba title in 1983.\\n\\npoor philly, no championships over that quarter-century, but\\nnobody in cleveland and atlanta was feeling sorry for all those\\nphilly phans.\\n\\nthe indians haven\\'t won the world series since 1948, when bob\\nfeller and bob lemon were in their rotation. the browns have never\\nbeen to the super bowl. the cavaliers haven\\'t won the nba title,\\nand in their only two nhl seasons three decades ago, the barons\\nfinished last in their division.\\n\\nfor all of the braves\\' 15 division titles in atlanta, they won\\nonly one world series, in 1995 (against the indians). the falcons\\nhaven\\'t won the super bowl, the hawks haven\\'t captured the nba\\nchampionship and the thrashers haven\\'t lifted the stanley cup.\\n\\nbefore the super bowl era, the browns won the 1964 nfl\\nchampionship and three titles in the 1950s, when paul brown was\\ntheir coach and otto graham their quarterback; they also swept all\\nfour all-america football conference titles. the indians won\\nanother world series, in 1920.\\n\\nin atlanta, the falcons at least reached the super bowl once but\\nlost. the braves got to the world series four other times, but lost\\nto minnesota once, toronto once and the yankees twice.\\n\\nonly five cities/regions have had title teams in each of the\\nfour major sports: new york, boston/new england, chicago, detroit\\nand, surprise, philadelphia.\\n\\nin addition to the success of the phillies and the 76ers, the\\neagles, with center-linebacker chuck bednarik often playing both\\nways, ruled the nfl in 1960 and also in 1948 and 1949. the flyers,\\nalias the broad street bullies, hoisted the stanley cup in 1974 and\\n1975. in the long ago, connie mack\\'s baseball athletics won five\\nworld series.\\n\\nsome cities haven\\'t celebrated much. san francisco, for example.\\nthe 49ers won five super bowls (four with joe montana at\\nquarterback, one with steve young), but the giants never won the\\nworld series. across the bay in oakland, the athletics won four\\nworld series, the raiders two super bowls, and the golden state\\nwarriors took the 1975 nba title.\\n\\nof the cities that have celebrated all four championships, new\\nyork has had the most success, especially in baseball: 26 world\\nseries titles for the yankees, two for the mets, five for the\\ngiants before they departed for san francisco and one for the\\nborough of brooklyn before walter o\\'malley absconded to los angeles\\nwith the dodgers.\\n\\nadd four trays of super bowl rings (three giants, one jets),\\nfour earlier nfl titles for the giants, two nba titles for the\\nknicks, and the rangers\\' four stanley cups, notably in 1994 after a\\n54-year drought. if you include the metropolitan area franchises,\\nthe islanders won consecutive cups from 1980 to 1983, and the\\ndevils won three.\\n\\nlong before the red sox\\' two recent world series victories, the\\npatriots\\' three super bowls under coach bill belichick and the\\nceltics\\' triumph in june, boston bragged about its record 15 nba\\nchampionships featuring bill russell, bob cousy and larry bird; as\\nwell as the bruins\\' five stanley cups, the latest in 1970 and 1972\\nwhen bobby orr dazzled.\\n\\nchicago keeps seeking sympathy for the cubs, who haven\\'t won the\\nworld series since 1908, and the blackhawks, who haven\\'t won the\\nstanley cup since 1961. but michael jordan and the bulls dunked six\\nnba titles in eight seasons during the \\'90s, the white sox won the\\nseries in 2005, and chicago\\'s pro football teams won 10 nfl titles\\nbefore the 1985 bears dominated the super bowl.\\n\\nthe red wings\\' four recent stanley cups have emphasized that\\ndetroit is hockeytown. the lions have never been to the super bowl,\\nbut they won three nfl titles in the \\'50s and another in 1935. the\\ntigers won four world series and the pistons took three nba titles,\\ntwo with the bad boys in and 1989 and 1990.\\n\\nin los angeles, the lakers, under pat riley and phil jackson,\\nwon nine nba titles, the dodgers five world series, and the rams,\\nalthough no longer there, were the 1951 nfl champions, but its only\\nsuper bowl winners, the 1983 raiders, were on lend-lease from\\noakland. the hockey kings, even with wayne gretzky, lost in their\\nonly stanley cup finals.\\n\\nso if you cried a river for philadelphia, either the delaware or\\nthe schuylkill, you now may want to empty the cuyahoga in cleveland\\nor the chattahoochee in atlanta.\\n\\nleave it to jon stewart to cut to the chase.\\ninterviewing sen. barack obama last week as the campaign rolled\\ntoward its conclusion, the host of \"the daily show\" observed that\\nbeing president today looks considerably less appealing than when\\nobama launched his candidacy two years ago.\\n\\n\"is there a sense that you don\\'t want this?\" stewart asked.\\n\"that you may look at the country and think, \\'you know, when i\\nthought i was going to get this, it was a relatively new car. now\\nlook at it!\"\\'\\n\\nobama laughed and gave an earnest answer about having an impact,\\nbut did not really address the larger question. just why would\\nanyone want this job, anyway? what is it about the psyche of\\nwould-be presidents that makes them wake up in the morning and\\nthink it would be gratifying to take on the troubles of the world,\\nto assume responsibility for the lives of 300 million americans at\\na time when their lives are so precarious?\\n\\nand particularly now, in this moment of maximum crisis. millions\\nare in danger of losing their homes. hundreds of thousands have\\nlost their jobs. the national debt is skyrocketing. the taliban is\\nrampaging through afghanistan. pakistan is a nuclear-armed\\nshambles. the country is still at war in iraq and trying to avoid\\nit with iran and north korea. russia has invaded a neighbor. and\\nmuch of the world hates us.\\n\\n\"this is an unprecedented mess,\" said ted sorensen, the former\\ncounselor to president john f. kennedy. by many measures, no\\nincoming president will have inherited quite such a sack of trouble\\nin decades. yet neither obama nor sen. john mccain has expressed\\nsecond thoughts.\\n\\n\"you have to not only have a sense of confidence but a pretty\\nbig ego -- you have to almost be a fanatic,\" sorensen said. \"you\\nhave to look at yourself and everybody else running for the office\\nand think not only are you as good as they are, but you and your\\nideas are better.\"\\n\\nand that you can fix what nobody else can fix. the ambition and\\ndrive that propel politicians to high office at a time of\\ntribulations may convince them that the country\\'s deep problems are\\nsimply successes waiting to happen.\\n\\n\"part of self-confidence is believing you have special gifts\\nand how selfish of you not to use them to full capacity,\" said\\nalvin s. felzenberg, a university of pennsylvania scholar and\\nauthor of \"the leaders we deserved (and a few we didn\\'t).\" \"it\\'s\\nnot a job for ordinary mortals. it may have been fairer in the\\nmiddle ages to have them walk over hot coals than what we put them\\nthrough now.\"\\n\\nof course, this is not yet the hot-coals part of the program.\\nfor two more days, obama and mccain can still enjoy the affirmation\\nof the crowds. to see either on the campaign trail last week\\nsurrounded by fans proclaiming everlasting love was to taste the\\nelixir of adulation that attracts politicians to the presidency\\neven now.\\n\\n\"that\\'s a pretty heavy trip,\" said jerrold m. post, a\\nprofessor of political psychology at george washington university.\\n\"the nature of the relationship between leaders and the people\\naround them is very important. it\\'s a very heady experience, and\\nsomething happens when you become president.\"\\n\\nyet even in the best of times, the presidency can be an enormous\\nburden. every american soldier killed abroad, every house\\nforeclosed on at home, every monster storm from the gulf of mexico\\nto the indian ocean ultimately becomes his responsibility.\\n\\nincreasingly, that burden has come to define the job as much as\\nthe glamour. parents get that. a cnn/opinion research corp. poll in\\n2006 found that only 41 percent of mothers and fathers would want\\ntheir child to grow up to be president, compared with 58 percent\\nwho would not. and that was before things got as crazy as they are\\nnow.\\n\\nthink about those before-and-after pictures of presidents\\nleaving office. let\\'s look back at how the vast majority in the\\nmodern era have left the white house. president kennedy was\\nassassinated. lyndon b. johnson and richard m. nixon were driven\\nfrom power. gerald r. ford, jimmy carter and george h.w. bush were\\nrepudiated by the voters. bill clinton departed after his most\\nintimate personal failings were excavated for public examination.\\ngeorge w. bush is leaving as the most unpopular commander in chief\\nin the history of polling.\\n\\nperhaps the only president lately who left office reasonably\\nintact was ronald reagan, who recovered from the iran-contra\\nscandal and found himself revered as time passed.\\n\\n\"the thing about reagan is, he was not stuck on himself,\" said\\ndavid m. abshire, a special counselor to reagan and now the\\npresident of the center for the study of the presidency. \"he was\\nnot an ideologue. and his sense of humor was always on himself. in\\ndealing with him, i was never dealing with a big ego.\"\\n\\nthose who think the office does not wear down presidents do not\\nsee them with their guard down. critics consider president bush\\nimmune to the devastation of the war he launched, but he has met\\nprivately with hundreds of relatives of slain soldiers, many of\\nwhom later described him weeping and genuinely anguished by their\\npain.\\n\\nfor all that, bush still has that gene that makes presidents\\nwant to be president even in dark moments. he told aides and\\nbusinesspeople this fall that if the financial crisis was going to\\nhappen, he was glad it happened on his watch so he could put the\\ncountry on a path to improvement by the time his successor takes\\noffice.\\n\\nin some ways, obama has expressed similar sentiments. his\\nadvisers said they warn him every day that he may be winning a pile\\nof manure if he beats mccain on tuesday. but they also hope that\\nthings are so bad, they can only get better.\\n\\nobama\\'s answer to stewart suggested that he sees an opportunity\\nfor an ambitious program, that when people are struggling for\\nanswers they are less resistant to change.\\n\\n\"i actually think this is the time to want to be president,\"\\nhe said. \"you know, if you went into public service thinking that\\nyou could have an impact, now is the time where you can have an\\nimpact.\"\\n\\nultimately, felzenberg said, the motivation may come down to\\nposterity. every president sees himself on mount rushmore. \"maybe\\nyou have enough gumption to think you can defy the gods and come\\nout intact,\" he said. \"i guess you have an opportunity for\\nimmortality. people like me still talk about lincoln and jefferson\\nas if they were still living now, and in a way they are. every time\\nwe talk about them, we bring them back to life.\"\\n\\nin a sign that high-end collectibles may withstand the economic\\ndownturn, a near-record price for a rare postage stamp was set last\\nweek at an auction in new york city.\\n\\na pink 3-cent stamp issued in 1868 and depicting george\\nwashington was bought on wednesday by an anonymous bidder for\\n$1,035,000, including commission. stamps of this design are common\\nand usually worth only a few dollars; but what made this one worth\\na million dollars is a distinct, waffle-like grill pressed into the\\nback of the stamp as part of a short-lived government experiment to\\nprevent fraudulent re-use. the post office tried out various sizes\\nof grills, and only four 3-cent stamps with this type, called a\\nb-grill by collectors, are known to exist.\\n\\nthe four were rediscovered in 1969, on a single envelope from a\\nletter mailed to germany. the stamp is one of the keys to\\nassembling a complete collection of american stamps.\\n\\nthis particular example last sold at auction in 1993 for\\n$85,000; another of the four sold in 1998 for $155,000. wednesday\\'s\\nbuyer, who bid by telephone, was described by the auctioneer only\\nas a \"longtime, serious collector\" who is most likely trying to\\ncomplete a collection.\\n\\nlast week, 15 of the 88 university of north texas football\\nplayers failed a test for recreational or so-called street drugs.\\nthe unusual part of this story is that the second-year coach todd\\ndodge chose to have his entire active roster tested, even though\\nthe sun belt conference and ncaa do not require this kind of\\ntesting.\\n\\nother coaches around the country have done some targeted\\ntesting, but a wholesale maneuver like this is rarely done and\\nalmost never surfaces as it has at the university in denton.\\n\\nnorth texas, 0-8 entering saturday\\'s game at western kentucky,\\nis off to its worst start ever, and dodge said he saw the\\ninconsistent performances, lack of focus and mood swings of his\\nplayers as indications that his team might have a problem.\\n\\n\"twenty-three years of coaching had given me pretty good\\nintuition about consistency and inconsistency,\" dodge said in a\\ntelephone interview. \"i suspected that there may be some uses of\\nmarijuana on our team; i felt that we may have one or two that have\\nreally got a problem and they\\'re crying out for help, and we may\\nhave another dozen or so that are just starting to dibble-dabble in\\nthe stuff.\"\\n\\ndodge said he also felt that the specter of testing could give\\nhis players \"a reason to say no at the next party they go to.\"\\nthe 15 who tested positive will continue to play and do not face\\nany suspensions. they will be randomly tested throughout the\\nacademic year and are required to attend substance-abuse\\ncounseling. testing all 88 players cost the university roughly\\n$2,800.\\n\\nbrett vito, a reporter for the denton record-chronicle, broke\\nthe story, which is based on university records obtained through\\nthe freedom of information act. according to the article, the\\ntesting was done between sept. 24 and oct. 15.\\n\\nmost division i and ii athletic programs do some testing for\\nrecreational drugs. but such testing is usually done on a small\\nsampling of the program\\'s athletes.\\n\\ndodge said it was only fair that he tested the entire team. \"i\\ndidn\\'t want them saying i was picking on this certain group or that\\ncertain group or you\\'re only testing guys you didn\\'t recruit,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe team captain, casey fitzgerald, a senior wide receiver, said\\nhis coach called the right play. \"i feel it was a big step for\\ndodge,\" he said by phone thursday. \"he has that responsibility;\\nit\\'s good to know he was looking out for people and making sure, if\\nthere was a problem, it would be addressed.\" fitzgerald led the\\nnation in receptions per game with 10.4 entering saturday\\'s games.\\n\\n\"there was a team meeting, we addressed the problem and the\\npublicity that we received,\" he said. \"we just reassured each\\nother that we\\'re all in it together. we\\'re going to put this behind\\nus and try to make everything good.\"\\n\\nthere have been cynical reactions to the decision to test his\\nplayers: would dodge have done this if the team were 8-0? was he\\ntrying to imply that drug use -- not coaching -- was the reason the\\nteam was underperforming?\\n\\n\"my charge while i\\'m here as the head football coach is to help\\nthis football program and this football team reach its potential,\"\\ndodge said. \"we\\'re not close to doing that right now. and if we\\'ve\\ngot a bunch of \\'em that are smoking dope, there\\'s no way we can get\\nthere.\"\\n\\ndodge did the right thing, and so did the university in\\nsupporting him. even if there is a double standard in that most\\nstudents can use street drugs without fear of being tested by their\\nuniversity.\\n\\n\"it is very different for athletes,\" said the university\\npresident, gretchen m. bataille. \"athletes have scholarships and\\nthey sign consent forms. they\\'re basically recipients of $100,000\\nworth of scholarships over a four-year period. with that comes\\ncertain responsibilities.\\n\\n\"the consent form says they can say that they don\\'t want to be\\ntested, but then they\\'re off the team.\"\\n\\nthe high rate of use among north texas football players makes it\\nclear that a broader drug-testing net needs to be cast.\\n\\nthe ncaa has a year-round random testing program for all\\ndivisions i and ii athletes for steroids, masking agents and\\namphetamines, according to mary e. wilfert, the associate director\\nof educational services. the ncaa tests for all drugs -- performance\\nenhancing and recreational -- only during ncaa championships.\\n\\ndrug testers for the ncaa just happened to be on campus --\\nrandomly testing 20 football players for performance-enhancing\\ndrugs -- right when dodge\\'s team was being tested for mood-altering\\ndrugs like marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine.\\n\\nthe ncaa does not mandate that its member institutions or\\nconferences test for drugs that are not considered\\nperformance-enhancing. this is a mistake.\\n\\nas dodge told his players: \"it\\'s not good for us, it\\'s illegal,\\nit leads to worse things, it leads to incarceration and sometimes\\nit leads to death. how could that be good for our team?\"\\n\\nthe difference between the high-profile sports teams on campus\\nand almost any other extracurricular activity is the public nature\\nof success and failure, wins and losses -- and how much money and\\nacclaim they bring to the university.\\n\\nthe frustration of losing may have contributed to the role of\\ndrug use at north texas.\\n\\n\"sometimes, that triggers that,\" waters said of the\\ncorrelation between losing and recreational drug use.\\n\\n\"and you\\'ve got to be prepared, whether it\\'s your academic\\ncounseling center or whether it\\'s your trainers or whether it\\'s\\nyour assistant coaches, you\\'ve really got to spend some additional\\ntime helping these kids deal with the frustration. winning is a\\nwonderful thing, losing is a terrible thing.\"\\n\\nfitzgerald said the frustration of losing should have nothing to\\ndo with choices that are made away from football. \"it all just\\nboils down to who you are,\" fitzgerald said. \"you can do anything\\nyou want every day. it\\'s about being smart and making the right\\ndecisions.\"\\n\\nnorth texas is having a miserable season on the field, but\\ndodge\\'s bold move to hold his players accountable may turn out in\\nthe long run to be his program\\'s best game plan.\\n\\nthere\\'s nothing like game day, and after the\\nadventure of oxford basketball tryouts i couldn\\'t wait to play in a\\nreal game. that sense of anticipation was only heightened by the\\ntrip to nottingham for our season opener.\\n\\nlet me say this: the trip made me miss the good ol\\' days when i\\nwent to games by bus. all 11 of us piled into two european cars.\\nthe pregame meal was on the road and consisted of a variety of\\nhomemade sandwiches. dan altschuler was just finishing his\\nnutella-and-peanut-butter special when duncan england, one of the\\nlocal students on the team, said, \"look, it\\'s sherwood forest.\"\\nthe americans in the car went crazy. in the back of my mind, i was\\nthinking, if we\\'re passing sherwood forest on the way to the game,\\nwhat\\'s waiting for us at the gym?\\n\\nthere was no way the game could live up to the hype. there was\\nno royalty in the crowd -- or even any crowd at all. and no men in\\ntights tried to redistribute points from the team that was winning\\nto the team that was losing, although the girl working the\\nscoreboard tried once or twice.\\n\\nafter the jump ball, the game was surprisingly familiar -- made\\neven more so by the presence of our point guard, jeff miller. jeff\\nplayed junior varsity for princeton. he\\'s everything i came to\\nexpect from a princeton basketball player over four years in the\\nivy league.\\n\\njeff is a rhodes scholar who has the need to stop practice every\\ntime anyone makes a backdoor cut to explain the proper angle. toss\\nin a couple of princeton oddities, like his insistence to shoot\\nlayups from the right side with his left hand and vice versa, and\\nyou have the prototypical princeton guard.\\n\\ni never miss the chance to give jeff a hard time about his\\nbackground, so when jeff closed out the game with a wrong-foot,\\nwrong-hand, wild drive that drew a foul, i didn\\'t greet him with\\n\"cheers.\" instead, he heard, \"that\\'s so princeton.\" his free\\nthrows put the finishing touches on our 94-53 win.\\n\\nthe game might have been \"so princeton,\" but the postgame was\\nall oxford. our first tradition is to do a cheer, for the other\\nteam. against nottingham, it was a simple \"1-2-3 nottingham!\" but\\ncoach brian porth was so happy to get his first win that i almost\\npersuaded him to let us chant, \"two, four, six, eight, who do we\\nappreciate? nottingham! nottingham. go nottingham!\"\\n\\nthe postgame cheers were nothing compared with the postgame\\ncelebration. the festivities took place at st. vincent\\'s. vinnie\\'s\\nis pure oxford. it has a dress code and pictures of old students\\nall over the walls. bill bradley\\'s picture is front and center by\\nthe bar, and everyone brags that he is a better athlete than bill\\nclinton, who played only on the \"twos\" basketball during his\\nrhodes stint.\\n\\nst. vincent\\'s is old school. at lunchtime, it is an all-male\\neating club, and the process of becoming a member is shrouded in\\nmystery. you have to be invited to join, but asking how you receive\\nan invitation is a disqualifier.\\n\\non wednesday nights, vinnie\\'s becomes the postmatch gathering\\nplace; all oxford sports play on wednesdays. teams gather there for\\nthe drinks. the bar serves the appropriate winter ales and mixed\\ndrinks, but has specials called pinkies and perkies. a pinky is\\ngrapefruit juice, orange juice and five shots of gin. a perky is\\ngrapefruit juice, lemonade and five shots of vodka.\\n\\ni can attest firsthand that perkies have the power to turn a\\ncouple of postgame drinks into an ill-advised wednesday night at\\nthe euro club scene. the only problem? the morning after the\\nnottingham game, i had a meeting with my master\\'s supervisor at\\n8:30. but under the influence of a few perkies and buoyed by the\\ngood cheer of my teammates, that didn\\'t seem like such an\\nimpediment. my education about english basketball continued until\\nclose to 4 in the morning.\\n\\ni may be only one game in, but i have learned this much about\\noxford basketball: it\\'s the postgame traditions that count.\\nbackdoor cuts and layups off the wrong feet may be \"so\\nprinceton,\" but too many perkies and two hours of sleep before\\nmeeting with my academic adviser, \"that\\'s so oxford.\"\\n\\ndenver -- democrat barack obama has solidified his base and\\npicked up a majority of unaffiliated voters in colorado, giving him\\na five percentage point lead over republican john mccain, according\\nto a new denver post poll.\\n\\nwith only 72 hours remaining in the presidential campaign, the\\nresults -- in addition to other statewide polls showing mccain\\ntrailing obama -- indicates that the arizona senator faces\\nsubstantial challenges in winning colorado.\\n\\noverall, obama leads mccain 49 percent to 44 percent. colorado\\nunaffiliated voters, the critical voting bloc making up more than\\none-third of the electorate, are backing obama 57 percent to 32\\npercent. four percent of those polled, however, are still\\nundecided.\\n\\nin a denver post poll one month ago, the two candidates were\\ntied, with 8 percent of voters undecided. since then, obama has\\nincreased his lead over mccain among men, women, independents and\\nvoters over 35 years old.\\n\\nbrad coker, pollster for mason-dixon polling &amp;amp; research who\\nconducted the poll for the post, said the number of undecideds in\\ncolorado is smaller than in other battleground states. while those\\nvoters could have an impact, especially if they all throw their\\nweight behind mccain, obama has momentum.\\n\\n\"obama looks like he\\'s in good shape. even if all the\\nundecided\\'s break to mccain, obama could likely still hang on,\"\\ncoker said.\\n\\nmccain spokesman tom kise said in the final few days of a\\ncampaign polls are \"all over the board.\"\\n\\n\"the only poll that is going to matter is the one on election\\nday,\" he said. \"in these last 96 hours ... we are fully confident\\nthat we will turn our people out and colorado will be a red state\\non election day.\"\\n\\nin the past 44 years, the state has voted for a democratic\\npresidential candidate only once: bill clinton in 1992. so even\\nwith a lead, the obama campaign is not taking the state for\\ngranted. the illinois senator attended a campaign rally in pueblo\\non saturday.\\n\\nobama campaign manager david plouffe said he thinks independent\\nvoters in colorado will continue to \"break decisively\" for obama.\\n\\nin colorado and nationally, plouffe disputed the notion that\\nundecided voters will trend en masse to mccain.\\n\\n\"we reject that 90 percent of the undecideds will go for\\nmccain,\" plouffe said in a conference call friday. \"some states\\nwill split evenly, some will break a little more to him, some more\\nto us.\"\\n\\ncolorado voters, as those in the rest of the nation,\\noverwhelmingly cited the economy as the most important national\\nissue facing the country, and obama narrowly edges out mccain on\\nthe question of who is best able to handle economic issues.\\n\\nhe also is ahead of mccain on environmental and public-land\\nissues, developing energy resources and improving health care.\\nmccain leads on immigration, national security, cutting taxes and\\nmanaging the war in iraq.\\n\\nindependent voters have also sided strongly with the campaign of\\ndemocratic senate candidate mark udall, giving him a small but\\nstable lead in the race for colorado\\'s open senate seat, the poll\\nfound.\\n\\nthe poll indicates that both candidates are getting overwhelming\\nsupport from their own party voters, with udall enjoying a 19-point\\nlead among independents.\\n\\noverall, udall leads republican bob schaffer by 47 percent to 43\\npercent, a small drop from the five-point lead he enjoyed in a\\ndenver post poll a month ago and one that shows a significantly\\nsmaller lead for udall than other recent polls.\\n\\nfourteen percent remain undecided in the senate contest.\\n\\nthe poll of 625 likely voters was conducted on tuesday and\\nwednesday. an additional 200 unaffiliated voters were also\\ninterviewed and are reflected in the poll, which has a margin of\\nerror of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\\n\\nmany homeowners who have taken out home equity lines of credit\\nhave learned in recent months that these loans are not as useful as\\nthey initially seemed.\\n\\nlenders are struggling to minimize risk, and because they are\\nespecially at risk to lose money on residential real estate loans,\\nthey are cutting back on homeowners\\' credit lines or freezing them\\naltogether.\\n\\nmany people who took out home equity credit lines of $100,000 on\\ntheir home and used only, say, $20,000 have received letters\\ninforming them they can no longer borrow additional money, just as\\ntheir stock portfolios are dwindling. the banks\\' reasoning,\\ntypically, is that area property values are dropping, so the equity\\ndoes not actually exist.\\n\\nto challenge the bank\\'s valuation of a home, a homeowner has\\nlittle recourse but to spend his or her own money to order an\\nappraisal -- a potentially costly and futile approach.\\n\\nbut a new countermeasure is emerging: take out the money before\\nthe bank puts it out of reach. in this strategy, borrowers draw the\\nmaximum amount even if they don\\'t need it, then place the cash in a\\nliquid, and safe, investment vehicle.\\n\\n\"i categorize this as liquidity protection,\" said oded\\nben-ami, a senior loan officer with the sterling national mortgage\\ncompany, based in great neck, n.y.\\n\\nben-ami said he had suggested to mortgage clients that they\\nconsider drawing down the maximum amount possible from their home\\nequity credit lines.\\n\\nwhich leads to a question: where to put the money?\\n\\nhome equity credit lines usually carry interest rates equal to\\nor slightly lower than the prime lending rate, which banks charge\\ntheir best customers. last week, that rate fell to 4 percent as the\\ngovernment looked to stimulate the economy.\\n\\nthose who withdraw their home equity should consider putting the\\ncash into a certificate of deposit, a savings account or a\\nmoney-market account, ben-ami said.\\n\\nthese financial instruments are typically insured by the federal\\ndeposit insurance corporation. borrowers can withdraw the money on\\nshort notice and pay no penalties in the case of savings or money\\nmarket accounts, or marginal penalties for early withdrawals from\\ncds. (unlike money market accounts, money market funds are not\\nprotected if the depository fails.)\\n\\nshort-term liquidity is a key advantage, as borrowers may well\\nbe using their credit lines for college tuition bills or as\\nemergency funds if they lose a job or face a major home repair.\\n\\ninterest rates paid by cds were at least 3 percent last month,\\nben-ami said. \"so on an equity line of $100,000, the annual cost\\nof this strategy is approximately $1,000\" -- the difference between\\na cost of 4 percent and income of 3 percent, he said.\\n\\n\"the question then is, is it worth it to you to pay $1,000 a\\nyear to ensure $100,000 worth of liquidity against the worst of\\ncircumstances? for many people, the answer is yes.\"\\n\\nthere are some risks for borrowers who follow this approach.\\nfirst, if the value of a home drops significantly and the borrowers\\nhave spent the cash from their equity line, they can end up owing\\nmore money than their property is worth. (in industry parlance, the\\nborrower is then \"under water\" or \"upside down.\")\\n\\nthe prospect of easy money is also a temptation that some\\nborrowers will find difficult to resist. but for those with enough\\nself-restraint not to spend more than they need, withdrawing the\\nfull credit line may be easier than having a credit line rescinded\\nand then finding another bank.\\n\\nc.c. sabathia is probably going to be a rich pitcher with a west\\ncoast team or an even wealthier pitcher with the yankees. first\\nbaseman mark teixeira could be added to the mix in the american\\nleague east, where the orioles, the yankees and the red sox covet\\nhim, or he could remain with the angels. outfielder manny ramirez\\nmay keep hanging out in mannywood by staying with the dodgers.\\n\\nfour days ago, one season ended when brad lidge fell to his\\nknees after guiding the phillies to their first world series\\nchampionship since 1980. another season, farcically called the\\noff-season, will begin monday with the general managers meetings in\\ndana point, calif.\\n\\nalthough free agents cannot sign with new teams until nov. 14,\\nthere has been endless ruminating about where sabathia, teixeira\\nand ramirez will end up. trade discussions will also intensify\\nbecause pitcher jake peavy of the san diego padres and outfielder\\nmatt holliday of the colorado rockies are among those who could be\\ndealt.\\n\\nalthough sabathia, teixeira and ramirez will receive the most\\nattention from the news media because of their status, other free\\nagents can have an impact. these players may not be as dominant as\\nsabathia, as polished as teixeira or as fearsome as ramirez, but\\nthey range from talented to useful to fading.\\n\\nhere are a dozen intriguing free agents not named c.c., manny or\\ntexas.\\n\\norlando hudson, 2b\\n\\nhe is a three-time gold glove winner and a strong influence in\\nthe clubhouse. hudson has been injury-prone, but that should not\\nscare teams. if the mets ate most of the $18 million left on luis\\ncastillo\\'s contract and traded him, they could sign hudson. still,\\ngeneral manager omar minaya said, \"right now, i think castillo is\\ngoing to be our second baseman.\"\\n\\nderek lowe, p\\n\\nthe durable lowe is an appealing option for teams that do not\\nsign sabathia. lowe has averaged 15 victories and 208 innings in\\nthe last seven seasons and has a 3.33 earned run average in the\\npostseason. if the huge offer the yankees will undoubtedly make\\ndoes not sway sabathia, they should take a long look at lowe.\\n\\nmilton bradley, dh/of\\n\\nthe good news is he hit .321 with 22 homers and 77 runs batted\\nin this year. the bad news is he hit 68 points higher at rangers\\nballpark in arlington than on the road, he has averaged just 90\\ngames a season for the last four years and he is always a threat to\\nimplode.\\n\\na.j. burnett, p\\n\\nhe is expected to opt out of his deal with the blue jays and\\npursue another loaded contract. when burnett is healthy, scouts\\nrave about his repertory. he was healthy enough this year to win 18\\ngames, strike out 231 and toss 221 1/3 innings, all career highs. a\\nteam will give burnett big money and pray that he holds up.\\n\\njuan cruz, p\\n\\nhow much could the mets have used cruz, a thin-as-a-foul-pole\\nright-hander, when they were playing dial-a-reliever in september?\\ncruz has a 94-mile-per-hour fastball and struck out 71 in 51 2/3\\ninnings. he is not a closer but would be a stellar addition to help\\nrevamp any bullpen.\\n\\njason giambi, dh/1b\\n\\nhe had seven adventurous years with the yankees. now it could be\\ntime to return to oakland, a soft landing spot for giambi. he\\nshould be able to crank out at least one more season of 30 homers\\nand a .375 on-base percentage.\\n\\nraul ibanez, of\\n\\nhe has knocked in 338 runs over the last three seasons while\\nbeing hidden in seattle. a low-maintenance, high-production player,\\nibanez could improve a lot of lineups and gain some acclaim, too.\\nthe rays, the cubs and the mets could use a power-hitting\\noutfielder.\\n\\njason varitek, c\\n\\nbefore 2008, he probably figured he might match jorge posada\\'s\\n$54-million contract. not anymore. while scott boras, varitek\\'s\\nagent, offers him to the tigers and others, varitek should probably\\nbe content with a two-year contract at a reduced salary from the\\nred sox.\\n\\npedro martinez, p\\n\\nhe will pitch somewhere, most likely not with the mets. martinez\\nwould be smart to stay in the national league, where his 87-mph\\nfastball will not be so wimpy. minaya said the mets would talk to\\nmartinez, which sounded like a polite goodbye to a pitcher with a\\n5.61 era.\\n\\nbobby abreu, of\\n\\nhe has driven in 100 runs or more for six straight years, is a\\npatient hitter and has decent speed. the yankees like him, but he\\nwill be 35 in march and his statistics are slowly declining, so\\nthey will not offer him a three-year deal. but some team will.\\n\\njoe beimel, p\\n\\na left-handed relief specialist, he has allowed one homer in his\\nlast 128 innings. barry bonds could never solve beimel. why should\\nanyone else? beimel will not command a pricey deal, which makes him\\neven more attractive.\\n\\nben sheets, p\\n\\nhe missed the postseason with an elbow injury and has averaged\\nabout 150 innings for the last four years. that is not the\\nprescription for a reliable no. 1 starter. buyer, beware.\\n\\nat this important time, every buyer should beware. the\\noff-season is about to begin. the serious spending will soon\\nfollow.\\n\\njimmie johnson has been so dominant lately that he could wrap up\\nhis third straight title in two more races, or as early as next\\nsunday. unfortunately for curtis gray, there are three races left\\nin the nascar sprint cup season.\\n\\ngray is the president of homestead-miami speedway, which will\\nhost the season finale on nov. 16. no other track has benefited\\nfrom the chase for the sprint cup more than homestead, where the\\nchampion has been determined the past four years.\\n\\nbut johnson has stormed to a 183-point lead over carl edwards\\nheading into sunday\\'s race in fort worth. if johnson leads by at\\nleast 161 points after the nov. 9 race in phoenix, he will win the\\ntitle, no matter how he does at homestead.\\n\\ngray said friday that he thought that homestead would sell out\\nthe race, although he added that he had the same trouble selling\\ntickets that track officials elsewhere had encountered because of\\nthe economic downturn. the attendance at atlanta last sunday\\ndropped to 80,000 from 100,000, though that could also be a sign of\\ndiminishing fan interest.\"it\\'s not the best scenario for us,\" he\\nsaid. \"obviously, we\\'d like to have a close and exciting chase\\nlike we\\'ve had for the last few years.\"\\n\\nthere are still two races to go before the finale -- 646 laps, or\\n813 miles -- so there is time for johnson to run into mechanical\\ntrouble or a fender-bender.\\n\\n\"why not?\" gray said, laughing, before quickly adding, \"i\\'m\\njust kidding.\"\\n\\nkurt busch beat johnson by just eight points for the first chase\\ntitle in 2004. four drivers had a chance to win the title going\\ninto homestead in 2005; five drivers were in contention heading\\ninto the final race in 2006.\\n\\nlast year, johnson went into homestead with a four-race winning\\nstreak but a surmountable 86-point lead over jeff gordon. when\\ngordon finished fourth, johnson\\'s seventh-place finish was good\\nenough for him to clinch the title by 77 points.\\n\\n\"it\\'s been real good for us, but what we\\'re building is an\\nevent much like the super bowl, where it doesn\\'t matter what\\ndrivers are in the championship race when they get here,\" gray\\nsaid of the chase. \"at this point in the history of the super\\nbowl, it doesn\\'t matter who\\'s in the game.\"\\n\\nto maintain fan interest, nascar has been promoting other\\ncompetitions that are still in play, like the nationwide series,\\nthe rung below the sprint cup, and the manufacturer\\'s championship,\\nwhich is currently led by chevrolet.\\n\\nbut johnson has been so fast in the chase with five top-five\\nfinishes in seven races that it appears as if he will cruise to his\\nthird straight title. only one driver has won three straight titles\\nin nascar\\'s highest division: cale yarborough in 1976-78.\\n\\njohnson\\'s bid to match yarborough could be helped by the\\nlocations of his next two races: texas motor speedway and phoenix\\ninternational raceway. johnson has finished first and second in his\\nlast two races at texas, and has won his last two races at phoenix.\\n\\njohnson\\'s most impressive performance was last sunday at\\natlanta, when he took four fresh tires and zoomed to 2nd place from\\n11th in the last eight laps of the race. edwards won the race.\\n\\n\"jimmie\\'s the last guy i want to see in my mirror with a few\\nlaps to go,\" edwards said during a conference call last week.\\n\\ngiven johnson\\'s dominance, other drivers have been asked if the\\npoints system should be tweaked -- again -- to ensure that all 36\\nraces of the season are meaningful, something the chase was\\nsupposed to have addressed.\\n\\n\"i think you could throw at them whatever you want, and they\\'re\\nstill going to figure out how to win it,\" matt kenseth said,\\nreferring to johnson and his crew chief, chad knaus. \"there\\'s\\nnothing wrong with that.\"\\n\\nthis year\\'s race at homestead could merely be a coronation for\\njohnson, but gray said that might not be such a bad thing because\\njohnson was poised to accomplish something that no driver had done\\nin 30 years.\\n\\n\"but first, he\\'s got to get through two more races,\" gray\\nsaid. \"he\\'s got a long way to go.\"\\n\\nit happened again last sunday.\\n\\nan apparent mistake by officials -- this time it was a muffed\\npunt by the atlanta falcons that did not look muffed after all --\\nprobably changed the course of a game. from there, what has become\\na familiar postgame ritual unspooled: the play broadcast repeatedly\\nin slow motion all over the country, arch commentary about the\\nofficials\\' competence, the inevitable note from the falcons sent to\\nnfl headquarters asking for an explanation.\\n\\nmike pereira, the league\\'s director of officiating, always has a\\nfull in-box from irate coaches, owners and fans. but one\\nspectacularly blown call by ed hochuli, the nfl\\'s highest-profile\\nofficial, has opened the floodgates to an unusual level of scrutiny\\nand scorn from coaches and players in the first half of the season.\\nand with each excruciatingly detailed replay or game-turning\\ndecision (there have been at least three obvious ones so far), the\\nangry chorus has grown louder, creating a problem for the nfl the\\nstatistics show that officiating is no worse this year than before,\\nbut the perception that there are more bad calls resonates.\\n\\naccording to the nfl\\'s grading, for every 100 plays, 97.64 of\\nthem were officiated correctly before sunday\\'s games. because games\\nhistorically average a little more than 150 plays, officials are\\naveraging about four mistakes a game, about the same as in 2007,\\nwhen the accuracy rate was 97.78. and pereira said that in a recent\\ngame (he would not say which one), a crew graded perfectly -- 100\\npercent correct on every call and noncall.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve never seen a game that didn\\'t have incomplete passes or\\nfumbles or interceptions,\" pereira said. \"once officiating gets\\nin the public eye, then it\\'s going to be there for a while. no\\nmatter if it\\'s better than in the past or worse. officiating is a\\nmental exercise that involves judgment that is difficult. it is\\nimperfect.\"\\n\\nthe former baltimore coach brian billick, who is now an analyst\\nfor fox, said criticism had ratcheted up in part because a blown\\ncall leading to a loss could result in a coach\\'s firing. marcellus\\nwiley, a former player who now works for espn, said he suspected\\nthat players had become more outspoken as they had received more\\nguaranteed money. but billick compared the officiating\\ncontroversies to fretting over injuries when a star quarterback is\\nhurt: are there really more, or does it just feel that way?\\n\\n\"one time, there was a hue and cry -- \\'this is the worst year\\nfor officiating\\' -- and we went back and looked and we determined it\\nhad been written five different years,\" said rich mckay, the\\nfalcons\\' president and a member of the nfl\\'s competition committee,\\nwhich oversees rule changes. \"since we brought instant replay\\nback, it\\'s not necessarily a good thing for officiating. you begin\\nto scrutinize plays at milliseconds. it creates an unreasonable and\\nunreal standard that you can\\'t meet.\"\\n\\nstill, hochuli\\'s call in the second week of the season -- he\\nruled that denver\\'s jay cutler had thrown an incomplete pass and\\nwhistled the play dead, negating what was clearly a fumble, not an\\nincompletion -- almost certainly cost san diego a victory. and it\\ngave birth to nonstop officiating surveillance.\\n\\nwhen hochuli\\'s crew waved off a carolina interception return for\\na touchdown with a roughing-the-passer penalty on julius peppers,\\nthere was instant analysis of the call\\'s accuracy. (peppers was\\nfined $10,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit on that play.) then, miami\\nlinebacker joey porter, angered by what he perceived as bad calls\\nby hochuli\\'s crew, said, \"i\\'m like, man, it\\'s crazy that the same\\nreferee staff from all of this other stuff that\\'s been happening\\nwas out there.\"\\n\\nporter, like other players and coaches who have sounded off, was\\nfined, an indication of the nfl\\'s distaste for questioning the\\nintegrity of the officials -- and for keeping such questions in the\\npublic eye.\\n\\n\"public criticism of officials is prohibited because it serves\\nthe club and the league no good,\" said ray anderson, the league\\'s\\nexecutive vice president for football operations.\\n\\n\"we do it privately, so we can make sure we\\'re responding to an\\nallegation that is presented in a calm moment, not in the heat of\\nbattle where you have just lost a game.\"\\n\\nbut as the scrutiny rippled far beyond hochuli, kc joyner, who\\nbreaks down game tape for his annual scientific football guides and\\nhis web site, the football scientist, said he wondered if the harsh\\nglare of the spotlight could be affecting officials.\\n\\nin a game between minnesota and detroit, a lions defender was\\ncalled for pass interference although replays indicated that the\\nreceiver was, at most, barely touched and that a flag should not\\nhave been thrown. the 42-yard penalty put the vikings in field-goal\\nposition, and they won the game.\\n\\nwhen officials took at least five minutes to sort out an unusual\\ncall in the arizona-dallas game a few weeks ago -- it put dallas in\\nposition to kick a tying field goal -- joyner became convinced that\\nofficials were hesitant to make mistakes, a possibility\\nacknowledged by the retired official jim tunney.\\n\\n\"it can make them gun-shy, and it\\'s very important to work with\\nthe crew in terms of confidence when they walk on the field,\"\\ntunney said. \"it\\'s easy for officials to get intimidated. and in\\ntoday\\'s environment, they have to keep building confidence. i\\'ve\\nbeen afraid in situations, concerned about if i\\'m doing the right\\nthing.\"\\n\\none primary argument against replay, mckay said, was that\\nofficials might start second-guessing themselves before making\\ncalls because mistakes would be immediately exposed. but now,\\npereira said, replay forces officials to improve. historically, 33\\npercent to 38 percent of calls have been overturned by replay, he\\nsaid. in the first third of this season, he said, only 19 percent\\nwere overturned. pereira said officials had improved on calling\\nsideline catches, which might account for the shift.\\n\\nbut there is little thirst for more calls to be reviewable. the\\ncompetition committee will probably review the pass/fumble rule\\nthat tripped up hochuli, although pereira and anderson have\\nreservations about changing it because quarterbacks could be\\nendangered as players pursue what may or may not be a fumble.\\n\\nbut there is almost no chance that pass interference will be\\nreviewable soon. now, there are 1.1 stoppages for replay a game. if\\nthe replay rules were broadened, the average could rise to four\\nstoppages, pereira said.\\n\\n\"i think we\\'re all happy the system hasn\\'t been too\\nintrusive,\" he said.\\n\\nperhaps so, even if it is not perfect. in the meantime,\\npereira\\'s mailbox fills up while his officials try to tune out the\\ndin.\\n\\n\"we have criticism from the days of officiating pop warner when\\nparents yell at you from sidelines,\" pereira said. \"i don\\'t like\\nit, but it\\'s not the thing i focus on.\"\\n\\ndenver -- democrat barack obama has solidified his base and\\npicked up a majority of unaffiliated voters in colorado, giving him\\na five percentage point lead over republican john mccain, according\\nto a new denver post poll.\\n\\nwith only 72 hours remaining in the presidential campaign, the\\nresults -- in addition to other statewide polls showing mccain\\ntrailing obama -- indicates that the arizona senator faces\\nsubstantial challenges in winning colorado.\\n\\noverall, obama leads mccain 49 percent to 44 percent. colorado\\nunaffiliated voters, the critical voting bloc making up more than\\none-third of the electorate, are backing obama 57 percent to 32\\npercent. four percent of those polled, however, are still\\nundecided.\\n\\nin a denver post poll one month ago, the two candidates were\\ntied, with 8 percent of voters undecided. since then, obama has\\nincreased his lead over mccain among men, women, independents and\\nvoters over 35 years old.\\n\\nbrad coker, pollster for mason-dixon polling &amp;amp; research who\\nconducted the poll for the post, said the number of undecideds in\\ncolorado is smaller than in other battleground states. while those\\nvoters could have an impact, especially if they all throw their\\nweight behind mccain, obama has momentum.\\n\\n\"obama looks like he\\'s in good shape. even if all the\\nundecided\\'s break to mccain, obama could likely still hang on,\"\\ncoker said.\\n\\nmccain spokesman tom kise said in the final few days of a\\ncampaign polls are \"all over the board.\"\\n\\n\"the only poll that is going to matter is the one on election\\nday,\" he said. \"in these last 96 hours ... we are fully confident\\nthat we will turn our people out and colorado will be a red state\\non election day.\"\\n\\nin the past 44 years, the state has voted for a democratic\\npresidential candidate only once: bill clinton in 1992. so even\\nwith a lead, the obama campaign is not taking the state for\\ngranted. the illinois senator attended a campaign rally in pueblo\\non saturday.\\n\\nobama campaign manager david plouffe said he thinks independent\\nvoters in colorado will continue to \"break decisively\" for obama.\\n\\nin colorado and nationally, plouffe disputed the notion that\\nundecided voters will trend en masse to mccain.\\n\\n\"we reject that 90 percent of the undecideds will go for\\nmccain,\" plouffe said in a conference call friday. \"some states\\nwill split evenly, some will break a little more to him, some more\\nto us.\"\\n\\ncolorado voters, as those in the rest of the nation,\\noverwhelmingly cited the economy as the most important national\\nissue facing the country, and obama narrowly edges out mccain on\\nthe question of who is best able to handle economic issues.\\n\\nhe also is ahead of mccain on environmental and public-land\\nissues, developing energy resources and improving health

denver post\\n\\nthe nfl\\'s crackdown on player safety has produced lots of\\npenalties, big fines and a bit of confusion.\\n\\naccording to the nfl, it levied 139 fines for playing rules\\nviolations in the weeks preceding the games of oct. 26. that, it\\nsaid, was up marginally from last year. many of those fines were\\nfor plays that did not draw a flag during the game, although\\naccording to footballoutsiders.com, which tracks penalties, calls\\nfor unnecessary roughness through week 7 were at 75, way higher\\nthan last year\\'s 43.\\n\\ndo the after-the-fact fines and suspensions undermine the\\nofficials if a penalty was not called? the nfl said that those\\nsanctions did not.\\n\\n\"you can\\'t humanly catch all the things that might happen,\\nparticularly if it\\'s away from the play,\" ray anderson, the nfl\\'s\\nexecutive vice president for football operations, said. \"it\\'s no\\nrap on the officials that they might not catch a helmet-to-helmet\\nhit at full speed on the other side of the field.\"\\n\\nthe nfl also uses tape of hits that draw fines as a tool to\\nteach officials what kind of hits it wants penalized. still, when\\nplayers appeal fines or suspensions, their first argument is\\nobvious: how can it draw a fine if a flag was not thrown?\\n\\nthat was one of the issues anderson addressed when he met with\\nmembers of the pittsburgh steelers two weeks ago, after several\\nsteelers players publicly questioned the emphasis on player safety.\\nsafety troy polamalu said the fines for hits -- several steelers,\\nincluding hines ward, have been fined for hits that did not draw\\nflags -- was turning the nfl into a \"pansy\" league.\\n\\n\"we understand it\\'s a tough, aggressive game, and players have\\nalways played

press on friday.\\n\\nthe disclosure came as the presidential campaign hurtled toward\\nelection day on tuesday, and it left the obama campaign answering\\nquestions about what he knew of her situation.\\n\\nsome democrats suggested that the timing of the disclosure could\\nhave been politically motivated, and some immigration lawyers said\\nthat for government officials to disclose information about an\\nasylum applicant was unethical or perhaps illegal.\\n\\n\"people are suspicious about stories that surface in the last\\n72 hours of a national campaign, and i think they\\'re going to put\\nit in that context,\" david axelrod, obama\\'s chief strategist, told\\nreporters on saturday.\\n\\nsen. john mccain\\'s campaign declined to comment, and neither\\nmccain nor his running mate, gov. sarah palin, raised the issue on\\nthe campaign trail.\\n\\nkelly nantel, a spokeswoman for the u.s. immigration and customs\\nenforcement agency, said that the matter had been referred to the\\nagency\\'s inspector general and office of professional\\nresponsibility. nantel said that she could not comment on the\\nmatter. a white house spokesman, scott stanzel, said the white\\nhouse had no involvement in the matter. onyango is the half-sister\\nof obama\\'s father and is part of an extensive network of paternal\\nrelatives with whom obama has had limited contact, his aides said.\\nobama, who was largely raised by his maternal grandparents in\\nhonolulu, first met onyango when he traveled to africa as an adult.\\n\\naxelrod said that obama and onyango did not have \"a real close\\nrelationship.\"\\n\\nonyango attended the ceremony when obama was sworn in to the\\nu.s. senate in 2004, but campaign officials said the senator had\\nprovided no assistance in getting her a tourist visa and did not\\nknow the details of her stay. at the time of the ceremony, onyango\\nand another relative said in interviews that they had flown to the\\nunited states from kenya to witness the moment.\\n\\nobama last heard from her about two years ago when she called to\\nsay she was in boston, but he did not see her there, the campaign\\nsaid.\\n\\nfederal election commission records list a zeituni onyango in\\nsouth boston as making a series of contributions, totaling $265, to\\nthe obama campaign, with the most recent contribution, $5, made on\\nsept. 19.\\n\\nobama\\'s campaign said the money was being refunded. it is\\nillegal for foreign citizens and immigrants without green cards to\\nmake political donations. aides said that the donations came\\nthrough the normal channels, and that no one at the campaign knew\\nthat onyango was related to obama or of her immigration status.\\n\\nthe times of london first reported on thursday that onyango\\nlived in public housing in boston. on friday, the associated press\\nreported that she was in the country illegally and that her case\\nhad led to an unusual nationwide directive from the immigrations\\nand customs enforcement requiring that any deportations before\\ntuesday\\'s election be approved at least at the level of regional\\ndirectors.\\n\\nonyango lives in a disabled-access apartment, and worked as a\\nvolunteer resident health advocate for the boston housing authority\\nbefore stopping recently for physical therapy following back\\nsurgery, said william mcgonagle, deputy director of the authority.\\n\\non saturday, a police officer was stationed outside the low\\nbrick public housing complex where onyango lives. the officer said\\nshe was not at home and told reporters not to enter the building.\\n\\nthe new york times said in editorials for sunday, nov. 2:\\n\\n      island of lost homes\\n\\nas the financial crisis crisscrosses the globe, mutating as it\\ngoes, it is important to remember the brownfield of bad american\\nhome loans that are its ground zero. the view is ugly, the effects\\ndire and the need for solutions just as urgent whether you look in\\nthe stucco foreclosure tracts of phoenix and southern california,\\nthe condo-boom cities like miami -- or a birthplace of the suburban\\namerican dream, long island.\\n\\nlong island\\'s two counties, suffolk and nassau, are first and\\nfourth in the number of loans at risk of foreclosure in new york\\nstate. long island was not supposed to be hit this hard, because of\\nits affluence, highly desirable housing stock and relative lack of\\nroom to sprawl. but for lots of reasons distinctly its own, it was\\nhighly susceptible to the toxic fallout of the subprime bubble.\\n\\nlong island has two housing crises, an acute new one laid over a\\nchronic old one. the old one is a severe shortage of housing for\\nregular people, in a market pathologically skewed by racial\\nsegregation and not-in-my-backyard resistance to responsible\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nhousing in the land of levittown, the national symbol of\\naffordable starter homes, has for years been out of reach to young\\ncouples and the working class. thousands of long islanders of\\nmodest means, from young professionals to immigrant day laborers,\\nare crowding into illegally subdivided single-family houses.\\ndemographers have documented an exodus of people who grew sick of\\nliving in their parents\\' basements, while retirees rattled around\\nin empty nests, cash-poor but property-rich -- at least until the\\nmortgage meltdown.\\n\\nfor all that, there are few legal rental units, and efforts to\\nbuild higher-density \"smart growth\" developments have been\\nvigorously, often rabidly, opposed by communities wedded to the\\nsingle-family house behind the white picket fence. mcmansions have\\nbeen eating up the island\\'s dwindling open space and farmland,\\nwhile its downtowns and infrastructure wither from age and neglect.\\n\\nto top it off, the island remains one of the most segregated\\nsuburbs in the country, designed from the days of its earliest\\ntract homes to be a haven of white aspiration. for years,\\nafrican-american homeowners were shunted to tightly bounded\\nneighborhoods that became self-perpetuating pockets of poverty with\\nseverely underperforming school districts.\\n\\nit is little wonder that within long island\\'s dysfunctional\\nhousing market, where more than half of residents spend more than\\n30 percent of their income on housing, the lure of easy credit was\\nirresistible. mortgage lenders cajoled the elderly to plunder their\\nequity, people in heavily minority areas like hempstead village,\\namityville and brentwood lined up for the subprime express,\\ninvestors snapped up homes for illegal rentals, and trader-uppers\\nin richer zip codes dived in over their heads.\\n\\nadvocates who had struggled to get poor people into housing\\nrealized a few years ago that things were moving too fast. peter\\nelkowitz, chief executive of the long island housing partnership,\\nsaid people at the group\\'s home-ownership workshops would sometimes\\nbristle at being told what they could not afford and take their\\nbusiness to storefront brokers who offered no-income-verification\\nloans and the false promise that home values would keep rising\\nforever.\\n\\nnow it is all crashing down. the ranch homes have plywood\\npicture windows, and front lawns sprout billboards for foreclosure\\nauctions. the disaster is particularly acute in black and latino\\ncommunities, where subprime loans were advertised heavily. the\\nempire justice center found that the three suffolk communities with\\nthe highest foreclosure risk -- amityville, brentwood and central\\nislip -- are home to a full 30 percent of the county\\'s\\nafrican-american homeowners. nassau\\'s three hardest-hit areas --\\nhempstead, freeport and elmont -- are home to 42 percent of its\\nblack homeowners.\\n\\nthe county executives of nassau and suffolk, thomas suozzi and\\nsteve levy, have ramped up services like debt counseling to keep\\nthe next wave of troubled homeowners from defaulting when their\\nadjustable-rate mortgages reset next year. but the counties are\\nstruggling to keep their own budgets right-side-up in a wretched\\neconomy. new york state\\'s deficit is mountainous, and levy and\\nsuozzi expect to get hammered on aid from albany, even as their own\\nsales taxes and property-transfer taxes dwindle.\\n\\ncrime is not up yet, but homelessness and hunger are. so is\\nblight: town and village officials have their hands full keeping\\nlawns mowed for a glut of abandoned houses. the bottom-feeders are\\nout: \"we buy houses,\" read the light-post fliers in poor\\nneighborhoods, offering fast cash for troubled homes. brokers who\\nshamelessly peddled subprime loans to unqualified buyers are now\\noffering, for thousands of dollars in fees, to fix people\\'s credit,\\nconvert their loans and negotiate with lenders -- the same thing\\nnonprofit groups do at no charge.\\n\\nthis disaster was caused by a torrent of bad loans, but there\\nhas been only a trickle of the money and leadership needed from\\nwashington, where the focus has been on bailing out banks before\\nhomeowners. at a training workshop at the long island housing\\npartnership in hauppauge last week, representatives of citibank met\\nwith nonprofit groups to explore ways to repair mortgages so that\\nfamilies can keep their homes for the life of the loans, and not\\nsimply postpone inevitable foreclosures.\\n\\nthe emphasis was on realism and honesty in a world that\\njettisoned both. participants agreed that a solution as big as the\\nproblem had not yet been devised. lenders, homeowners and advocates\\nare stuck with straightening out a colossal mess, one bad loan at a\\ntime.\\n\\ngone missing\\n\\never since sept. 11, 2001, the world has shuddered at the\\npossibility of loose nuclear weapons or radioactive material\\nfalling into the hands of terrorists. shuddered and done too little\\nto stop it.\\n\\nmohamed elbaradei, the head of the international atomic energy\\nagency, warned last week that there has been a \"disturbingly\\nhigh\" number of reports of missing or illegally trafficked nuclear\\nmaterial. according to agency figures, there were 243 incidents\\nbetween june 2007 and june of this year. fortunately, the amounts\\nreported missing have been small. some experts say that if all the\\nmaterial were lumped together it would not be enough for one\\nnuclear weapon. that is no consolation in a world where so many\\ncountries are eager to build their own nuclear reactors and\\npossibly nuclear weapons.\\n\\nthat means that in coming years there will be even more states\\nwith nuclear materials, more scientists with nuclear knowledge and\\nmore opportunities for terrorists to get their hands on the\\nmaterial for a bomb.\\n\\nit is the atomic agency\\'s job to keep tabs on civilian nuclear\\nprograms, to ensure that states do not misplace fuel or divert it\\nto clandestine weapons programs. one way to guard against such a\\nperilous future is to ensure that the agency is fully staffed with\\nthe best people available and has the money and support it needs.\\n\\nmember states must be willing to increase their budget\\ncontributions so the agency can refurbish its testing laboratory,\\ninvest in new technology and hire additional nuclear experts. the\\nagency must also be ready to take on new tasks, like administering\\na nuclear fuel bank to be the supplier of last resort for countries\\nthat choose not to get into the risky reactor fuel business.\\n(producing nuclear fuel is the hardest part of building a nuclear\\nweapon.)\\n\\nelbaradei completes his term at the end of 2009. his successor\\nmust be knowledgeable, politically skilled -- but less likely to\\ngive iran the benefit of the doubt at crucial moments -- and ready\\nto help lead a global campaign to secure dangerous nuclear\\nmaterials and constrain the world\\'s nuclear appetites.\\n\\npresident bush spent far too much energy trying to oust\\nelbaradei and far too little on arms reduction and restraining the\\nspread of nuclear technology and know-how. barack obama and john\\nmccain both say they understand the many threats out there. we hope\\nthey also see the urgency.\\n\\nbetween phone calls and sips of coffee, maggie mccomas enjoyed\\nthe crisp, sunny sunday on beatrice sibblies\\' front stoop on west\\n121st street. the battleground states of pennsylvania and new\\nhampshire seemed far away as she sat back in her folding chair with\\nsheets of voters\\' names and numbers.\\n\\nmccomas, 63, of the upper west side, picked up one of two cell\\nphones from the chair in front of her. one was hers, the other\\nborrowed from a friend, and with the minutes from both, she was\\nready to make \"hours\" of calls for barack obama. and soon, she\\nsaid, she would be knocking on doors in pennsylvania. \"i haven\\'t\\ndone that since i sold girl scout cookies,\" she said.\\n\\ninside the house, a dozen callers spread out on the stairs, on\\nthe sofa and chairs, at the dining room table and in the kitchen.\\nit was the third weekend cell phone bank held by sibblies, 39, a\\nreal estate developer and ardent supporter of obama.\\n\\n\"a lot of people here have never done this before, and they\\'re\\na little nervous,\" she said.\\n\\nbut it was not just the fear of making cold calls that was\\nmaking her guests unsure. many spoke of being anxious as election\\nday drew closer, feeling that as new yorkers, their votes \"would\\nnot count.\" most had come out on a beautiful sunday to try to do\\nsomething to swing the vote in the states that \"matter.\"\\n\\nfrom the sputnik bar in clinton hill, brooklyn, to the bowery\\nhotel in the east village, to sibblies\\' pink-brick town house in\\nharlem, supporters of sen. obama gathered across the city. they\\nmade in-kind donations of their cell phone minutes to reach out to\\nvoters in the more mottled states that are likely to decide this\\npresidential election.\\n\\nsupporters of sen. john mccain held a similar drive at the\\ncampaign\\'s regional headquarters in woodbridge, n.j., a 40-minute\\ndrive from midtown.\\n\\nabout a dozen new yorkers, most of them from staten island, made\\nthe trip last weekend, according to stephanie fila, the volunteer\\ncoordinator. on monday night, supporters of mccain filled the phone\\nroom in woodbridge, pounding out pennsylvania and new jersey area\\ncodes on 18 black office phones. they sat close together at folding\\ntables. photographs of the senator, snapshots of volunteers and a\\nlarge banner -- \"small business leaders for mccain\" -- decorated\\nthe walls.\\n\\n\"on tuesday nights, it\\'s veterans calling veterans, and i come\\nto that, too,\" said jim bellina, 55, of skillman, n.j., who served\\nin the navy. he said he was confident despite polls showing his\\ncandidate trailing. \"let me put it this way: this is the fourth\\nquarter in a football game, and we\\'re having a tough time. but if\\nyou know senator mccain, you know he ain\\'t got no quit.\"\\n\\nif history, voting registration and polls are any indication,\\nnew york city will vote democratic in tuesday\\'s presidential\\nelection, as it has every time since 1924, when calvin coolidge, a\\nrepublican, pulled out a victory in a three-way race that saw\\ndemocratic voters siphoned off by the progressive party.\\n\\nas of march 1, there were 2.8 million registered democrats in\\nthe city, compared with a little more than half a million\\nrepublicans, according to the most recent numbers from the board of\\nelections. the goal for strategists of both parties is to marshal\\nstrong supporters here to change minds and get out the vote in\\nswing states.\\n\\n\"we\\'re seeking to harness the enthusiasm in new york to help\\nout in other states,\" said blake zeff, the director of\\ncommunications for the obama campaign in new york. more than 3,000\\nvolunteers made roughly 180,000 calls last weekend, according to\\nstatistics provided by the campaign.\\n\\nfor this final weekend, the obama campaign said it would be\\nramping up its \"last call for change\" effort, creating a handful\\nof supersize phone banks to accommodate hundreds of callers, in\\naddition to more than 20 smaller sites.\\n\\nin woodbridge, where more than 200,000 calls have been made for\\nmccain, they will be hammering away until election day, according\\nto the campaign. new york supporters of mccain, however, will not\\nfind any official phone banks in the city, though they might happen\\nupon the candidate himself on his way from rockefeller center to\\nnew hampshire on sunday morning after his scheduled appearance on\\n\"saturday night live.\"\\n\\nthe campaign is likewise encouraging supporters to head to the\\nbattleground state of pennsylvania to knock on doors.\\n\\nwith the end nearing, the emotions of voters on both sides\\nseemed to be gathering strength. some described having troubled\\nsleep and even more troubling dreams.\\n\\n\"i had a dream the other night that obama won, and i woke up so\\nhappy,\" said melissa gluck, 30, of forest hills, queens, who came\\nwith a friend to sibblies\\' house to make calls. \"but then, i felt\\na sense of panic.\"\\n\\nat a much larger phone event for obama, at the bowery hotel,\\nralph stern, 83, also said he had lost sleep over the impending\\nelection.\\n\\n\"i get a little shaky,\" he said, making calls with his wife,\\narlene, at a wicker table in the lobby. \"i get panicky.\"\\n\\njamie lynn, 27, a waitress and college student who lives in\\nwoodbridge, was making calls on behalf of mccain. she said that for\\nthree nights she had been \"having trouble sleeping, nightmares\"\\nabout what would happen if obama were elected. in her dream, there\\nwere riots, she said. she had been making calls every weekday for\\ntwo weeks and would continue until the election.\\n\\nno one seemed nervous about making dozens of cold calls to\\nstrangers in faraway towns. \"what\\'s the worst that could happen?\"\\nsaid edward bishop, 63, of monroe township, n.j. \"they hang up on\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"or,\" he added, \"i guess they could say they\\'re voting for\\nobama.\"\\n\\nafter eight years of economic policies custom-made for the hedge\\nfund set, it is great to hear the economic interests of the middle\\nclass mentioned so often in the presidential campaign. as the\\ncandidates enthuse about all they intend to do for this important\\nsegment of american society, it would be helpful if they also\\nspecify what they mean by \"middle.\"\\n\\nit is puzzling when barack obama suggests a tax cut for a middle\\nclass that earns all the way up to $200,000 a year. when john\\nmccain drew the border between the middle class and the rich at $5\\nmillion a year, it brought to mind marie antoinette\\'s musings about\\ndessert.\\n\\nthere is such a thing as a straightforward middle. the nation\\'s\\nmedian household income last year was $50,233. half of all\\nhouseholds earned more and half earned less. some economists would\\ndefine the middle class as those who earn between 75 percent and\\n125 percent of that -- say households making between $37,500 and\\n$63,000.\\n\\ndevelopment economists sometimes define the middle class as\\nthose making more than the bottom fifth of the population but less\\nthan the top fifth. in this country, that would include households\\nmaking between $20,291 and $100,000. of course, there are places --\\nnew york comes to mind -- where $150,000 a year does not buy many of\\nthe trappings of wealth.\\n\\nthe heavy use of the term seems to be more than an appeal to\\npeople\\'s wallets. \"middle class\" has become less a position on\\nthe income scale than a state of being. according to a poll by the\\npew research center, a little more than half of americans consider\\nthemselves middle class, including a third of those who make more\\nthan $150,000 per year. for many people, to be \"middle class\" is\\nto work hard, to struggle to succeed, often against unfair forces.\\nforget the money.\\n\\npraising and promising to reward the middle class is a way for\\nthe candidates to stroke the self-esteem of all those who identify\\nthemselves as good, hard-working americans. and this makes it a\\nvery useful term.\\n\\nmccain hopes heavy use of the term inoculates him against the\\ncharge that he is carrying water for the same moneyed set that\\ngeorge w. bush does. obama is hoping it can protect him from\\ncharges that he is too eager to redistribute the wealth of the\\nrich, and those who hope to be.\\n\\nthe coded language also has real costs. one is that it displaces\\nnecessary words like poverty. these days, the candidates rarely\\ntalk about the poor, except when they are talking about the risk\\nthat people might drop out of the middle class. given what is going\\non in the economy, that fear might well reach up to $200,000 a\\nyear.\\n\\nwhile waiting for her parents outside the pro shop, song-hee kim\\ntook her sand wedge and bounced a ball off the toe, then the heel.\\nafter a dozen bounces, kim froze the ball on the face of the club\\nand spun it as if she were a chef sauteing it. by the time the ball\\nstopped spinning, she held a small crowd in her sway.\\n\\nthis was how kim began one of her best weeks as a professional,\\nby entertaining lpga fans last month at the samsung world\\nchampionship in half moon bay, calif. the week ended with kim, a\\n20-year-old south korean, in second place, one stroke behind paula\\ncreamer, and panic-stricken about speaking to american reporters.\\n\\nkim felt enormous pressure to conduct her news conference in\\nenglish because of lpga commissioner carolyn bivens\\' short-lived\\nproposal that foreign-born players with two years\\' experience on\\nthe tour be proficient in english or face suspension beginning in\\n2009.\\n\\nentertaining answers are not a trick kim can pull out of her\\nbag. growing up in south korea, she spent countless hours\\naddressing a golf ball but rarely an audience, public speaking\\nbeing a skill that is not encouraged. although kim speaks english\\nwell enough to have been her mother\\'s interpreter during the\\ntournament, she opted to play it safe. she spoke in korean while an\\nlpga official translated.\\n\\nand another chance to shine a light on a tour personality was\\nlost in the translation.\\n\\nalthough language has become a primary talking point on the\\ntour, the cultural gap may be wider than any english-speaking\\npolicy can bridge. bivens has since strained relations more by\\nindicating that her plan was also meant to help the south korean\\nplayers shake their omnipresent fathers. by singling out the south\\nkoreans, bivens has reduced them to one-dimensional stock\\ncharacters, which is like reading no break in a putt on a contoured\\ngreen.\\n\\nwalking the fairways of the lpga tour for two weeks, one finds\\nthat the south korean players are an eclectic and varied lot who\\nlove their parents, facebook and pumpkin pie. they are crazy about\\npurses, texting and practicing, and manage to balance a lot of\\ncomplex relationships, including their often confused feelings\\nabout golf.\\n\\nan evolving image\\n\\nthe lpga tour is the longest-running and most successful\\nprofessional women\\'s sports organization. its image has undergone\\nmore makeovers in its 58 years of existence than betty crocker:\\nfrom dilettante to tomboy to pin-up to postfeminist and, much more\\nrecently, to multinational.\\n\\nthis year, 120 players -- half the tour\\'s membership -- are from\\noutside the united states. of those, 45 are from south korea. they\\nhave won seven tournaments this year and have eight players among\\nthe top 20 money earners. the pipeline shows no signs of drying up\\nas more than three dozen south koreans competed this year on the\\nfutures tour, the lpga\\'s development circuit.\\n\\nthe influx of international talent comes as the tour has\\nrecently lost four title sponsors and has yet to complete a\\ntelevision deal beyond the one with espn and the golf channel that\\nexpires next year.\\n\\nwhen she met with south korean players in august, bivens said\\nshe had received complaints from corporate sponsors in the\\nlucrative pro-ams because some lpga players could not schmooze in\\nenglish. after the details of her language-proficiency policy were\\nleaked, the public outcry was louder than any gallery roar.\\n\\nwithin two weeks, the lpga announced it was rescinding the\\nthreat of suspension but maintaining its expectation -- fostered\\nthrough its program of language tutors and software programs -- that\\nplaying members would become proficient in english.\\n\\nbivens\\'s motivation extends beyond the fiscal health of the\\ntour. in a recent interview, she said her goal was to help\\nassimilate the south korean players into a culture starkly\\ndifferent from their own and to emancipate them from what she\\ncharacterized as overbearing fathers. forcing the players to learn\\nenglish and threatening their livelihoods was the best way she saw\\nto accomplish that.\\n\\n\"the language is part of the control the parents have over\\ntheir young daughters,\" bivens said. \"if they don\\'t even know\\nsurvival english, they\\'re totally dependent on the dad.\"\\n\\nseon hwa lee, the lpga rookie of the year in 2006 and a two-time\\nwinner this year, is considered one of the quieter south koreans,\\nbut she was outspoken about bivens\\' emancipation proclamation. \"i\\ndon\\'t think that\\'s her job,\" lee said.\\n\\n(begin optional trim.)\\n\\n      father, father\\n\\nchristina kim, a 24-year-old who dresses to blind and has a neon\\nnature, has a split personality, cavorting like the american

herself as being not just the life\\nof the party, but the party itself. during the pro-am at a\\ntournament in danville, calif., she was the perfect hostess,\\ndrawing out her golf partners by asking them personal questions. by\\nthe end of the round, they were exchanging fist pumps and contact\\ninformation.\\n\\nlater, christina motioned for a reporter to take the golf cart\\nseat her father, man kim, had just vacated.\\n\\nat the mention of bivens\\' name, man kim, who was standing in his\\ndaughter\\'s shadow, leaned into the cart and spoke to her in korean.\\nhe interrupted her repeatedly as they discussed whether she ought\\nto continue.\\n\\n\"dad,\" she said finally, \"either you listen or whatever, but\\ndon\\'t do my interview for me.\"\\n\\nwhen asked later about her father, she wrote in an e-mail\\nmessage: \"regardless of what people think, my father and i have\\nalways had a great relationship. we would come to raised voices,\\nbut which family has never done that before? i always have and\\nalways will defend my father\\'s role in my career, both as a caddie,\\ncoach and father. he sacrificed so much to get me to this point in\\nmy life.\"\\n\\nin korean culture, parents will do whatever is necessary to help\\ntheir children\\'s prospects. they have a name for it, child farming,\\nand cultivating successful sons and daughters confers great\\nprestige on the parents. for golfers, that means fathers leave\\ntheir jobs to travel the circuit and serve their daughters in many\\nunofficial roles: coach, caddie, chauffeur, counselor, critic and\\ncook.\\n\\nat night during the danville tournament, the halls of an\\nextended stay america hotel smelled of garlic and kimchi as parents\\nof the south korean players made dinner. filial obedience and\\nfinancial independence are not mutually exclusive to the south\\nkoreans, who see nothing contradictory about taking home the\\nbulgogi (barbecue beef) and letting their mothers or fathers fry it\\nup in a pan.\\n\\nsome of the fathers turn up the heat, pushing their daughters to\\npractice and berating them when they do not play well. three\\ncaddies who work for them said there were a handful of south korean\\nplayers on the tour who have been ostracized by their compatriots\\nbecause of their overzealous fathers.\\n\\nchristina kim said: \"i can understand and appreciate what\\ncarolyn is trying to do in regards to emancipating korean players\\nfrom their fathers. however, it is my firm belief that just like in\\nany other culture, one has to go and reclaim

turned pro at 14 and won her first event on the\\nsouth korean lpga tour the next year. song-hee kim was 17 when she\\nwon on the futures tour in 2006. when lee and song-hee kim gained\\ntheir full lpga privileges, they were cocooned teenagers not quite\\nready to be social butterflies.\\n\\nat last year\\'s pro-am in danville, chuck rydell, an employee of\\nthe tournament sponsor longs drugs, was paired with a young south\\nkorean who spoke little english. he said he spent an enjoyable\\nround teaching her american curse words.\\n\\nthis year, his pro partner was sun young yoo, a 21-year-old who\\nis known among the south koreans as the course clown. she made\\nrydell laugh when the windshield in her cart flew off. without\\nmissing a beat, yoo said, \"maybe we are going to lose tires\\nnext.\"\\n\\nthe pro-ams are like a roving cocktail party, with plus-fours\\ninstead of petit fours, and entry fees of $3,500 to $12,000 a\\nperson. coolers around the course are stocked with soda and beer;\\ngolf is the ice-breaker for conversation. this kind of socializing\\nis new to the south koreans, who may even consider it improper. in\\ntheir culture, it is unusual for young people to mingle with older\\nstrangers.\\n\\njuli inkster, who has had a front-row seat for golf\\'s\\nglobalization during her 26-year lpga career, said: \"you put an\\n18- or 19-year-old girl that\\'s maybe not comfortable with her\\nenglish with four ceos, men or women, she is not going to feel\\ncomfortable going up there and making small talk. that\\'s not the\\nway they are brought up.\"\\n\\nwith a little ingenuity, this gap can be bridged. for the last\\ntwo years, the tour stop in portland, ore., has held a separate\\npro-am for korean-speaking players. they are paired with\\nkorean-speaking amateurs for 18 holes, and a meal catered by a\\nlocal korean establishment is served afterward. everybody wins. the\\nplayers gain practice interacting with strangers, and the\\ntournament is tapping into a new fan base. this year, the portland\\ntournament sent out nine foursomes with south korean pros, up from\\nfive in 2007.\\n\\namong the players who took part in this year\\'s south korean\\npro-am was song-hee kim. one of 10 players on the tour this year\\nwith the surname kim, song-hee is easy to pick out. she walks the\\ncourse with a thoroughbred\\'s gait and favors short, cropped hair\\nand long pants. until she signed a clothing contract with fila, her\\nfather was her stylist. he bought her shirts in pro shops, choosing\\nwhat he might wear himself.\\n\\nsong-hee\\'s kim\\'s personality is blossoming with her golf game.\\none day she left the practice green with a messenger bag slung over\\nher right shoulder. the swedish veteran helen alfredsson touched\\nthe flap and purred, \"nice bag, song-hee.\"\\n\\nbeaming, kim said her coach had helped her choose the louis\\nvuitton, the first purse she had ever owned. her english was\\nperfect.\\n\\nflorida\\'s annual game against georgia here\\nis known as the world\\'s largest outdoor cocktail party, a testament\\nto the pervasive tailgating scene.\\n\\nbut as cocktail parties go, saturday\\'s on-field edition of the\\nheated rivalry had the style of a kegger in the woods rather than a\\nmidtown martini soir?e.\\n\\nno. 5 florida pasted no. 8 georgia, 49-10, the second-worst\\nbeating the bulldogs have taken in a series that began in 1915.\\n\\nif revenge is best served cold, florida\\'s victory could be\\nconsidered an ice bath. georgia enraged florida\\'s players and\\ncoaches last season by sending 70 players out to celebrate its\\nfirst touchdown. georgia won, and that celebration resonated as\\nmuch as any moment in college football last season.\\n\\ncold can also describe saturday\\'s postgame handshake between\\nflorida coach urban meyer and georgia coach mark richt, a brush-by\\nwith no eye contact, straight out of the bill belichick playbook.\\n\\nwhile florida did not respond with a specific ploy, the gators\\ndelivered a historic victory. the lopsided tenor of the victory\\nmade a soothsayer out of meyer, who wrote in his autobiography this\\nsummer, \"we\\'ll handle it, and it\\'s going to be a big deal.\"\\n\\nflorida (7-1, 5-1 southeastern conference) called two timeouts\\nin the final minute to relish the victory, rubbing in the worst\\nloss of richt\\'s tenure at georgia. florida has won 16 of its past\\n19 meetings with georgia.\\n\\ntim tebow ran for three touchdowns and threw for two others, as\\nflorida took hold of the eastern division of the sec and reasserted\\nitself into the bowl championship series title race. but most of\\nflorida\\'s success on a muggy afternoon came from georgia\\'s\\nself-inflicted wounds.\\n\\nin a fog of penalties, matthew stafford interceptions, knowshon\\nmoreno blunders and one baffling coaching decision by richt,\\ngeorgia\\'s season of great expectations melted into one of extreme\\ndisappointment.\\n\\ngeorgia (7-2, 4-2) began the season as the country\\'s no. 1 team,\\nbut this season will probably be defined by their staggering\\nineptitude saturday.\\n\\nthe debate around college football next week will be whether\\nflorida can sneak into one of the top two spots in the bcs\\nstandings, but the debate in athens will be about which of\\ngeorgia\\'s star offensive players played worse.\\n\\nstafford, considered the country\\'s best quarterback prospect by\\nmany nfl scouts, turned the game with a critical interception in\\nthe third quarter that joe haden returned 88 yards to the 1.\\nstafford badly underthrew the freshman receiver a.j. green on the\\nplay. stafford then fueled the blowout with two more interceptions\\nthat turned into gators scores.\\n\\nstafford finished 18 for 33 with 267 yards and no touchdowns.\\nstafford may be a better professional prospect, but tebow\\noutclassed him. tebow finished 10 of 13 passing for 154 yards and 2\\ntouchdowns. florida scored seven touchdowns, had no turnovers and\\nhas averaged 54.3 points in victories over louisiana state,\\nkentucky and georgia its past three games.\\n\\nmoreno had a beautifully thrown ball by stafford hit him off the\\nface mask late in the second quarter with georgia trailing, 14-3.\\ngeorgia had to settle for a field-goal attempt, which blair walsh\\nplunked off the left upright from 27 yards out.\\n\\ngeorgia went into halftime behind by 14-3, and haden\\'s\\ninterception turned the game. but moreno did not help when he\\nfailed to catch a pitch from stafford that florida defensive\\nlineman terron sanders picked up. he pirouetted, then ran for 30\\nyards.\\n\\ntebow scored from 8 yards out two plays later, florida led by\\n35-3, and the georgia fans poured to the exits.\\n\\nthe first florida touchdown came after an illegal-contact\\npenalty by georgia\\'s jarius wynn negated a tebow interception. the\\npenalty accounted for 14 yards, and florida scored two plays later\\non a 13-yard option run by percy harvin.\\n\\nafter georgia answered that score with a field goal, richt\\ninexplicably decided to try an onside kick. the florida walk-on\\nholder butch rowley recovered, and the gators took over in georgia\\nterritory. tebow immediately found tight end aaron hernandez for an\\n18-yard pass, starting a drive that he ended with a 1-yard\\ntouchdown run on fourth down.\\n\\nwith the ball on the florida 6, georgia imploded. stafford\\nmissed tight end tripp chandler, who was running alone in the end\\nzone, on first down. moreno was stuffed on an uninspired run on\\nsecond down, and the ball plunked his face mask on third down. he\\nflailed to the officials for a pass-interference call, which summed\\nup georgia\\'s ineptitude on the day.\\n\\ngeorgia\\'s success against florida ended with a distinctive thud.\\nand this cocktail party ended like so many others, with the\\nbulldogs looking up at florida in the sec standings. the yearlong\\nhangover begins sunday morning.\\n\\na federal judge has appointed a temporary receiver for a kosher\\nmeatpacking company in iowa after a bank said that the company had\\ndefaulted on a $35 million loan and that it had written $1.4\\nmillion in bad checks.\\n\\nthe loan foreclosure against the company, agriprocessors inc.,\\nwas the latest in a cascade of troubles that have come after nearly\\n400 illegal immigrant workers were arrested in a raid in may at its\\nplant in postville, iowa. on thursday, sholom rubashkin, the former\\nchief executive, was arrested in iowa on federal charges of\\nconspiring to harbor illegal immigrants.\\n\\nin a lawsuit filed thursday in federal court in cedar rapids,\\nfirst bank business capital of st. louis claimed that\\nagriprocessors had failed to maintain enough cash in designated\\nbank accounts to stay current on the revolving loan it took out in\\n1999. the lawsuit was first reported friday on the web site of the\\nforward, a jewish newspaper.\\n\\nthe suit also claims that agriprocessors violated the loan terms\\nby diverting nearly $1.4 million from first bank accounts to\\nanother bank to issue payroll checks on oct. 24. first bank learned\\nthat those checks were returned for insufficient funds, the lawsuit\\nsays.\\n\\nthe suit says agriprocessors had begun to fall behind on the\\nrevolving loan during the quarter that ended march 31, suggesting\\nthat its financial woes predated the raid, which decimated its\\nworkforce.\\n\\nthe bank asked the judge to appoint a receiver immediately,\\nsaying that a bank representative had been expelled from the\\npostville plant after a meeting on thursday. the judge, linda r.\\nreade of u.s. district court, appointed the temporary receiver late\\nfriday and set a hearing for wednesday.\\n\\nthe bank reported that agriprocessors owed $188,000

\"are in\\ndanger of starving to death if not fed.\"\\n\\naaron rubashkin, the company\\'s owner and the father of sholom,\\nput up $2.2 million in collateral, in addition to some of the\\nproperty at

the\\nhistory every bit as seriously as the art, if not more so, died\\noct. 18 in los angeles. he was 75 and a longtime los angeles\\nresident.\\n\\nthe cause was myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, his wife,\\nmyra, said. at his death, he was a professor of art history at the\\nuniversity of california, los angeles, where he had taught for\\nthree decades.\\n\\nin nearly 20 books and scores of articles, boime explored the\\nsocial and political contexts in which art is produced. his work\\ndid not neglect issues of style and form, the traditional province\\nof art criticism. but it focused on art as a cultural product -- for\\ngood or ill -- of the society in which it is made. he also sought to\\nrehabilitate one of the most famous madmen of western art.\\n\\ntraining marxist and psychoanalytic lenses on his subjects,\\nboime examined artworks as physical manifestations of the\\neconomics, class divisions, power structure and racial attitudes of\\ntheir times. he was best known for his studies of 19th-century\\neuropean art, but his work ranged over many genres, among them\\npopular imagery in europe and america and emblematic national\\nmonuments like the statue of liberty and mount rushmore.\\n\\nboime was known in particular for his four-volume \"social\\nhistory of modern art.\" published by the university of chicago\\npress, the series spans nearly 3,000 pages and comprises \"art in\\nan age of revolution, 1750-1800\" (1987); \"art in an age of\\nbonapartism, 1800-1815\" (1990); \"art in an age of\\ncounterrevolution, 1815-1848\" (2004); and \"art in an age of civil\\nstruggle, 1848-1871\" (2007).\\n\\nwhile some critics found boime\\'s work polemical, others praised\\nthe sweep of his scholarship. writing in the new york times in\\n1974, hilton kramer singled out boime\\'s first book, \"the academy\\nand french painting in the nineteenth century,\" as \"the\\nindispensable text for this inquiry.\" published by phaidon in\\n1971, the book examines the unintended contribution of the french\\nacademy, long considered a conservative force in the training of\\n19th-century painters, to artistic innovation.\\n\\nalbert isaac boime was born in st. louis on march 17, 1933.\\nafter army service, he earned a bachelor\\'s degree in art history\\nfrom ucla in 1961, followed by master\\'s and doctoral degrees in the\\nfield from columbia in 1963 and 1968. from 1968 to 1972 he taught\\nat what was then the state university of new york at stony brook\\n(it is now stony brook university); from 1972 to 1978 he taught at\\nsuny binghamton. he joined the ucla faculty in 1979.\\n\\nbesides his wife, the former myra block, boime is survived by a\\nbrother, irving, of st. louis; two sons, eric, of minneapolis, and\\nrobert, of portland, ore.; and five grandchildren.\\n\\nboime was often drawn to outsiders, as both the subjects and the\\nmakers of art. in one book, \"the art of exclusion\" (smithsonian\\ninstitution, 1990), he examined the depiction of black people in\\n19th-century art. in another, \"thomas couture and the eclectic\\nvision\" (yale university, 1980), he explored the life and work of\\ncouture, a significant but neglected french painter of the 19th\\ncentury.\\n\\nbut in one study, which attracted wide attention in the news\\nmedia, boime offered a new interpretation of a well-known painting\\nby a well-known artist. with a planetarium put at his disposal, he\\nreconstructed the sky over saint-remy, france, as van gogh would\\nhave seen it in from the window of the asylum to which he was\\nconfined in 1889 and 1890.\\n\\naddressing the american astronomical society in 1985, boime\\nargued that van gogh\\'s masterwork, \"the starry night,\" was not\\nthe hallucinatory vision of a madman, as observers had long\\nsupposed. instead, he said, the painting\\'s outlandish whorls\\naccurately if somewhat fancifully depicted the arrangement of the\\nheavenly bodies in the predawn hours of june 19, 1889, the day van\\ngogh finished the painting.\\n\\nwhen coal powered the tugboats of cornell steamboat co., people\\nwho lived along the hudson river would recognize them by the yellow\\nand black of their smokestacks and the blare of their whistles. in\\nthe decades after the civil war, cornell pulled the barges that\\nbrought the bluestone, cement and bricks to build new york city,\\nand the grain and ice to sustain it. baled hay came down the river\\nfor the thousands of horses on city streets, and their manure went\\nnorth for fertilizer.\\n\\nclarence w. spangenberger -- who died oct. 21 in rhinebeck, n.y.,\\nat the age of 102 -- was the last president of what for many years,\\nwith its more than 60 vessels, was the largest tugboat company in\\nthe united states, and maybe the biggest in the world.\\n\\nhis death was announced by stuart murray, author of \"thomas\\ncornell and the cornell steamboat company\" (2001).\\n\\nby the time spangenberger took over the legendary company in\\n1954, cornell was struggling; trucks, railroads and oceangoing\\nvessels were fast cutting into its business. spangenberger, known\\nas bill, did everything he could to stave off a collapse, including\\nlaying off hundreds of employees, many of whom he had known since\\nchildhood -- always telling them in person. he even had to let his\\nfather, the company barber, go.\\n\\nafter its largest customer, new york trap rock corp., a producer\\nof crushed stone, bought cornell in 1958, spangenberger remained in\\ncharge of towing operations, which continued to be called cornell\\nsteamboat. but his economies and the introduction of powerful new\\nkinds of tugboats were not enough to prevent cornell from going out\\nof business in 1963.\\n\\nthe company traced it roots to the 1830s, when thomas cornell\\nacquired a sloop to carry passengers and ship goods from rondout,\\nn.y., a port town on the hudson that is now part of kingston, to\\nnew york city, 100 miles to the south.\\n\\nbut he glimpsed that steamboats were the wave of the future and\\nset about building a fleet of towing paddle-wheelers that by 1900\\nwas the largest of its kind in the united states. one steamer was\\nthe famous norwich, which was designed by robert fulton and\\noperated until 1910.\\n\\ncornell\\'s business empire included hotels, railroads and an\\namusement park. when he died in 1890, samuel d. coykendall took\\nover and converted the cornell fleet to propeller-driven tugboats.\\nhis six sons assumed control after his death in 1913.\\n\\nspangenberger was born in kingston on dec. 9, 1905. he was the\\nonly child of parents who supported themselves by catering to the\\nshipyard workers and boatmen in rondout, his mother by selling\\nbread from her parents\\' bakery, and his father by working as a\\nbarber to the coykendall family and to company executives.\\n\\nspangenberger graduated from new york university with a degree\\nin business, then worked for standard oil co. as a sales\\nrepresentative. he joined cornell in 1933 in accounts receivable,\\nthen moved to supervising the engineers, firemen and oilers of the\\ntugs before climbing the ladder to become president in 1954.\\n\\nby that time, much of cornell\\'s business had disappeared. the\\nhudson had been deepened around 1930 to allow oceangoing ships to\\nreach albany, ending the need to tow grain barges. railroads and\\ntrucks could carry most cargo faster and more efficiently than\\nboats, and refrigeration had obviated the need for natural ice. and\\ncornell had not gone after the lucrative business of towing\\npetroleum products.\\n\\nwell before he became president of cornell steamboat,\\nspangenberger had nudged the company\\'s reluctant owners to convert\\nsteam vessels to oil power. his efforts to modernize the fleet\\nresulted in boats like the rockland county, which could push 21\\nbarges that were tied three abreast and covered an acre. before\\nthen, when barges were towed end to end, they would have extended a\\nhalf mile, murray said.\\n\\ntrap rock, whose corporate predecessors dated to before the\\ncivil war, hoped to use cornell\\'s name, spangenberger\\'s expertise\\nand $4 million in new barges to expand its tug and barge business.\\nbut when sufficient business failed to materialize, trap rock sold\\nits barges and boats and got out of the business in 1963.\\n\\nspangenberger, who left no immediate survivors, liked to hike in\\nthe catskills and dance to the music of guy lombardo in elegant\\nmanhattan hotels with his wife of more than 70 years, the former\\nkathleen m. sharp, who died last year. he played tennis into his\\nearly 90s.\\n\\nhe worked to keep alive the memory of the steamboat company. he\\nhelped to get the company biography published and to organize an\\nexhibit about cornell steamboat at the hudson river maritime museum\\nin 2001.\\n\\nin 1958, spangenberger, with clear delight, showed a reporter\\nfor the new york times some yellowed articles about the company,\\nincluding one from the 1880s that reported that it had cost a\\nshipper a dime a ton to move cargo from new york city to yonkers,\\nand twice that if the destination was poughkeepsie.\\n\\nsuper bowl champions get celebrity\\ntreatment. for amani toomer of the giants, this meant an invitation\\nto the television talk show \"the view.\"\\n\\nsuch moments can also be humbling. whoopi goldberg mistakenly\\npraised toomer for the spectacular super bowl catch that was made\\nby david tyree. but toomer let the gaffe pass so as not to\\nembarrass her. \"i let her off the hook,\" he said.\\n\\nin a way, the moment suited the understated professional persona\\nof toomer, the senior giant, who will enter sunday\\'s game against\\nthe dallas cowboys at giants stadium with several franchise\\npass-catching records, including most receptions (642) and most\\nyards (9,194).\\n\\ndespite his longevity and accomplishments, toomer -- in his 13th\\nseason -- has never made the pro bowl. it was not until this season\\nthat he was elected by his teammates as one of five captains.\\n\\n\"i haven\\'t been a captain since high school because i\\'m kind of\\nquiet, and i don\\'t really say too much,\" toomer said. \"i thought\\nit was pretty special. they recognized the hard work i\\'ve done.\"\\n\\ntoomer, playing a position occasionally filled by outspoken\\negotists, sometimes comes across as reticent. but he was one of the\\nfew giants to publicly discuss the recent problems involving\\nplaxico burress.\\n\\ntoomer said last week that burress -- suspended for a game\\nearlier this season and benched for a quarter last sunday -- had\\nbecome a distraction. \"it\\'s not good for the team,\" toomer said,\\n\"and it\\'s not good for him.\"\\n\\nthey play similar roles and share playing time, so the situation\\ncould be sensitive. toomer said he did not confront burress. but he\\nfelt obligated to answer questions; it is what a captain does.\\n\\nas is usually the case among athletes, credibility in the locker\\nroom is earned primarily by performance on the field. toomer\\naccrued more last sunday in pittsburgh with the giants trailing by\\n5 points in the fourth quarter on a fourth-and-6 play.\\n\\nwith a move around a cornerback, he got open deep. with a\\nlast-moment dive, he caught eli manning\\'s pass for a 30-yard gain\\nwhile eluding a safety\\'s helmet-first tackle. the reception kept\\nalive a drive that helped lead to a 21-14 victory.\\n\\nkevin gilbride, the offensive coordinator, said the catch was\\n\"huge.\"\\n\\n\"somebody had to step up and make a big play,\" he said.\\ngilbride also praised toomer for \"the courage he displays.\"\\n\\ntwo days later, on his day off, toomer was in a limousine in\\nhillsdale, n.j., picking up chase strynkowski, a sixth grader at\\ngeorge white middle school. it was part of the nfl\\'s take a player\\nto school promotion to encourage physical fitness.\\n\\ntoomer ate breakfast with strynkowski\\'s family, teased chase\\nlightly about his new england patriots souvenirs and rode with him\\nto school in the limo. when they entered the principal\\'s office,\\ntoomer removed his hat.\\n\\n\"can\\'t wear hats in school,\" toomer said. \"my dad was\\nactually the principal at my school. i was the principal\\'s son.\\nthink about that.\"\\n\\nthat was in northern california, where the four toomer siblings\\nwere raised in a suburban neighborhood with a view of the golden\\ngate bridge. his parents had named him amani askari because the\\nwords mean peace warrior in swahili.\\n\\namani first attended private schools but his father, donald\\ntoomer, was in charge of an inner-city junior high in san\\nfrancisco. according to donald, he decided to enroll amani in his\\nschool when his son said to him at a young age, \"dad, i don\\'t like\\nblack dudes.\"\\n\\n\"i said, \\'what?\"\\' donald toomer recalled. \"i said, \\'well,\\nwhat do you think i am?\"\\'\\n\\nthe elder toomer, speaking in a telephone interview, said he\\ngrew up as one of 13 children in what he called a ghetto in akron,\\nohio. he said his mother was a domestic worker.\\n\\nthe elder toomer said his son required cultural orientation\\nabout his race. \"i needed him to go to a public school, an\\ninner-city school, to see how other people -- people of color -- had\\nto act and react,\" he said. \"i wanted him to understand everyone\\nisn\\'t as fortunate.\"\\n\\ndonald toomer also said he taught his son to be more aware of\\nothers. \"respect yourself and go out of your way to be aware of\\nothers, especially the little kids,\" he said.\\n\\namani excelled at his father\\'s junior high, moved on to a\\nprivate high school, was recruited by michigan and was drafted by\\nthe giants.\\n\\nhis father, who played for woody hayes at ohio state, used to\\nofficiate pac-10 games and still operates a scoreboard clock for\\noakland raiders games. so he had connections.\\n\\nas a teenager, amani toomer studied under jerry rice, the star\\nof the san francisco 49ers. but he had difficult adjustments to\\nboth college and professional football.\\n\\nin his freshman year at michigan, he called his father and said\\nhe wanted to transfer. \"he said, \\'dad, they don\\'t like me,\"\\'\\ndonald recalled. \"\\'they chased me out of the varsity room.\"\\'\\n\\nin his rookie year with the giants, toomer called his\\nhigh-school coach on the telephone and said, \"coach, they think\\ni\\'m a space cadet.\" his second giants coach, jim fassel, scolded\\nhim for poor training habits.\\n\\ntoomer got more serious, mastered kung fu, studied yoga and\\nevolved into something more than a kick returner. now, he mentors\\nplayers like mario manningham, a rookie receiver from michigan who\\nhas the locker next to toomer\\'s.\\n\\n\"he has been showing me the ropes,\" manningham said. \"he\\nleads by example.\" down the row, the second-year receiver steve\\nsmith said: \"he tells you to stay patient. your time\\'s going to\\ncome.\"\\n\\nsmith smiled and tapped a shelf on his locker. \"we respect\\nhim,\" smith said. \"he\\'s been here longer than some of the wood in\\nthis room.\" toomer is 34 years old. manningham is 22; smith, 23.\\n\\non tuesday, toomer stood with 11-year old chase strynkowski in\\nfront of his gym class in northern jersey, leading stretches and\\nexercises and telling the children to work out for at least one\\nhour each day.\\n\\n\"be

most\\nimportant game since they lost in the first round of the playoffs\\nin 2006.\\n\\nof course, getting the jets to acknowledge the additional\\nimportance of any game is almost impossible, a violation of coach\\neric mangini\\'s every-game-counts-the-same philosophy. yet last\\nweek, several players for the jets (4-3) used the word \"big\" to\\ndescribe their american football conference east game against the\\nbills (5-2).\\n\\neven mangini allowed this much: \"we\\'ve definitely talked about\\nthe fact that if you want to move forward, you have to win these\\ndivision games.\"\\n\\nwhen the jets made deals worth more than $100 million in the\\noff-season on free agents, and traded for quarterback brett favre\\nand nose tackle kris jenkins, they did so with the intention of\\nwinning games like this one.\\n\\nseven games into their grand roster experiment, the jets still\\nhave no idea what type of team they are. sometimes, their running\\ngame is effective. other times, it goes nowhere.\\n\\nsometimes, their passing game is unstoppable, as it was against\\nthe arizona cardinals when favre threw six touchdown passes. other\\ntimes, it is erratic as it was in the jets\\' past three games, when\\nfavre threw for a combined seven interceptions and three touchdown\\npasses. in those games, the jets had a 2-1 record with a minus-8\\nturnover ratio while playing against the cincinnati bengals, the\\noakland raiders and the kansas city chiefs. they have a combined\\n4-17 record.\\n\\nthe defense has also been inconsistent. in a microcosm of their\\nseason, the jets shut out the cardinals in the first half but gave\\nup 35 points in the second.\\n\\ndespite their uneven play and their loss to the raiders, the\\njets are in the thick of the east race, trailing the division\\nleaders buffalo and new england by a game.\\n\\nafter watching the bills on tape, favre said their record was\\nnot a fluke. he added that a win over the bills would give the jets\\na feeling of \"o.k., we could be pretty good.\"\\n\\n\"it will do a lot for our psyche and character, but i don\\'t\\nknow if it will put us over the hump,\" favre said. \"we have to\\nget over that hump, and if we can do that, you know, it will be\\ninteresting.\"\\n\\nentering this season, bills coach dick jauron said he felt each\\nteam in the east had improved. with patriots quarterback tom brady\\nout for the season, that improvement means the division is wide\\nopen -- only two games separate the bills and last-place miami. the\\nbills lost to the dolphins last week. jauron acknowledged that each\\nweek, coaches say they prepare the same way, but he added that a\\ndivision game with the playoff implications of this one was\\n\"emotionally, a little bit different.\"\\n\\n\"there is a little more bounce,\" jauron said. \"i don\\'t know\\nhow else to define it. it\\'s not in terms of hours of preparation,\\nor effort on the field at practice. there is just a difference in\\nfeeling when you\\'re inside that division.\"\\n\\ndivision aside, the jets enter this game tied for the second\\nwild-card slot in the afc. they face a bills team that has won the\\nlast three games in this series, despite entering each contest with\\na losing record. they will face quarterback trent edwards, who made\\nthe first start of his career last season against the jets and has\\nbeen on a roll lately. and they will face the bills\\' rowdy home\\ncrowd at a stadium where buffalo is unbeaten in three games.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know yet,\" edwards said when asked if the bills had\\narrived. \"we have probably won some games that we should have\\nlost, but we lost some games that we should have won. once week 17\\ncomes around, we\\'ll have a better feel for whether or not we\\'re an\\nelite team.\"\\n\\nedwards lauded the afc east as one of the toughest divisions in\\nthe nfl, although its teams have benefited this season from a full\\nslate of games against the afc and nfc west, which are generally\\nregarded as two of the worst divisions in the league.\\n\\nthe bills have emerged as a contender largely because of an\\noffense that has been together for a while.\\n\\n\"i have a better comfort level with this offense and with these\\nguys in the huddle,\" edwards said. \"they\\'re not new faces. it\\'s\\nthe same guys from last year. it\\'s the same offense as last year,\\nand it\\'s the same coaches as last year.\"\\n\\nthe jets took the opposite approach, adding favre, left guard\\nalan faneca, right tackle damien woody and fullback tony\\nrichardson. the results have been mixed, particularly in the past\\nthree games.\\n\\nthe next part of their schedule seems difficult: st. louis, at\\nnew england, at tennessee, and denver.\\n\\n\"regardless of what\\'s being said externally, if you buy into\\nthat, if you look at that, if you think about that, you lose track\\nof what\\'s important,\" mangini said. \"it happens all the time.\\nteams that are favored to win, don\\'t. teams that aren\\'t favored to\\nwin, do.\"\\n\\nthe jets hope that trend continues sunday.\\n\\nthe bright lights of the big city are getting a\\nlittle bit duller -- with just a hint of green.\\n\\nmotion sensors ensure that unoccupied offices, storerooms and\\ncanteens go dark after workers and cleaning crews leave at night.\\ndimmers soften overhead lights that once could burn only bright or\\nnot at all. timers guarantee that buildings fade to black while the\\ncity sleeps.\\n\\ngone are the days when cheap electricity, primitive lighting\\ntechnology and landlords\\' desire to showcase their skyscrapers kept\\nfloor after floor of the city\\'s highest towers glowing into the\\nnight. rising energy costs, conservationism, stricter building\\ncodes and sophisticated lighting systems have conspired to slowly,\\noften imperceptibly, transform manhattan\\'s venerable nightscape\\ninto one with a gentler glow.\\n\\ninstead of tower after tower shining at all hours -- the world\\ntrade center stayed aglow long after its occupants went home -- the\\nskyline is becoming a patchwork of sparsely sparkling buildings\\ndecorated with ornamentally lighted tops.\\n\\n\"the tall tower with the illuminated floors on all night long\\nis probably a thing of the past,\" said randy sabedra, the owner of\\nrs lighting design, who is helping to create a new map of the\\ncity\\'s most prominently lighted buildings. \"you\\'re not relying on\\nthe glowing floors to have the building presence. it is relying on\\nthe crown of light.\"\\n\\nsince electricity set it ablaze more than a century ago, the\\nskyline has dimmed a number of times. during world war ii and the\\nenergy crisis of the 1970s, new yorkers considered it patriotic to\\nturn out lights. but such frugality disappeared once times were\\nflush again.\\n\\nthe building boom of the last decade, the ever-expanding\\nelectronic billboards of times square and unshielded traffic lights\\nhave solidified new york\\'s status as one of the country\\'s most\\nlight-polluted cities, according to the international dark-sky\\nassociation, which has pushed for city and state legislation to\\nturn the lights down.\\n\\nnew york scores a 9 on the 9-point bortle dark-sky scale, the\\nassociation\\'s favored measure, along with other major cities like\\nhouston and las vegas; a typical suburban sky ranks a 5, while\\ntucson, which has stringent outdoor lighting codes, is also a 5.\\n\\n\"the light bulb has not really gone on in their head yet,\"\\nsusan harder, who runs the association\\'s new york section, said of\\ncity officials. \"we\\'ll always have an iconic skyline, but we don\\'t\\nneed this big glow over the city.\"\\n\\nto that end, the state assembly passed legislation in june\\nrequiring that new outdoor lighting have shields that reduce glare\\nand waste; the bill\\'s sponsor, assemblywoman linda b. rosenthal, a\\nmanhattan democrat, said it would most likely be taken up by the\\nstate senate if the democrats manage to win a majority on tuesday\\n(republicans currently hold a one-seat advantage).\\n\\ncity councilman alan j. gerson has introduced a variety of\\nsimilar measures -- to require full streetlight shields and motion\\ndetectors in all commercial and government buildings, and to\\nmandate more efficiently lighted billboards. the first of the\\nproposals could be taken up as early as this month.\\n\\n\"the sky won\\'t be totally dark,\" rosenthal said. \"but it\\'s\\n2008, so we have to take into account energy concerns.\"\\n\\nin many ways, the business community is ahead of the\\npoliticians. several of the city\\'s newest skyscrapers incorporate\\ncutting-edge technologies that appeal to environmentalists -- and\\nthose eager to keep energy costs down.\\n\\n\"this time, the difference is that we\\'re more conscious of what\\nwe\\'re doing and the lighting industry is more advanced,\" said meg\\nsmith, a manager in new york for lightolier, a manufacturer that\\nspecializes in lighting fixtures and controls.\\n\\nas demand for electricity in new york rises and global\\ncompetition drives energy prices higher, the cost of the technology\\nthat makes better use of daylight and reduces electricity use at\\nnight -- motion sensors, software-driven timers and the like -- is\\nfalling. in some cases, it takes just two years to recoup the\\ninvestment in this equipment, down from five years not long ago,\\naccording to mark roush, director of new york marketing for acuity\\nbrands lighting, the nation\\'s largest maker of lighting fixtures.\\n\\nthat includes the growing number of rebates from state agencies\\nand utilities, which are trying to reduce consumption to relieve\\nstress on the electric grid and put off building expensive power\\nplants and substations.\\n\\nat the new 91,000-square-foot downtown offices of incisive\\nmedia, which owns about 30 publications, including the american\\nlawyer magazine, the two floors are divided into four zones for\\noverhead lighting so not all of the space has to be lighted or dark\\nat a given time. individual offices are equipped with motion\\nsensors; on a recent evening, lights automatically shut off as\\nworkers left for the day. the cleaning crew was gone by 8 p.m., but\\nbecause a handful of editors worked later, a timer turned off the\\nremaining lights at 11 -- and would turn them back on at 6 a.m.\\n\\n\"we have to balance the administrative time versus the energy\\nsavings,\" said allison hoffman, an incisive media executive who\\noversaw the construction of the space, at 120 broadway. \"we\\'ll be\\nconstantly adjusting.\"\\n\\nto qualify for tax credits and rebates from the state energy\\nresearch and development authority, incisive\\'s architects, tpg,\\ndesigned a system that emits less than 0.78 watt a square foot (1.1\\nwatts a square foot are allowed under the building code for\\nrefurbished offices). they used fluorescent bulbs that are\\nfive-eighths of an inch in diameter, about 40 percent smaller than\\nthe previous generation of bulbs, and use 28 watts of electricity,\\ncompared with 42 to 48 watts for the old lights.\\n\\nat the national audubon society\\'s offices on houston and varick\\nstreets, lights-out is set for 7 p.m. ten minutes before, a warning\\nflash alerts employees needing to work late that they should go to\\na light switch to reset the timers.\\n\\nclay nessler, vice president of global energy and sustainability\\nat johnson controls, helped develop a more complex system for the\\ncitigroup tower in long island city, queens, that helps keep\\ncleaning crews on schedule. \"it\\'s going to increase productivity\\nand lead to more efficiency,\" he said.\\n\\nat the renzo piano-designed new headquarters of the new york\\ntimes, on eighth avenue, the rows of single 28-watt fluorescent\\nbulbs that line the ceilings are connected to a computer network\\nthat lets maintenance workers quickly scan which ones need\\nreplacing or repair, rather than trolling the floors.\\n\\nlike incisive media, the associated press divided its manhattan\\nheadquarters, which covers two acres of floor space, into zones,\\nallowing groups of workers to tailor the lights to their liking and\\npreventing large banks from burning when just a handful of people\\nare around. the system, lightolier\\'s igen, helped cut energy use by\\n28 percent in the first year, smith said.\\n\\nbecause of the expense, advanced lighting systems are being\\ninstalled primarily in new buildings or offices being retrofitted\\nfor new tenants. so changes to the city\\'s nightscape will come\\ngradually over many years.\\n\\nbut more and more, building owners are writing leases that\\nrequire tenants to pay for their own electricity, leading many\\ntenants to install more efficient lights. a lot of the new\\nenergy-efficient fixtures were designed to fit into the ceiling\\nspaces that now hold older fixtures, making the upgrades easier and\\ncheaper.\\n\\n\"lights will diminish,\" said guy geier, senior partner at\\nfxfowle, an architecture and interior design firm in manhattan,\\n\"because over 10 or 20 years, those leases are going to roll over\\nand the incentive is going to be there to start installing newer\\nlights.\"\\n\\nthis is not the first time innovations in technology and\\nconstruction have been visible in the nightscape. in the early 20th\\ncentury, many buildings lacked air-conditioners, so they were\\ndesigned to have most workers sitting near windows; that meant the\\nyellowish light from the incandescent bulbs hanging above their\\ndesks flooded through open windows into the street.\\n\\nas central air-conditioning and fluorescent lights spread after\\nworld war ii, architects could build skyscrapers enclosed in glass,\\nwhich gave off a cooler light; at the same time, more interior\\nspace was now viable, though lights there were less visible from\\nthe outside. but as tall towers multiplied, the volume of light in\\nmanhattan increased: many buildings had only a few light switches\\non each floor, so if even one person was in the office, large\\nswaths were aglow.\\n\\njames sanders, who used to work for the port authority of new\\nyork and new jersey, recalled arriving at work one sunday in 1985,\\nfinding only two switches on the entire 84th floor of one of the\\nworld trade center towers, and discovering that a janitor had to be\\ncalled to flip one.\\n\\n\"they had to switch a half-acre of lights on just for me,\" he\\nsaid. to his bosses, who were the landlords, leaving lights on all\\nevening \"was in part a symbol of power,\" he said. these days,\\nsuch landlords can light perimeter offices while keeping the center\\nof a building dark. others are installing more efficient led lights\\noutside buildings in place of older floodlights. still others are\\nfocusing on the tops of their towers, joining the empire state\\nbuilding, whose color-coded homages are a new york icon.\\n\\ncon edison itself has adopted several of these techniques at its\\n26-story headquarters near union square, installing 344 led\\nfixtures on the clock tower in september. the fixtures, which are\\nmeant to last 15 years, use 63 percent less energy than\\nconventional lights, and can be programmed to produce millions of\\ncolors without the need for filters (like those used at the empire\\nstate) or other equipment.\\n\\nsuch ornamental statements will most likely become more\\nprominent as the interiors of buildings continue to dim over time.\\n\\n\"new york city\\'s skyline will always be a magical thing,\" said\\nsabedra, the lighting designer at work on the nightscape map.\\n\"it\\'s something wonderful and beautiful about the city when it\\ntransforms at night, its building glow, its glowing canyons. it\\'s a\\nwonderful sight.\"\\n\\nuntil recently, few people would have thought felipe massa, a\\nsmall, modest brazilian, would be challenging for the formula one\\ntitle at the brazilian grand prix on sunday in the last race of the\\nseason.\\n\\nmassa trails the series leader, lewis hamilton of mclaren\\nmercedes, by 7 points and will need as much luck as his ferrari\\nteammate kimi raikkonen had last year when he won the race and the\\nchampionship by a point. but massa, a winner of five races this\\nseason, said that did not worry him.\\n\\n\"i have zero pressure, because i have nothing to lose,\" he\\nsaid. \"the only thing i am thinking about is winning. after that,\\nthe matter is not in my hands.\"\\n\\nbut massa did take a step toward making his task easier on\\nsaturday. he delighted tens of thousands of fans packing his home\\ncountry\\'s 2.6-mile interlagos track by winning the pole for the\\nrace with a time of 1 minute 12.368 seconds in his ferrari.\\n\\nnow he needs to win and have hamilton finish sixth or lower.\\n\\nferrari, for its part, seems to have always believed in him. he\\nsigned with ferrari in 2002, four years before he drove for the\\nteam. it is the only such contract ferrari has given a young\\ndriver.\\n\\nanother who believed in him early on was peter sauber, the\\nfounder of the sauber team, who was the first to hire massa and\\nraikkonen. in raikkonen, sauber saw formidable mental strength; in\\nmassa, he was impressed by his natural abilities.\\n\\nit has taken the 27-year-old massa years to build his mental\\nstrength and racing craft. but he is one of the most complete\\ndrivers in the series, and he has almost lived down his first-year\\nreputation as an erratic, unstable driver. he was 20 when he began\\nwith sauber in 2002, and he had repeated errors and accidents.\\n\\n\"my first year, i was really a kind of a wild guy,\" massa\\nsaid. \"but i had a very difficult car to drive and i was very\\nyoung. i think i was maybe too young to have started straight\\naway.\"\\n\\nhis rise to the top happened quickly. massa had just won the\\nitalian and european formula renault titles and was about to join\\nthe formula 3000 euro series in italy when he met with jean todt,\\nthe ferrari director.\\n\\n\"the only thing he said is that he had heard about me, and he\\nsaid i need to win the f3000 championship first,\" massa said.\\n\\nhe won it and todt signed him to a contract from 2002 through\\n2008. that deal was later extended through 2010. but massa did not\\nrace for ferrari until 2006; he still had much to learn.\\n\\nafter his troubled first year with sauber, massa took 2003 off\\nto test drive for ferrari, hoping to improve his technical skills,\\nconfidence and team relations.\\n\\n\"if you know how to set up the car, if you know how to work\\nwith the team, you know what you need to have a comfortable car to\\ndrive,\" he said. \"that was a big learning experience when i was a\\nferrari test driver.\"\\n\\nreturning to sauber in 2004, massa was indeed a better driver,\\nscoring 12 points that year and 11 points in 2005.\\n\\nin 2006, he joined michael schumacher at ferrari and quickly\\nproved to be as fast as him. massa got his first victory, at the\\nturkish grand prix. he also learned from schumacher.\\n\\n\"the way he works as a leader, i think that\\'s very important\\nfor you to grow inside the team, to work with the team and to say\\nexactly what you want, to push hard in every area,\" massa said.\\n\\nlast year, his first without schumacher, was crucial. ferrari\\nhad invested heavily in raikkonen, who was expected to lead the\\nteam.\\n\\nbut massa challenged for the title up to the fourth-to-last\\nrace, the italian grand prix at monza, in a battle between him,\\nraikkonen and hamilton.\\n\\nafter massa dropped out of the monza race with a broken\\nsuspension, ferrari decided he should support raikkonen, even\\nthough massa had a mathematical chance to win the title.\\n\\n\"i was 3 points behind kimi,\" he said. \"but the difference\\nwas compared to the first. so if they put me still in the position\\nto be able to win the championship, we were not going to be\\nchampions, because kimi won by only 1 point. it was the right\\ndecision.\"\\n\\neven so, massa said it was difficult to accept, and it became\\neven more difficult in the last race, massa\\'s home race. as with\\nmassa and hamilton this weekend, hamilton and raikkonen were\\nseparated by 7 points. massa had been the fastest all weekend in\\ns?o paulo, but he was forced to give up the lead to help raikkonen\\nwin the title.\\n\\nhe did so ungrudgingly, and raikkonen made it clear that it was\\nthanks to massa that he won the title.\\n\\n\"we were not really racing against each other, so a big thanks\\nto the team, a big thanks to felipe,\" raikkonen said after the\\nrace.\\n\\nin 2008, many expected raikkonen to be even stronger. he won the\\nsecond race of the season and massa failed to score points in\\neither the first or the second race. but massa won the third race,\\nthe bahrain grand prix, finished second in spain, won in turkey and\\nfinished third in monaco. he has been consistent ever since,\\nwinning a total of five races.\\n\\nbut he also gained 7 points because of penalties against\\nhamilton and another driver. one of those penalties resulted in\\nmassa\\'s inheriting the victory in belgium after the race was over\\nand he had crossed the finish line in second.\\n\\nhis quiet confidence is often misinterpreted by his critics as\\nweakness. but he said that the low expectations made his good\\nresults all the sweeter.\\n\\n\"people always put me completely out of the game, and that\\'s\\neven nicer because nobody expects you to do a good job and then you\\ndo a better job than everybody thinks and it\\'s nicer,\" massa said.\\n\\nby the time polls open tuesday morning, officials predict that\\nas many as 35 percent of florida voters already will have cast\\nballots via early voting or absentee ballot.\\n\\ngood thing.\\n\\nthat\\'s nearly 4-million people who can stay away while the rest\\nof the state\\'s nov. 4 electorate  an estimated 5.6-million people\\nvotes the old-fashioned way: at the precinct polling place.\\n\\nearly and absentee voters have relieved pressure on polling\\nplaces in advance of what many say will be a monumental turnout.\\nbut a times analysis indicates that it won\\'t be enough to reduce\\nlong lines on election day if projections hold true.\\n\\nthe numbers of new registered voters are so large (more than\\n1-million this year) and the expected total turnout for the\\nelection is so high (85 percent of 11.2-million registered voters)\\nthat traffic in florida polling places still will be heavier than\\nit was in 2004.\\n\\nin addition, most florida voters will be using optical scan\\nballots for the first time, and election officials expect it to\\ntake them longer to vote on the new system than it did on the old\\ntouch screen machines.\\n\\nall signs point to longer lines than in 2004, when many people\\nwaited an hour or more to vote.\\n\\n\"imagine if early voting wasn\\'t there,\" said sean greene, a\\nmanager for electionline.org, an election information project of\\nthe pew center on the states.\\n\\nthe average florida polling place saw 718 voters on election day\\n2004. that\\'s 60 voters an hour. if turnout projections hold true\\nfor tuesday, the average precinct could see 810 voters, or 67\\nvoters an hour.\\n\\nin pinellas, an average of 72 voters an hour could go through\\neach precinct, an increase of six over 2004. hillsborough\\'s\\nper-precinct traffic stands to increase to 77 voters an hour, up\\nfour voters over 2004.\\n\\nin miami-dade county, where there are fewer precincts per voter,\\nthe traffic could increase by 20 voters an hour.\\n\\n\"there\\'s an energy and an excitement and an interest that i\\nhave not seen in my 31 years doing this,\" said pinellas supervisor\\nof elections deborah clark. \"voters are generally excited about a\\npresidential election but this is off the charts.\"\\n\\nexperts credit big issues and the prospect of electing the first\\nafrican-american president or the first female vice president.\\n\\nhow you react to the coming onslaught depends on your outlook.\\nsome voting advocates, wary of scaring people away from the polls,\\nsay long waits are not optimal but that\\'s the

that\\'s a headache i want.\"\\n\\njudith browne-dianis, co-director of the advancement project, a\\nvoter advocacy group, is less optimistic.\\n\\n\"we are not prepared for that level of engagement in our\\ndemocracy,\" she said. \"these waits in line are serious because\\nsome voters do not have the opportunity to wait.\"\\n\\nshe criticized elections officials in other states who have made\\nlight of the long lines by comparing them to waiting to buy coffee\\nat starbucks or queuing up for a roller-coaster ride.\\n\\n\"voting is a right,\" browne-dianis said. \"the fact that\\nthey\\'re excusing their failure to prepare for this election is\\ninexcusable.\"\\n\\never since florida\\'s famously flawed recount in 2000, elections\\nhave been under a microscope. the

supervisors, florida secretary of state\\nkurt browning said there was no law requiring people to vote in a\\nprivacy booth. if the booths are full, he said, why not set out\\nsome tables?\\n\\nwith so many people watching the process now, it\\'s more likely\\nthat problems that once went unnoticed will be caught before the\\nelection, said greene. \"there\\'s always the chance that it\\'ll be\\nfine.\"\\n\\ntimes staff writer craig pittman contributed to this report.\\n\\nin case you missed it, barack obama wins the white house if he\\nwins florida. two days to go. where\\'s florida tilting?\\n\\nfirst stipulate that democrats would be fools to underestimate\\nthe gop turnout machine in this state, as some seem to be doing.\\nflorida republicans  take a bow, former state chairman tom slade\\npractically invented the intensely targeted voter mobilization\\nprogram eventually fine tuned and enhanced by karl rove.\\n\\nevery cycle, their technology and microtargeting only improve.\\nwe also hear plenty of anecdotal evidence that the combination of\\nexcitement over sarah palin and fear of obama has the gop base at\\nleast as energized as it\\'s ever been.\\n\\nat this point in 2004, the rolling average of polls compiled by\\nrealclearpolitics.com showed president bush leading florida by 0.6\\npercent. bush wound up winning by 5 percentage points, despite an\\nunprecedented voter mobilization effort by independently operating\\ndemocratic groups. as of saturday, the average of recent polls\\nshowed obama leading by 4.1 percent.\\n\\nlet\\'s also stipulate that florida has never in modern history\\nseen a campaign like obama\\'s  not only dominating the airwaves for\\nmonths, but also methodically organizing every crevice of the state\\nwith a vast army of volunteers and paid staffers.\\n\\n\"it\\'s organized like a highly sophisticated corporation. the\\nlevel of detail to which things are conducted and the discipline to\\nensure that detail is followed is phenomenal,\" said former florida\\nsen. bob graham.\\n\\nearly voting is also changing the equation. bush won florida by\\n381,000 votes in 2004, and the gop\\'s long-standing program of\\npromoting mail-in absentee ballot voting ensured that when election\\nday arrived, about 150,000 more republicans had already cast their\\nvotes than democrats. republicans continue to beat democrats\\nsignificantly on absentee ballots, but factor in ballots cast at\\nearly voting sites, and 285,000 more democrats than republicans had\\nvoted as of saturday morning.\\n\\na key question is how many of those early voters would have\\nvoted anyway. the obama campaign estimates that 28 percent of the\\nearly votes came from floridians who rarely or never had voted. a\\nrecent st. petersburg times poll found that mccain had a 10-point\\nadvantage among people who said they intended to vote on election\\nday.\\n\\nmccain is in position to win florida. but he has some serious\\nhurdles to overcome.\\n\\nquote of the week\\n\\n\"there is no doubt in my mind that if charlie crist had been\\npicked as the vice presidential nominee, we would not be discussing\\nthe

(i would\\nhave thought it the other way around, since the designated hitter\\nobviously is a left-wing idea.)\\n\\nif obama wins, he will win in the middle  among that slice of\\namericans not wedded

frenzied, final push to turn out florida\\'s voters had stars\\npolitical and otherwise  blitzing the state saturday.\\n\\n\"get everybody in your family, anybody that can vote,\"\\ncomedian chris rock exhorted more than 1,000 people at a pro-barack\\nobama rally in the college park area of tampa. \"get your retarded\\nuncle. get him to vote. anybody you know with an arm, bring him\\ndown.\"\\n\\nforty miles north in new port richey, at least 5,500 people\\nturned out to see republican vice presidential nominee sarah palin\\nkick off a three-stop tour of central florida. and in miami and\\nwinter park, sen. hillary rodham clinton stumped for obama.\\n\\n\"remember, florida, we\\'re a nation at war. we need somebody who\\ntalks about wars that america is fighting, and isn\\'t afraid to use\\nthe word victory. we need john mccain,\" palin told the\\nenthusiastic crowd at sims park.\\n\\nearly voting ended saturday in many florida counties (except\\npinellas, where voting continues today from noon to 4 p.m.), so the\\ncampaigns are shifting their emphasis to get every possible vote\\ntuesday. polls show a tight race for florida\\'s 27 electoral votes,\\nand both sides are slicing and dicing the electorate to mobilize\\ntheir supporters.\\n\\nthat\\'s why palin was in pasco, polk city and ocala on saturday.\\nstressing familiar republican themes of limited government,\\nnational defense and, especially, taxes, she was working to help\\nwin these republican-leaning areas with similarly big margins as\\npresident bush did in 2004.\\n\\nit\\'s why rock appeared in a heavily african-american\\nneighborhood at a little league field a couple of blocks from an\\nearly voting site. and it\\'s why clinton, particularly popular with\\nhispanics, was in miami and central florida.\\n\\n\"it\\'s like we\\'ve been in a long, long race and we can see the\\nfinish line,\" she told a fired-up crowd outside old san juan\\nrestaurant in little havana. \"we can\\'t let anybody stop us or trip\\nus up or divert or distract us. we have to get across that finish\\nline. everything is at stake that we care about.\"\\n\\nvolunteers handed out stickers that read \"hispanics for\\nchange\" and arranged for buses to take people to early voting\\nsites and to canvass neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"how many of you have already voted?\" clinton said. a sea of\\nhands shot up amid a roaring cheer. \"well, here\\'s what i want you\\nto do: i want you to make the case for sen. obama, and it\\'s not\\nhard to make.?\\n\\n\"it took a democratic president to clean up after the first\\npresident bush. it\\'s going to take a democratic president to clean\\nup after this president bush.\"\\n\\nthe flood of activity continues today as former new york city\\nmayor rudy

then hold a\\nrally outside raymond james stadium in tampa later monday morning.\\nobama will campaign in jacksonville on monday.\\n\\ndave rodgers, 58, a republican from holiday at palin\\'s rally,\\ndiscounted the polls showing mccain behind obama. he said the\\nundecided voters will go for mccain because of questions over the\\neconomy and national security, and mccain\\'s experience. those\\nfactors played into his decision to back mccain after the third\\ndebate, even though he had planned to sit out the election.\\n\\n\"remember back to the 2004 election, we were behind, too,\"\\nrodgers said.\\n\\na mason-dixon poll released saturday shows a neck-and-neck race\\nin florida with obama leading mccain, 49 percent to 47 percent and\\n5 percent undecided. that means florida could come down to\\nwhichever side has the stronger voter turnout effort.\\n\\n\"i\\'m very, very worried. i have never seen people so much as\\nnow,\" said laura vianello, 59, a republican activist who was\\nwaving signs for mccain outside the cuban restaurant versailles on\\nsaturday. \"obama is much more organized, and i hate to say that\\nbecause i\\'m a republican.\"\\n\\nmany voters who turned out to see chris rock sported \"obama is\\nmy president\" t-shirts, and many of them said they already had\\nvoted. rock joked during his seven-minute routine about the\\nnumerous houses owned by the mccains and said the republican\\nnominee can\\'t relate to their lives and struggles. \"when you go to\\nsomebody for help, you want somebody who can relate to what you\\nhave to say. like if i have problems (picking up women), i wouldn\\'t\\ncall brad pitt because he wouldn\\'t know what i was talking about,\"\\nrock quipped.\\n\\nhe is hardly the only celebrity working to turn out votes in\\nflorida. comedian george lopez will be campaigning for obama in\\nmiami and tampa on monday, and the mccain campaign on saturday\\nreleased a new tv ad featuring jeb bush.\\n\\n\"the people of florida face an important choice,\" the former\\ngovernor says. \"do we elect a president who\\'ll raise your taxes,\\nor fight for working families? a president who\\'ll

even smith had a\\nhard time getting through the world series. if you really want to\\nkeep his attention, challenge him at bowling.\\n\\nmalcolm a. smith, the minority leader of the\\nstate senate, is promising something drastic, by albany standards,\\nif democrats win control of the chamber on tuesday. he wants to\\nshare power with rank-and-file lawmakers.\\n\\nwhether he will follow through remains to be seen. but in an\\ninterview, smith, a queens democrat, who would be the state\\'s first\\nblack majority party leader if his party gains control of the\\nsenate, listed a litany of the sweeping promises politicians make\\nwhen they stand outside the levers of power.\\n\\nhe said he would reinvent the senate\\'s committees, which often\\nhave little discernable authority, and make them work more like\\ncommittees do in congress. he said he would move to cut the senate\\nmajority\\'s central staff by at least 15 percent, or roughly 100\\nworkers. he said he would narrow the wide gap between the resources\\nallocated to majority and minority party members for office\\nbudgets. and he would move quickly to introduce legislation to\\npublicly finance elections, despite the state\\'s fiscal crisis.\\n\\nsenate republicans express confidence they will hold their\\none-seat majority in the chamber, and tend to roll their eyes at\\nsmith for what they see as empty political grandstanding before an\\nelection. smith has made headlines before for claims that did not\\nmaterialize, including his boasts last year that he was close to\\nenticing some senate republicans to shift to his side of the aisle.\\n\\neven good-government groups are wary of bold promises, having\\nbeen disappointed by the administrations of gov. eliot spitzer and\\nhis onetime running mate, gov. david a. paterson, whose promises of\\nreform have not translated into much tangible alteration to the way\\nbusiness is done in albany.\\n\\nthe changes that smith describes, if they actually came to pass,\\ncould recast the often-inscrutable way business has long been\\nconducted by both political parties. legislative power resides with\\nthe senate majority leader and the speaker of the democratic-led\\nassembly, who form the so-called three men in a room who run the\\nstate alongside the governor. deals among the trio are typically\\nworked out behind closed doors, often with little public debate or\\ninfluence from the remaining 210 lawmakers.\\n\\n\"it\\'s time for new york state government to move into the 21st\\ncentury,\" smith said. \"it would be more transparent, more\\nparticipatory, from legislators to advocates to joe citizen.\"\\n\\nhe added that his leadership was \"not going to be about\\nexacting revenge\" for years of slights at the hands of senate\\nrepublicans, who have controlled the chamber for more than four\\ndecades.\\n\\nunder smith\\'s plan to change the senate\\'s rules, committees\\nwould have more autonomy to bring bills to the floor, and members\\nof a standing conference committee would seek to negotiate\\nlegislation with the assembly.\\n\\nthe ranking minority member of a committee could also put a bill\\non a committee\\'s agenda. and smith says he would also abolish a\\npractice put in place by republicans years ago that allows\\nessentially secret voting on hostile amendments or motions to send\\nstalled bills out of committees.\\n\\nhe would require committee members to attend meetings and would\\ndiscontinue the practice of holding committee meetings off the\\nsenate floor while the senate was in session. he would also end\\nlimits on the ability of senators in the minority to use what are\\nknown as \"discharge motions\" to force bills to the floor.\\n\\n\"if he delivered, it would be the equivalent of a political\\nearthquake,\" said blair horner, the legislative director of the\\nnew york public interest research group.\\n\\n\"but as we know from the 2006 election, when spitzer and\\npaterson ran to change albany and then they didn\\'t do anything,\\ntalk is easy; delivering is hard.\"\\n\\nas it stands, minority parties in albany are relegated to poor\\nstepchildren status.\\n\\ntake the issue of office budgets. the senate republicans spent\\n$445,904, on average, on their office budgets over the six months\\nending in march, according to a recent report by the empire center\\nfor new york state policy, a branch of the manhattan institute for\\npolicy research. by comparison, the senate democrats spent $274,316\\non their staff budgets, the report showed.\\n\\nsenate republicans have accused smith of being more concerned\\nwith process than with issues that matter to voters, but their main\\nand most potent electoral pitch has focused more on geography than\\npolicy. a democratic-led chamber would doom upstate, they say,\\nbecause it would leave all of the levers of government in the hands\\nof new york city residents for the first time in decades.\\n\\n\"every single leader would be from new york city,\" dean g.\\nskelos, the senate majority leader, said in an interview in albany\\nlast month.\\n\\nvoters outside the city, he said, \"are concerned about regional\\nbalance and fairness, so that\\'s resonating throughout the state.\"\\n\\nskelos, who did not comment for this story, is not from upstate,\\nbut from long island, though upstate members play a predominating\\nrole in his caucus.\\n\\n\"the reality is that what most people care about is what the\\nlegislature will do for them,\" said john mcardle, a spokesman for\\nskelos, citing issues like a mandatory ceiling on school property\\ntaxes, which smith has also supported.\\n\\n\"these are process issues that the vast majority of new yorkers\\nare not focused on,\" mcardle said.\\n\\nthey have sent microfilm clerks and security\\nguards from their desks in the capitol to the hustings of eastern\\nlong island and the buffalo suburbs. they have brought in a dozen\\noutside consultants, including a firm that produced the swift boat\\ncampaign against john kerry, to cut advertisements and raise money.\\nthey have spent millions of dollars to fight for seats that were\\nonce safely republican.\\n\\nno effort is being spared by new york republicans in the final\\ndays of this election season, which will determine whether they\\ncontinue to control the state senate, their only outpost of power\\nin an increasingly democratic state. even veterans like sen. caesar\\ntrunzo -- 82 years old and running against the son of a candidate he\\nbeat a quarter-century ago -- are making eight appearances a day to\\nshake hands and ask for votes.\\n\\n\"we just keep going along, doing what we have to do, and then\\nhope for the best,\" trunzo said recently as he rushed off to a\\ncampaign rally in patchogue, on long island. \"it\\'s so important\\nthat we control the new york state senate.\"\\n\\nrepublicans have held a majority in the senate for all but one\\nof the last 70 years, outlasting governors and presidents,\\nwatergate and jack abramoff, seemingly immune to the ebb and flow\\nof national politics. the senate majority has helped republicans\\ngarner millions of dollars for their campaigns and 10 times that in\\nstate aid for their mostly suburban or rural districts. it has been\\nthe party\\'s storehouse of institutional knowledge, the career\\nspringboard for generations of politicians and operatives, and the\\nlifeblood of some of albany\\'s most powerful lobbyists.\\n\\nbut now the republican majority is down to a single seat,\\nprovoking the most intense, expensive and sweeping campaign in many\\nyears. eight republican seats are being seriously contested, double\\nthe number in most recent election years.\\n\\n\"it\\'s different, because they\\'re fighting for their survival,\"\\nsaid michael d. dawidziak, a republican consultant. \"they haven\\'t\\nfought for survival in any of their lifetimes.\"\\n\\nthe potential loss of the senate majority is usually mentioned\\nonly glancingly on the campaign trail, in veiled references to the\\nneed for \"balanced government.\" but it is the urgent undercurrent\\nto conversations in campaign offices, in the hallways of the\\ncapitol and among local republican activists.\\n\\n\"our troops, the committeemen, the volunteers -- they are very\\naware of the albany piece, where they usually are not,\" said james\\np. domagalski, the republican chairman of erie county. \"they\\nunderstand what would happen if we lose the senate.\"\\n\\nthe long tenures of many republican senators fighting for\\nre-election -- some came into office in 1972 during richard nixon\\'s\\nlandslide re-election -- is a testament to the senate republicans\\'\\nendurance and agility. but facing the worst economic crisis since\\nthe great depression, a party name damaged by an unpopular\\nadministration in washington, and the chance that sen. barack\\nobama\\'s presidential bid will bring a surge of democratic voters to\\nthe polls, the challenge has never seemed so great.\\n\\n\"this is a national tide,\" said alfonse m. d\\'amato, a lobbyist\\nand a former u.s. senator, who has been a major fundraiser and\\nbooster for state senate republicans. \"sometimes the tide comes\\nin.\"\\n\\nd\\'amato said he was convinced that senate republicans would hold\\non this year despite the obstacles they faced. and publicly and\\nprivately, republican senators and aides scoff at the suggestion\\nthat this will be the year the majority cracks.\\n\\n\"i\\'m confident we\\'re going to be victorious, and i\\'m not\\nthinking about \\'what if,\"\\' said sen. charles j. fuschillo jr., of\\nlong island. \"because we\\'re not going to have deal with the \\'what\\nif.\"\\'\\n\\non the campaign trail, republicans have used their fundraising\\nadvantage to expand the playing field, devoting hundreds of\\nthousands of dollars to races in which democrats have shown\\nunexpected weakness, to offset possible republican losses. on\\nfriday, they sent mayor michael r. bloomberg, a key ally, to\\ncampaign with sen. serphin r. maltese of queens, who is the\\ndemocrats\\' top target.\\n\\nin recent weeks, republicans have aggressively have stoked fears\\nthat communities upstate and on long island would suffer from a\\ndemocratic takeover of the senate, which would leave the governor\\'s\\noffice and both legislative leadership posts in the hands of\\ndemocrats from the five boroughs. they are blunt about what is at\\nstake.\\n\\n\"the biggest fear is that if we lose the majority, all funding\\ngoes to new york city,\" said fuschillo.\\n\\nafter a devastating loss in february in an upstate special\\nelection, republicans revamped their campaign committee, bringing\\non new senior staff members, several with experience on\\npresidential campaigns. since that race -- where much of the\\ntelevision advertising was handled by a firm linked to a former\\nparty chairman -- the committee has broadly expanded its roster of\\ncampaign and advertising consultants, bringing in highly regarded\\ntalent from the beltway.\\n\\n\"we learned from the special that the tv in particular has to\\nbe top-notch. it can\\'t be the same old same old. you can\\'t use the\\nsame old political tactics,\" said sen. thomas w. libous, an\\nupstate republican and a leader of the party\\'s campaign effort.\\n\\nfacing an unprecedented number of races, senate republicans have\\ndevised a buddy system -- as it is known internally -- to send\\nsenators from safe districts to campaign for and advise incumbents\\nin tight races. party officials say they have also gotten safe\\nincumbents to contribute more campaign money than in the past to\\ntheir more vulnerable colleagues.\\n\\n\"they now say, \\'instead of trying to drive up my margins in my\\ndistrict, i should spend that time trying to help one of the weaker\\nguys win his race,\"\\' d\\'amato said.\\n\\nrepublicans are also preparing to unveil the kind of technology\\nmore familiar from presidential campaigns with\\nhundred-million-dollar budgets. in several key races on tuesday --\\nparty officials would not say which -- workers will use blackberrys\\nto check off republican voters as they arrive at polling places and\\nsend the lists to a central database, making the party\\'s turnout\\noperation far more efficient.\\n\\nin some races, the gop has resorted to methods that are\\nlower-tech but no less intensive. in westchester county, where\\nrepublicans are hoping for an upset victory, the republican\\ncandidate, liz feld, has been sending handwritten notes to voters\\nto ask for their support.\\n\\nthe loss of the majority, republicans say, would not only put\\ntheir districts at a disadvantage in albany. it could also cripple\\nthe party itself. the majority, after all, comes with roughly $85\\nmillion in earmark spending and hundreds of extra staff jobs in\\nalbany and in district offices. in most areas of the state,\\nrepublican senators sit atop a well-established political food\\nchain, providing patronage jobs, smoothing political disputes and\\nrunning local party organizations.\\n\\nvincent f. liguori, who is active with the republican committee\\nin islip, on long island, said that having trunzo as his senator\\nwas \"like having my father looking out for me.\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s like they say: to the victor belong the spoils,\" he\\nadded. \"there\\'s going to be a lot of people looking for work if he\\nloses.\"\\n\\ntampa  halfway through the regular season, there are really only\\ntwo observations to be made about the bucs: great defense,\\ndisappointing offense.\\n\\nthat hardly rates as news anymore. since jon gruden arrived from\\noakland in 2002 with a sterling reputation as an offensive\\nplay-caller, the bucs have ranked only once in the top 10 in total\\noffense (2003). this season, in terms of yardage, the bucs are 13th\\noverall, averaging 341.2 yards per game. but they are 21st in the\\nleague in scoring at 21.2 points per game.\\n\\nin fact, the bucs have scored just 13 touchdowns this season and\\nare on pace to have one of their worst seasons, second only to when\\nthey had 20 touchdowns in the 4-12 season with rookie quarterback\\nbruce gradkowski.\\n\\nit\\'s somewhat perplexing, especially considering that the\\noffensive line, with free agent center jeff faine, is probably\\nbetter and deeper than at any time in the franchise\\'s history. and\\nquarterback jeff garcia, 38, while hobbled by injuries early, has\\ndone a decent job protecting the football.\\n\\nand yet, with a win today against 1-6 kansas city, the bucs\\ncould enter the bye week 6-3 and a half game back of carolina in\\nthe nfc south. remarkable.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve just been very impressed with our team,\" gruden said.\\n\"i don\\'t want to speak out about any individuals, although i think\\nwe\\'ve had some guys that have really exploded onto the scene, pro\\nbowl caliber players. i really think the center is a great player.\\ni think we\\'re getting better on the line.\\n\\n\"i think earnest graham, what he\\'s done, speaks volumes about\\nthe kind of man he is and the football player he is. defensively\\nspeaking, our secondary, those guys are for real. and our\\nlinebacking corps, those guys are outstanding players. tanard\\njackson  i hope some of these guys get the recognition they\\ndeserve. barrett ruud, i hope he gets the recognition.\"\\n\\nso what do the bucs have to do to challenge for the lombardi\\ntrophy in super bowl xliii at raymond james stadium?\\n\\nget healthy: fullback b.j. askew will miss his sixth game due to\\na hamstring tear today. his backup, byron storer, is on injured\\nreserve with a torn right acl. jameel cook, who hadn\\'t played in\\ntampa bay since \\'05, isn\\'t up to speed on the offense.\\n\\nthat meant graham had to move to fullback. and it resulted in\\nmore carries for warrick dunn, which led to a pinched nerve in his\\nback that will likely keep him out today.\\n\\n\"warrick and i were in there for a while, and we were kind of\\nfeeding off each other,\" graham said. \"then everything that\\nhappened, injuries (to storer) and b.j., you got out of that\\npattern. we\\'ve just got to get back in that rhythm. we need to get\\nthis game and get some guys healthy.\"\\n\\nthe bucs have been without joey galloway most of the season.\\nit\\'ll be interesting to see what he and antonio bryant can do the\\nsecond half.\\n\\nplay better on the road: the bucs have lost eight of their past\\n12 road games and are 1-3 this season. worse yet, tampa bay\\'s\\noffense has scored just two touchdowns on the road.\\n\\nwhen you consider that the bucs have lost at home in the\\nwild-card round of the playoffs twice in the past three years, the\\nprospect of doing anything in the postseason on the road is\\ndaunting.\\n\\n\"but we\\'ve got to win some big games,\" gruden said. \"we\\'ve\\ngot to play better on the road. but i like this team. they\\'re\\ntogether, they play hard. we have some young players playing, too.\\nwe\\'re building our team just like everybody else is. there\\'s been\\nsome real positive signs. obviously, there are some areas we\\'d like\\nto clean up and get better at. health has a lot to do with that,\\ntoo. you\\'ve got to get your team healthy, and the best players have\\nto play for you to play your best.\"\\n\\nbeat carolina: it\\'s a safe bet the season will come down to the\\nmonday night football game at carolina on dec. 8. if the bucs win,\\nthey will own a sweep of the panthers and the first tiebreaker.\\n\\nthe panthers have tough road games to navigate the second half\\nat green bay, at the new york giants and at new orleans.\\n\\nso, who\\'s next?  now that the phillies have given philadelphia\\nits first major sports championship since 1983, what city is next\\nin line to moan and groan about its title drought?  most major\\ncities with at least two pro sports teams have

downtown\\npueblo, colo., obama continued his tactic of tying mccain to the\\nbush administration.\\n\\n\"president bush is sitting out the last few days before the\\nelection. but earlier today, dick cheney came out of his\\nundisclosed location and hit the campaign trail. he said that he\\nis, and i quote, \\'delighted to support john mccain,\\' \" obama said.\\n\\n\"i\\'d like to congratulate sen. mccain on this endorsement\\nbecause he really earned it. that endorsement didn\\'t come easy.\\nsen. mccain had to vote 90 percent of the time with george bush and\\ndick cheney to get

\"he goes\\nout and trick-or-treats as george bush.\"\\n\\nthe joke hit the sweet spot for danny jacobs, who leaned back\\nhis head and howled his approval.\\n\\n\"we got them right where we want them,\" he said, mocking\\nmccain\\'s recent appraisal of his chances.\\n\\nobama asked supporters whether they thought cheney and mccain\\n\"have been talking about how to shake things up,\" he said.\\n\\n\"colorado, we know better. after all, it was just a few days\\nago that sen. mccain said that he and president bush share a\\n\\'common philosophy.\\'\\n\\n\"... so george bush may be in an undisclosed location, but dick\\ncheney\\'s out there on the campaign trail because he\\'d be delighted\\nto pass the baton to john mccain. he knows that with john mccain\\nyou get a two-fer: george bush\\'s economic policy and dick cheney\\'s\\nforeign policy -- but that\\'s a risk we cannot afford to take.\"\\n\\nbefore the obamas took the stage, retired army gen. wesley clark\\nurged

organize a\\ncampaign rally for cousin george at dove valley. he soon regretted\\nthe decision, as some democratic season-ticket holders took\\noffense.\\n\\n\"joe is not political.\" broncos owner pat bowlen said. \"he\\'s\\nbeen a football guy all his life. he\\'s a bush, but it\\'s sort of\\nlike a family thing to him. he keeps it there.\"\\n\\nthis year more than any other, there has been

tax\\nbenefits to a 53-man roster whose average salary approaches $1.8\\nmillion, obama is well-represented inside the broncos\\' locker room.\\nhis most overt supporter may be receiver brandon marshall, who has\\nbeen wearing obama t-shirts to his weekly news conferences.\\n\\nhis latest included an obama portrait with the inscription: \"do\\nyou smell what barack is cookin\\'?\"\\n\\nthe outgoing marshall, though, is more listener than participant\\nwhen the presidential race turns serious inside the players\\'\\nsanctuary.\\n\\n\"usually the liberals in here are outweighed by the\\nconservatives, at least for the politically aware,\" jackson said.\\n\\nthe conservative-leaning broncos, it seems, are more likely to\\nrecite the tax advantages for those drawing a $600,000-plus salary.\\n\\n\"money is not the only issue in here,\" jackson said.\\n\"however, what you do find is those who are mccain supporters,\\noverwhelmingly their no. 1 reason is because of money.\"\\n\\ntoo bad tom nalen wasn\\'t around to hear that. the veteran center\\nwas said by several teammates to be mccain\\'s top dove valley\\nsupporter until his transfer to the injured reserve list in\\nseptember left him rehabbing at odd hours.\\n\\nat least nalen was replaced by another mccain man.\\n\\n\"moreso because of abortion, gay marriage, things like that,\"\\nproud republican and center casey wiegmann said. \"taxes, that\\nhelps, but you\\'re going to pay your taxes no matter what. i mean,\\ni\\'ve been playing for 13 years in this league. taxes are a part of\\nit.\"\\n\\nthere can be no debate: the broncos are a bipartisan locker\\nroom. a fair number of players are pulling for obama. many others\\nwill be voting for mccain.\\n\\nkicker matt prater would be an independent if he was anything.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t vote,\" he said. \"my mom wants obama and my dad wants\\nmccain, so i don\\'t get into it too much. besides, i\\'ve got my own\\ntheory on

issue\\ninside the broncos\\' locker room, although one would think it might\\ncome up during the sweltering days of training camp.\\n\\n\"the environment is not an issue,\" jackson said. \"health\\ncare, no one cares about the health-care issue. we all have great\\nhealth care in here. foreign policy is an issue. but it\\'s more of\\nlike a machismo issue. it\\'s not about diplomacy. it\\'s about, \\'we\\nare america. we are stronger, we have to keep on the attack.\\' \"\\n\\nmany players were reluctant to share their preference. receiver\\ndarrell jackson and running back michael pittman, though, quietly\\ndeclared their support for obama.\\n\\n\"i had never heard of obama before he joined the presidential\\nrace,\" pittman said. \"i\\'m dead serious. never heard of him. but\\nonce i started hearing him talk and the way people gather around\\nhim and (he) carried himself, he rubbed off on me.\"\\n\\nordinarily, football locker rooms are like summer parties -- it\\'s\\nnot cool to talk politics or religion. they are subjects with\\ndiffering opinions, which leads to offended feelings.\\n\\nthis year, though, the broncos haven\\'t been afraid to go there.\\n\\n\"i think this is a bigger deal,\" harris said. \"either way,\\nthere\\'s history being made. i think it\\'s a reflection of the race\\nitself.\"\\n\\nof course, there are more serious

pennington has never referred to himself as the second\\ncoming of dan marino. jay cutler has referred to himself, well, you\\nknow how he has referred to himself.\\n\\nto wit: broncos vs. dolphins is as fascinating as a bourne or a\\nbond movie, as fun as spring break in fort lauderdale and the first\\nday of skiing in steamboat springs.\\n\\nand there won\\'t be a snowstorm in denver on halloween weekend.\\nnothing but blue skies and 74 degrees of colorado bliss.\\n\\nin the sept. 19, 1971, opener at old mile high stadium (not to\\nbe confused with the london-owned corporation sellout field

elected\\nto run out the clock and accept the tie.\\n\\nsome younger football fantasy players among us might ask: \"why\\ndidn\\'t the broncos go for two when they scored their touchdown?\\nshanahan would,\" or \"why take the risk? the broncos knew they\\ncould win in overtime.\"\\n\\ntwo problems: after the afl merged with the nfl, there was no\\ntwo-point conversion, and the nfl overtime period had not been\\ninvented.\\n\\nin his postgame spiel justifying his decision, saban muttered\\nthat immortal sentence: \"half a loaf is better than none.\"\\n\\nhalf-a-loaf lou grabbed a baton and

of\\nrepublican dominance showing evident signs of exhaustion.\\n\\nin purely political terms, 2008 is a rarity. not since\\nrepublican dwight eisenhower faced democrat adlai stevenson in 1952\\nhas neither candidate been part of an incumbent ticket. mccain\\'s\\nrunning mate, alaska gov. sarah palin, is the first female\\nrepublican vice presidential nominee, and with obama, ends a\\n219-year tradition of two white males heading the major parties.\\n\\nobama would be not only the first black u.s. president, but \"so\\nfar as i know, this would be the first time a white-majority\\ncountry has ever elected a non white head of state,\" said boston\\nuniversity historian bruce schulman. it would be the equivalent, he\\nsaid, of a jamaican-descended prime minister of britain, an\\nalgerian-descended president of france, or a turkish german\\nchancellor. \"that\\'s pretty astonishing in world historical\\nterms.\"\\n\\npolitics is always evolving, but there are moments in history\\nwhen bigger changes occur: the 1932 election of president franklin\\nd. roosevelt that ushered in the new deal and a long democratic\\nreign; the political upheavals of the 1960s that began with\\ndemocratic president john f. kennedy, saw the civil rights\\nrevolution, the great society and the vietnam war under democrat\\nlyndon b. johnson before ending with the resignation of republican\\npresident richard nixon; and the gop\\'s rebirth with the 1980\\nelection of president ronald reagan.\\n\\neach reflected generational change. stanford university\\npolitical scientist morris fiorina, who is writing a book on the\\npolitics of generational shifts, likes to use the rev. jesse\\njackson\\'s gaffe during this year\\'s campaign to illustrate.\\n\\nthinking his microphone was off during a break in a fox news\\nshow last july, jackson whispered to a co-panelist that obama\\n\"talks down to black people\" adding in crude terms that he would\\nlike personally to mutilate the democratic nominee. talk afterward\\nwas \"about the aging lion versus the young cub, and jackson being\\npushed aside,\" fiorina said. \"that\\'s really going on\\neverywhere.\"\\n\\naging conservative evangelical leaders are fading as younger\\nchristian conservatives question their orthodoxies. the democratic\\nprimaries saw a split between older feminists backing sen. hillary\\nrodham clinton and younger women backing obama.\\n\\nclinton, her husband, president bill clinton, and his successor,\\npresident bush, all were products of the vietnam era and the\\ncultural conflicts of the 1960s. if obama were to win and serve two\\nterms, said schulman, \"it\\'s hard to imagine that we would have a\\npresident again who was of that \\'60s generation.\"\\n\\nthe millennial generation rivals the baby boom in size and, now,\\ninfluence. more than a third of the voting age population was born\\nafter watergate. today\\'s college freshmen, born after reagan\\'s\\npresidency, have no memory of it. \"we carry these things with us\\nall our lives,\" fiorina said, \"and then the younger generations\\ncoming up don\\'t have the same experiences and attitudes.\"\\n\\ntake the strong link between age and views on gay rights or\\nabortion. young people take both for granted. \"for every 100\\npeople over age 70 who die and are replaced by 100 people between\\n18 and 24, you get more liberal social attitudes,\" fiorina said.\\n\\nolder generations grew up with big government programs of the\\nnew deal and great society, and when those grew creaky, were open\\nto something new, fiorina said. \"the current generation has grown\\nup with a much more laissez-faire approach to government, and now\\nthere\\'s a mess, so they say, ok, let\\'s try something else.\"\\n\\nyet for partisans, it is the threat or hope of ideological\\nchange that matters most. the mood among conservatives has grown\\ndarker each day. not only mccain but much of the conservative\\nintellectual elite warn of an impending turn to european-style\\nsocialism at home and appeasement abroad, especially if democrats\\nseize a monopoly in washington.\\n\\nhistorians call the fears exaggerated, a reflection of the\\ncountry\\'s 30-year rightward shift. on many issues, obama is to the\\nright of nixon, the republican who proposed a guaranteed income for\\nall americans, supported affirmative action, imposed wage and price\\ncontrols, and established much of today\\'s environmental regulation.\\n\\n\"a conservative in 1968 was far more liberal than a liberal is\\nin 2008,\" said schulman.\\n\\ncrushing budget deficits will hamstring ambitious policy\\nchanges. despite the likelihood of powerful democratic majorities\\nin congress -- they could resemble the 1964 democratic landslide\\nunder johnson -- the deficit will constrain any obama-style great\\nsociety or mccain tax cuts.\\n\\npressing economic demands will land on the next president\\'s\\ndesk. \"he didn\\'t have any discretion over them, they\\'re just\\nthere,\" said george edwards, a presidential scholar at texas a&amp;amp;m\\nuniversity. \"that\\'s going to be a constraint on him. the world has\\na way of doing that to presidents.\"\\n\\nif mccain wins, a democratic congress would force him leftward\\nas it did nixon, reinforcing mccain\\'s own ambivalence toward his\\nparty. some predict he would be a caretaker president.\\n\\n\"mccain could not govern on economic or other issues from the\\nright,\" said christopher malone, a political scientist at pace\\nuniversity. \"he\\'s going to look at 58, 59 democratic senators. he\\nhas no option but to govern from the center and even left of\\ncenter.\"\\n\\nmccain could emulate eisenhower, who lost control of congress in\\nhis first term, and only modulated democratic policies.\\n\\nan obama victory offers two potential paths: a major political\\nrealignment, following roosevelt in 1932 and reagan in 1980. this\\nwould require that he rack up successes in his first two years, a\\nhoneymoon when presidential power is at its peak.\\n\\nif he does, and realignment is under way, he could avoid the\\ncatastrophic losses that clinton suffered after his 1993 health\\ncare plan crashed under a democratic congress, replaced in 1994 by\\na republican one.\\n\\nanother model is 1964, with a big democratic win followed by a\\ncollapse four years later, or 1976, when democrat jimmy carter ran\\na flawless campaign but proved a weak leader unable to control his\\nparty or rally the public.\\n\\n\"you could have a scenario where obama is under a lot of\\npressure from his left and yet can\\'t do big economic things because\\nof the difficult situation we\\'re in, where he can\\'t disengage from\\niraq and afghanistan as quickly as the base would like,\" fiorina\\nsaid. obama could then come under attack from his left, face\\ncongressional losses in 2010 and by 2012 a challenge from his own\\nparty, perhaps hillary clinton.\\n\\nwhatever happens, many sense that the page is turning.\\n\\n\"this is one of those very rare, once-in-a-generation\\ntransforming elections in america that marks the end of one\\npolitical era and the beginning of another,\" said allan lichtman,\\na political historian at american university. \"that will certainly\\nbe true if obama is elected, because he\\'s going to come in with\\noverwhelming control of the government. it\\'s even true if mccain\\ngets elected, because he\\'s not going to be able to turn back the\\nclock to the old conservative era.\"\\n\\nlos angeles - their votes won\\'t count this year, but the 750\\nkids going to welby way elementary school in west hills are still\\ngoing to the polls

was guaranteed its place in the national spotlight in\\nmay when the state supreme court ruled that same-sex marriage is a\\nconstitutional right, overturning a ban of such marriages approved\\nby 61 percent of voters in 2000.\\n\\nthat court decision meant supporters of same-sex marriage could\\nfight from a moral high ground using the argument that prop. 8\\nwould legitimize discrimination

and high unemployment, and reagan\\'s first 87\\nappointments were related to economic policy, said martha joynt\\nkumar, director of the nonpartisan white house transition project,\\nwhich works with the current administration and the president-elect\\nto ease the takeover.\\n\\nreagan quickly began schmoozing congressional leaders  friendly\\nrepublicans in the senate, hostile democrats in the house  to lay\\nthe groundwork for his legislative agenda of cutting taxes,\\nrevamping the military and cutting other government spending.\\n\\nthe budget he submitted shortly after his inauguration reflected\\nthose priorities, and set the tone for his presidency.\\n\\nclinton, by contrast, didn\\'t name some of his key people until\\njust days before his inauguration in january.\\n\\nhis first major domestic initiative, health care reform, failed\\nin part because the administration and its point-person, first lady\\nhillary rodham clinton, were essentially unprepared. they hadn\\'t\\nrecruited enough congressional support or developed a strategy for\\ngetting it passed. instead of an accomplishment, it served as a\\nlesson.\\n\\n\"once you come into the white house, there\\'s no time to be\\nlooking backwards and thinking about what the job is,\" kumar said.\\n\\n\"but if people are named right after an election, they have\\ntime to read, they have time to talk

smart\\n\\naside from inheriting national disasters, roosevelt and lincoln\\nhad one thing in common: they knew what they didn\\'t know.\\n\\nlincoln was a congressman from rural illinois. roosevelt was\\nhighly experienced, having been secretary of the navy and governor\\nof new york, but he wasn\\'t an expert on the economy. unlike some\\nother presidents, he valued outside  and contrary  opinions and\\nrecruited a team of respected academics known as the brain trust to\\nhelp him plan the new deal.\\n\\nlincoln took the unusual step of appointing several republican\\nrivals to his cabinet, including harsh critics like william seward,\\nhis secretary of state, and, in 1862, edward stanton, his secretary\\nof war.\\n\\nboth later became close friends and supporters of lincoln\\'s. but\\nwhen they were picked, lincoln knew they would challenge his\\nassumptions and ideas, as well as each other\\'s. members of\\nroosevelt\\'s brain trust often disagreed with each other as well.\\n\\n\"he took these people who were smart and somewhat rivals and\\nbrought them inside the tent  and took what he could from them,\"\\nsaid michael shaller, a history professor at the

the past two months\\n\\nwith no federal insurance to protect deposits  and the financial\\nsystem was literally collapsing.\\n\\nthe first thing he did was issue a proclamation briefly closing\\nall

he\\'s stepping into a\\nsituation where people are looking for answers,\" said herman\\neberhardt, the museum curator at the franklin d. roosevelt\\npresidential library and museum in new york.\\n\\nthen roosevelt, abetted by a democratic congress, got to work on\\npassing his 100 days agenda  16 major bills in all, including\\nregulatory reforms, creation of the civilian conservation corps.,\\nand initiatives to help railroads, farmers and homeowners.\\n\\nit is doubtful mccain or obama would try, or need, to push so\\nmany sweeping measures next year, but the lesson is a valuable one\\nfor a president confronted by crisis.\\n\\n\"some of what roosevelt proposed worked. some of what roosevelt\\nproposed didn\\'t work. some of the policies he advocated were\\ncontradictory,\" eberhardt said. \"but what mattered to most people\\nat the time was he was coming in and taking decisive action.\\n\\n\"that in itself was inspiring to people, and raised hope  he\\nwas taking an active, aggressive stance that he was going to\\naddress this problem.\"\\n\\npick your shots\\n\\nmore recent presidents who scored quickly have done so by\\nlimiting their goals. think lyndon b. johnson\\'s dogged approach to\\npassing civil rights legislation after taking over for president\\nkennedy in late 1963, or reagan\\'s focus on just three things:\\ncutting taxes, cutting domestic spending and rebuilding the\\nmilitary. he accomplished the first two in his first year, despite\\ndemocratic control of the house.\\n\\n\"reagan did one thing that i really think presidents

weren\\'t financially feasible, thanks\\nto the deficits he inherited, and he struggled with where to start.\\nmembers of his inner circle disagreed over what they should do\\nfirst  address social problems such as health care, or lasso the\\ndeficit.\\n\\nabsent a driving narrative, lesser and less flattering issues\\nfilled the void  his policy on gays in the military, a botched\\nattorney general appointment, a scandal over firing the white house\\ntravel office.\\n\\n\"he just wasn\\'t ready,\" patterson said.\\n\\ndespite having only 37 days between al gore\\'s concession and his\\ninauguration, george w. bush\\'s transition went smoothly in part\\nbecause his priorities for office had formed the backbone of his\\ncampaign: cut taxes, pay religious groups to provide social\\nservices, reform social security, and set federal standards for\\neducation.\\n\\nhe achieved three out of four before the sept. 11, 2001,\\nterrorist attacks forever altered his place in history.\\n\\n\"he was not left in a position with a vacuum that other people\\ncould fill with discussions about the murky election,\" kumar said.\\n\"he could talk about what he wanted to talk about.  the public was\\nready for it, too, because they had heard him discuss it.\"\\n\\nperception is reality\\n\\nhistory teaches that even if things don\\'t go that well for obama\\nor mccain over the next couple of years, he may not suffer for it.\\nit\\'s easy to forget this, but despite all he did, fdr never solved\\nthe great depression. by the end of his first year in office, in\\n1934, unemployment remained at nearly 22 percent. by his first\\nre-election campaign in 1936, it was still at a staggering 17\\npercent.\\n\\nyet roosevelt remained wildly popular, carrying all but two\\nstates and 60 percent of the popular vote, the biggest landslide in\\n80 years.\\n\\n\"there were a lot of poor people who had a picture of jesus\\nchrist on their wall, and a picture of roosevelt nailed up on their\\nwall, often cut out from the newspaper,\" patterson said.\\n\\n\"either of these guys gets elected, they\\'re coming into power\\nat a time where you\\'ve got really serious problems that are hung\\nover from the past, that you\\'ve inherited. if you make a\\nconsiderable dent in them  that is to say, if what you do seems to\\nwork out  you will have something

wes allison, washington  as election day nears, sens. john mccain and barack obama are sparring over the economy, taxes, health care and each other. but the next president of the united states may make his most lasting imprint on the u.s. supreme court. with four of the nine justices in their 70s and one in his 80s, the next president likely will have the privilege of appointing at least one new justice to the court, experts say, if not two or three. because the most likely retirees lean left, mccain has the best chance of either candidate to significantly remake the court in his own view, by replacing liberals with conservatives.      relatively young, and apparently in good health. the fourth,\\nantonin scalia, 72, is unlikely to retire any time soon, either.\\n\\nthough he has angered many conservatives through the years by\\ntaking contrary stances on the environment, campaign finance and\\nmedical research, mccain has pledged to choose judges in the mold\\nof president bush\\'s appointees, chief justice john roberts and\\njustice samuel alito jr., who are favorites within the conservative\\nmovement.\\n\\n\"whatever is going to happen with the economy is going to be\\naffected by a lot more people and a lot more forces than the\\npresident,\" said wendy long, a former clerk to conservative\\njustice clarence thomas and chief counsel for the judicial\\nconfirmation network, which advocates for the appointment of\\nconservative judges.\\n\\n\"it\\'s going to be affected by the markets, it\\'s going to be\\naffected by congress and  by what private banks do, and\\nindividuals. but what happens to the court is going to be up to one\\nman.\"\\n\\nshe added: \"whoever it is, obama or mccain, is going to\\nbasically shape the court for most of this century and shape the\\ninterpretation of the constitution.\"\\n\\nliberal activists agree. the court now is roughly split four to\\nfour, with justice anthony kennedy, 72, a ronald reagan appointee,\\noften casting the deciding vote. replacing liberal justices john\\npaul stevens, 88, or ruth bader ginsberg, 75, with a conservative,\\nas mccain pledges to do, would push the court to the right.\\n\\nwhich is why, as the judicial confirmation network runs ads in\\nswing states urging support for mccain, the liberal people for the\\namerican way is running ads in swing states for obama.\\n\\nkathryn kolbert, president of the group, says a whole host of\\npolicies hangs in the balance, including abortion, environmental\\nregulations and the right of citizens to sue corporations.\\n\\n\"i think this election will have the most significant effect on\\nthe supreme court than any we\\'ve seen in 40 years, because the\\ncourt is so divided, and it\\'s on the brink of being taken over by\\nconservative forces,\" kolbert said.\\n\\nphilosophically, the argument is how the supreme court should\\ninterpret the constitution. mccain, bush and other conservative\\nleaders say they favor so-called strict constructionists, jurists\\nwho view the constitution not as a living, changing document, but\\none that grants rights only specifically given by the constitution.\\n\\npractically speaking, the biggest affront to this approach was\\nthe 1973 ruling roe vs. wade, which allowed legal abortion in all\\n50 states.\\n\\nat issue was the high court\\'s finding that the constitution\\nguarantees a right to privacy  and, by extension, a woman\\'s right\\nto seek an abortion. (which is why mccain\\'s running mate, alaska\\ngov. sarah palin, raised eyebrows when she told cbs news anchor\\nkatie couric that she supports overturning roe vs. wade, yet also\\nbelieves the constitution guarantees the right to privacy.)\\n\\nbut this view has many other implications, including the\\ngovernment\\'s ability to regulate business, the legal basis for\\naffirmative action in hiring, and the prosecution of class-action\\nsuits.\\n\\nmccain gave his most explicit nod to this philosophy in a speech\\nin may at wake forest university in north carolina, which is often\\nquoted by conservative activists. \"my nominees will understand\\nthat there are clear limits to the scope of judicial power, and\\nclear limits to the scope of federal power,\" he said.\\n\\nthose on the other side prefer a more open-ended approach to\\nregulation, the courts, and civil and personal liberties. obama has\\nsaid he would appoint judges with empathy for others, and whose\\nexperiences have shaped their judicial philosophy. give him the\\nkeys to the supreme court, conservatives warn, and say hello to\\nnational requirements for gay marriage, an end to restrictions on\\ncertain types of abortions, and an american business community\\nravaged by liability lawsuits.\\n\\ncarl tobias of the university of richmond law school in\\nvirginia, an expert in federal judicial appointments, said in\\nreality an obama presidency most likely would ensure the status\\nquo.\\n\\n\"all this talk about how obama would make this a very liberal\\ncourt or something is absurd,\" tobias said. \"if he is elected,\\nthe opportunities are just not going to be there, because i think\\nhe\\'s going to be replacing people with relatively like-minded\\npeople.\"\\n\\nin their own words from the oct. 15 debate\\n\\n\"i believe strongly that we should have nominees to the united\\nstates supreme court based on their qualifications rather than any\\nlitmus test.  i voted for justice breyer and justice ginsburg. not\\nbecause i agreed with their ideology, but because i thought they\\nwere qualified, and that elections have consequences when\\npresidents are nominated.  i do not believe that someone who has\\nsupported roe vs. wade ... would be part of those qualifications.\"\\n\\njohn mccain\\n\\n\"well, i think it\\'s true that we shouldn\\'t apply a strict\\nlitmus test, and the most important thing in any judge is their\\ncapacity to provide fairness and justice to the american people.\\nand it is true that this is going to be, i think, one of the most\\nconsequential decisions of the next president. it is very likely\\nthat one of us will be making at least one and probably more than\\none appointments, and roe vs. wade probably hangs in the balance.\"\\n\\nbarack obama\\n\\n      the current lineup of justices\\n            the left      the middle      the right\\n      john paul stevens,\\n      88, appointed by president gerald ford, 1975\\n\\n      ruth bader ginsberg,\\n      75, appointed by president bill clinton, 1993\\n\\n      steven breyer,\\n      70, appointed by president bill clinton, 1994\\n\\n      david souter,\\n      69, appointed by president george bush, 1990\\n\\n      anthony kennedy,\\n      72, appointed by president ronald reagan, 1988\\n\\n      antonin scalia,\\n      72, appointed by president ronald reagan, 1986\\n\\n      clarence thomas,\\n      60, appointed by the first president bush, 1991\\n\\n      samuel alito jr.,\\n      58, appointed by president bush, 2006\\n\\n      john roberts,\\n      53, chief justice, appointed by president bush, 2005\\n\\ncox news service\\n\\nathens, greece -- not so long ago, many travelers dismissed\\nathens, with its scruffy streets, traffic pandemonium, and\\nlackadaisical service, as mostly a jumping-off point for some\\nreally gorgeous greek island.\\n\\nbut since the 2004 olympics this capital city, bathed in\\nmillennia of history, has been rejuvenated for the new millennium.\\n\\nnot only is there an efficient airport, a sparkling new metro\\nsystem, and a plethora of high-end boutique hotels, but the service\\nat the restaurants i visited recently was impeccable, more on par\\nwith that found in america than in europe.

show-stopper, especially\\nwhen it is lit up at dusk.\\n\\ngenerally the best time to visit, though, is just after the\\nopening time of 8 a.m., when crowds are sparse and temperatures\\ncooler.\\n\\nalthough there are plenty of ancient treasures in athens, there\\nalso are many modern delights to discover, including hip\\npedestrianized shopping areas, michelin-starred restaurants, trendy\\nshops, and bars featuring traditional bouzouki music.\\n\\none particularly delightful jumble of streets in the shadow of\\nthe acropolis is the plaka neighborhood, where people seem to eat\\nand shop all day and into the night. here, you\\'d be hard-pressed to\\nfind a taverna serving a bad meal. place after place serves up the\\nmost mouth-watering greek delicacies: fresh salads, fried calamari,\\ntzatziki, meatballs, lamb chops, pork kebabs, feta cheese, and\\nspanakopitas, or spinach pies.\\n\\nanother neighborhood popular with locals and tourists alike is\\npsiri, the old leather district of narrow streets that\\'s now often\\nreferred to as athens\\' coolest new area, a soho-like place where\\ntiny shops that look like they\\'ve been closed for years give way to\\na hotbed of nightlife once the sun goes down.\\n\\nthe hotel i stayed in, ochre &amp;amp; brown, a lovely 11-room boutique\\nhotel, was perfectly located about a 10-minute walk from the\\nacropolis, on the edge of psiri and close to plaka. the service\\nhere was almost too good, if there is such a thing, with desk\\nclerks constantly asking me if there was anything i needed.\\n\\nnot only do the rooms boast parquet floors, flat-screen tvs and\\ninternet access, but the hotel also has a stylish restaurant and\\nlounge.\\n\\non nearby streets are other design-driven hotels, all a\\ntestament to developers\\' faith in the future of the tourism\\nindustry.\\n\\nas athens settles into its post-olympic mode, these sleek new\\nhotels are part of a modern new face on a

caldecott honor award, a boston globe/horn book award and\\ndozens of other major citations in his 17-year career.\\n\\nnearly every book starts with a nagging question.\\n\\nwhat if we did a book about the way animals talk to each other,\\nhe wondered once. the answer was \"slap, squeak and scatter: how\\nanimals communicate.\"\\n\\ncan a picture book show exactly how big certain prehistoric\\ncreatures were? answer: \"prehistoric actual size!\"\\ndsungaripterus, a flying reptile, requires a four-page foldout to\\ndisplay its menacing, toothy beak.\\n\\none of jenkins\\' questions -- what\\'s a powerful way to teach\\nchildren about specialization and adaptation? -- begets another,\\n\"what do you do with a tail like this?\"\\n\\nbesides showing how the animals use that part of their bodies,\\nthe text visually hints at the movement. \"if you\\'re a lizard, you\\nbreak off your\" is separated from \"tail to get away\" in\\nimitation of the lizard\\'s defense strategy. that won a 2004\\ncaldecott honor award.\\n\\n\"whatever he does, we buy it,\" said sue lubens, owner of the\\nbookies, which specializes in children\\'s and educational books.\\n\\n\"we have teachers who come in and ask, \\'what\\'s the new steve\\njenkins book? has anything come from him lately?\\' \"\\n\\njenkins\\' books combine arresting images with equally riveting\\ntext. dinocephalosaurus, he notes in \"prehistoric actual size,\"\\n\"wasn\\'t a dinosaur. it was a fish-eating reptile that sucked up\\nits prey by quickly stretching out its long neck.\" try to erase\\nthat mental picture before turning out the lights tonight.\\n\\nthe amount of time that jenkins devotes to research eclipses the\\nphysical work on his books. an information junkie, he is delighted\\nto learn, for example, that female earwigs are unusually maternal,\\nbrooding their eggs and grooming the hatched larvae.\\n\\nhe and his wife and frequent collaborator, robin page, work\\nalmost daily in the tidy, whimsical studio in their north boulder,\\ncolo., home.\\n\\nflat, broad drawers stash his color-sorted collage papers. an\\narchitectural vertical bookshelf holds research materials. the high\\nwalls are adorned with period kitsch, including a b-movie poster\\nand some paint-by-numbers paintings.\\n\\ntheir projects fall into what jenkins calls \"the niche between\\nboard books and books that are more encyclopedic\" -- text-heavy\\nnonfiction that may not captivate their target audience of children\\nbetween 5 and 9 years old.\\n\\n\"often, a first, second or third grade kid understands concepts\\nbut they may not be intrigued by a lot of facts,\" jenkins\\nexplained.\\n\\n\"so instead, you give them a book about problem-solving that\\'s\\nreally a book about evolution.\"\\n\\nbefore turning to picture books, jenkins spent 20 years as a\\ncommercial graphic designer in new york city. jenkins loved that,\\nbut found illustrating children\\'s books as a way to marry his\\nlifelong fascination with science -- his boyhood goal was to become\\na scientist -- with art.\\n\\nthough jenkins sometimes illustrates books written by other\\nauthors, he increasingly writes as well as illustrating. his secret\\nfor avoiding ennui: \"never work on anything that doesn\\'t fascinate\\nme personally.\"\\n\\namong his current projects is \"down, down, down: a journey to\\nthe bottom of the sea,\" a book due in stores next spring that\\nvisually illustrates the ocean\\'s depth.\\n\\n\"i was interested in doing a book about the ocean, and i wanted\\nto start at the surface and go straight down,\" he said.\\n\\n\"if you explore that thought, it\\'s like a diver descending. the\\nocean is 3 miles deep, on average. you have the surface, the\\ntwilight zone, and then the bulk of the ocean is that dark zone. we\\ndon\\'t know much about it,\" he says. \"more people have visited the\\nsurface of the moon than the deepest part of the ocean.\"\\n\\nas he researched the most lightless parts of the deep blue sea,\\njenkins learned about \"bait balls,\" which are schools of fish\\nthat swim so tightly bunched that their bodies touch as they swim.\\nhe learned about the primary means of deep-ocean communication:\\nbioluminescence.\\n\\nand because he was fascinated by the mariana trench when he was\\na boy, he chose the deep pacific ocean formation as the bottom of\\nhis visual dive.\\n\\n\"i wanted to do a spread on the hydro-thermal vents, where\\nsuper-heated water comes in,\" he said.\\n\\n\"you know, until the 1970s, scientists assumed that life\\ndepends on the sun. but then they found life around the vents, and\\nthat opened new possibilities for anaerobic life on earth -- and\\nother planets. i think about science in a cross-curriculum way.\"\\n\\nthat\\'s a deliberate response to the social and educational\\nemphasis on standardized tests, and a strategy for persuading young\\nreaders to stick with nonfiction as they move on to sophisticated\\nbooks.\\n\\n\"there\\'s a thing that happens in fourth or fifth grade where\\nkids move away from picture books to chapter books, and from\\nnonfiction to fiction,\" jenkins said.\\n\\n\"science education has some real challenges now, and it\\'s not\\njust politics and intelligent design.\"\\n\\ncapsule reviews of recent children\\'s book releases.\\n\\n\"off to war: voices of soldiers\\' children,\" by deborah ellis,\\n$15.95.\\n\\nthe author\\'s earlier books -- including the novel\\n\"breadwinner,\" set in afghanistan -- looked at children in foreign\\nwar-torn countries. this features interviews with the children\\nwhose parents are serving in the u.s. and canadian militaries.\\n\\nthe voices are direct responses to what seems to be a standard\\nset of questions -- how do you feel when your mother or father is in\\ncombat? how does life change when they\\'re gone? when they\\'re back?\\ndo you want to be a soldier?\\n\\nthe candid answers offer insights into a group that\\'s usually\\noverlooked in the mainstream media\\'s coverage of the military.\\n(ages 9 to 12)\\n\\n\"nation,\" by terry pratchett, $16.99.\\n\\nthis intelligent, philosophical novel examines society reborn\\nfrom the ragtag survivors of a catastrophe. this task falls to two\\nimprobable leaders, both children -- mau, the only living native of\\nan island wiped out by a tsunami, and the shipwrecked\\nermintrude/daphne -- who lead a handful of adults.\\n\\nhow they contrive to bridge linguistic, cultural and physical\\nbarriers is enterprising and often amusing. mau manages to milk a\\nwild pig to feed a newborn. both children struggle past social\\nmores -- \"does not happen!\" mutters mau when he violates a taboo --\\nto cobble together an enviable milieu. (ages 12 and up)\\n\\n\"twenty-odd ducks: why, every punctuation mark counts,\" by\\nlynn truss, illustrated by bonnie timmons, $16.99.\\n\\nin about a half-dozen examples, this droll book shows how a\\npunctuation mark can mean the difference between a blue-whale\\nexpert, who\\'s the go-to guy on blue whales, and a blue whale\\nexpert, who is either sad or whose skin is tinged blue.\\n\\nthe examples, as in the collaborators\\' previous book, \"eat\\nshoots &amp;amp; leaves,\" are witty and pointed. \"jack\\'s parents; who\\ncould be happier?\" shows two fond parents snuggling a child with a\\nperfect report card. \"jack\\'s parents, who could be happier,\"\\nhowever, shows an uneasy couple in a chaotic room where their\\nlittle snowflake is running amok.\\n\\nsometimes, punctuation means the difference between a compliment\\nand an insult:\\n\\n\"dear teacher: we want a teacher who knows what punctuation is\\nall about. you are clever. people who are not like you admit to\\nbeing horrible at grammar.\" the meaning is entirely different\\nhere: \"dear teacher: we want a teacher who knows what punctuation\\nis. all about you are clever people, who are not like you. admit to\\nbeing horrible at grammar!\" (all ages)\\n\\n\"twelve terrible things,\" by marty kelley, $16.99.\\n\\nthe lemony snicket-esque introduction advises the reader not to\\nturn the page, which is how many of us anticipate feeling the day\\nafter tuesday\\'s election. no candidates hide inside these pages,\\nbut there are one or two terrible things that could be even worse.\\n\\nkelley\\'s looming dentist says, \"say ahhh,\" instead of the\\ntruly chilling \"you might feel some discomfort.\"\\n\\nbut the birthday clown? pure evil. so are the elderly lady\\'s\\nmanicured fingernails lunging toward the reader (\"oh my goodness,\\njust look at those cheeks.\" (ages 4 to 8)\\n\\n\"the animals came two by two: the story of noah\\'s ark,\" by\\nchristopher wormell, $19.95.\\n\\nenglish wood engraver wormell\\'s minimalist illustrations are\\ninvariably striking and handsome.\\n\\nhis latest book, a simple recounting of the story about the man\\nwhose large wooden boat rescued \"two of every creature\" from the\\nultimate version of ethnic cleansing, is ravishing. pick a page,\\nany page, and it\\'s suitable for framing and hanging on the wall.\\n(ages 4 to 8)\\n\\n\"ten little fingers and ten little toes,\" by mem fox and helen\\noxenbury, $16.\\n\\nthis enchanting picture book is a gentle reminder of what nearly\\nall of us share when politics and religion are shelved. born under\\nvarious circumstances, some healthy and some not, these delightful\\nbabies and toddlers present a picture of unity and love that\\'s\\nworth emulating. (ages 4 to 8, and new grandparents)\\n\\nthe battered broadcast networks bounced back to relevance this\\npresidential election year, delivering images, buzz phrases and\\nparodies that ricocheted on the air and then endlessly around the\\nweb. ratings soared. even the driest of the tv debates outdrew the\\nrest of prime time.\\n\\nfrom the low-bar name-calling of \"the view\" to the sober colin\\npowell endorsement delivered on \"meet the press,\" with katie\\ncouric\\'s comeback interview, tina fey\\'s defining impersonation,\\ndavid letterman\\'s faux hurt feelings and a closing infomercial that\\nmay have redefined the political ad in the mix, television had a\\nheavier hand than usual in conducting the nation\\'s political\\nbusiness.\\n\\ntwenty-one months of campaign coverage felt like the world\\'s\\nlongest reality tv show. really, though, it was a collision of\\nhigh- and low-brow political, entertainment and gossip outlets\\nexploiting the campaigns to their own ends -- for humor, for web\\nhits, for ratings or partisan outrage -- and tightening the nonstop\\nnews cycle.\\n\\nbut it worked. it made tv must-see again and, it\\'s fair to say,\\nmore than ever, tv impacted the outcome of the election.\\n\\nagain and again, the campaigns mattered less than the media\\nimages of them. those of us on the couch assessed \"character\" and\\n\"temperament\" via style more than through speeches and official\\nstatements. the sight of barack obama dancing on ellen degeneres\\'\\nshow meant more to more people than his domestic policy talking\\npoints. the visual of john mccain shuffling around a televised\\n\"town hall\" registered on a deeper level than his stump speeches.\\nfey\\'s spot-on sarah palin impersonation and couric\\'s devastating\\ninterview were turning points in voters\\' minds. politics and\\nentertainment merged in what seth meyers called a \"snake eating\\nits tail moment,\" when hillary rodham clinton gave \"snl\" a\\nshout-out during a debate.\\n\\nthere was a lot of garbage, but after years of being scolded for\\nfailing to ask the tough questions, television proved its worth as\\na truth-seeking medium in the 2008 election cycle.\\n\\ntv is a great lie detector. the camera\\'s unblinking eye is\\nbetter at observing than probing, but it does eventually force\\ntruth to the surface. palin was terrific on tv, until she wasn\\'t.\\nprolonged exposure allowed the american public to move beyond\\npalin\\'s star-making turn reading a teleprompter. couric brought an\\nunrehearsed side of the candidate into focus even as the candidate\\nrailed against \"the filter of the media.\"\\n\\nsimilarly, negative ads were powerful, until they weren\\'t.\\nrepetition and truth squads allowed viewers the time to weigh and\\nreject distortions and untruths.\\n\\ntelevision made the candidates excruciatingly familiar as they\\ncamped out in our living rooms through endless debates.\\n\\ncranky or elitist? too old or too inexperienced? beyond canned\\nzingers and market-tested answers, prolonged exposure revealed\\npersonal tics, body language and style points, judged by the\\ncitizenry in record numbers.\\n\\nobama\\'s small-screen charisma boosted by eloquence was\\ninarguably telegenic. his young children likewise were made-for-tv\\ncute. some 33 million viewers caught wednesday\\'s slickly produced\\ninfomercial, designed to make obama seem at once presidential and\\nregular. his campaign proved most adept at reimagining the\\npolitical uses of television, updating the ross perot chart talk of\\n1992 with a hopeful 30-minute docu-bio-rally.\\n\\nmccain\\'s grimaces and eye rolling, apparent in close-ups during\\ndebates, and his initial reluctance to look at or engage his\\nopponent onstage, did not play well on tv. often his battle-worn\\nscreen image seemed at odds with the battle-tested words he\\nexpressed.\\n\\nthe importance of mainstream media imagery could be seen in\\nonline efforts to compare and contrast the public displays of\\naffection of the physically close obamas and the more restrained\\nmccains.\\n\\nin addition to glib talk and fist bumps, a remarkable level of\\ninformed debate was broadcast in 2008. amazingly, 50 million of us\\ngathered to hear back-and-forth on wonkish details of tax policies\\nand health plans. more amazingly, 70 million of us spent an evening\\nsizing up the vice presidential contenders. during a particularly\\nweak season of network entertainment (\"knight rider,\" anyone?),\\nwe the people chose jim lehrer,

electoral votes in new mexico, nevada and\\ncolorado would provide obama with 271 electoral votes, one more\\nthan he needs to win the white house.\\n\\nthat means that if obama wins those states, he could still\\nclinch the presidency -- even without prevailing in other\\nbattleground states like ohio and florida.\\n\\na key question is whether hispanic voters will defy historical\\ntrends and actually turn out to vote tuesday. voter participation\\nin hispanic communities has historically been lower than the\\nnational turnout, much to the consternation of hispanic political\\nactivists, who note that the group is the nation\\'s fastest growing\\nracial or ethnic demographic.\\n\\nfor example, hispanics represented 14.3 percent of the nation\\'s\\npopulation in 2004, but only cast 6 percent of the votes in that\\nyear\\'s presidential election.\\n\\nanalysts of hispanic voting patterns predict this year will be\\ndifferent and that there will be a huge turnout on tuesday. one\\nanalyst, antonio gonzalez, president of the velasquez institute, a\\nresearch organization aimed at increasing latino and other minority\\ngroups\\' political participation, predicts that hispanic voter\\nturnout will be \"record breaking.\" he notes that hispanic voter\\nregistration and voting have increased each cycle since 1980 and\\nthat efforts to register hispanic voters this year have so far\\nresulted in large registration surges.\\n\\nbrent wilkes, national executive director of the league of\\nunited latin american citizens, the nation\\'s largest latino\\npolitical organization, agreed. voter registration levels and\\npolling data indicate that turnout by hispanics will be \"huge,\"\\nhe said.\\n\\n\"all indications are that record numbers of latinos are\\nregistering to vote,\" said wilkes. \"their overall interest level\\nis higher than it was in perhaps the last three or four election\\ncycles.\"\\n\\nthe national association of latino elected and appointed\\nofficials educational fund, a leading latino leadership\\norganization, predicted that latino voter turnout on tuesday will\\nhit 9.2 million, up from 7.6 million in 2004.\\n\\na poll conducted by naleo in october showed that nearly 90\\npercent of registered hispanic voters in colorado, florida, new\\nmexico and nevada said they were \"almost certain\" they would vote\\non nov. 4.\\n\\nmccain and obama have aggressively campaigned for the hispanic\\nvote, particularly through spanish-language appeals on the issue of\\nimmigration. the obama campaign, for its part, has poured $20\\nmillion into hispanic outreach nationally.\\n\\npolls conducted in august and september by latino decisions, a\\npublic opinion firm led by matt barreto of the university of\\nwashington and gary segura of stanford university, in conjunction\\nwith naleo, showed obama leading mccain among hispanic voters in\\neach of these three states by margins of between 44 and 53 points.\\n\\nthose strong leads, coupled with the size of the hispanic\\npopulations in these states, could spell influence on election day.\\n\\nin 2006 latinos constituted 30.4 percent of registered voters in\\nnew mexico, 10 percent of registered voters in colorado and 10.2\\npercent of registered voters in nevada, according to a report led\\nby the immigration policy center, part of the american immigration\\nlaw foundation.\\n\\nstate-wide polls in october gave obama an average edge of about\\nseven points in new mexico. the illinois senator\\'s lead in colorado\\nand nevada similarly averaged at seven points at the end of\\noctober, according to real clear politics, a website that tracks\\npolling data from a variety of sources.\\n\\nan october study by the william c. velasquez institute reported\\nthat without the support of latino voters those leads would\\ndisappear -- putting obama behind mccain by four points in new\\nmexico and in a statistical tie in colorado and nevada.\\n\\nellie klerlein, field and civic engagement strategist for the\\nnational council of la raza, said that, though immigration is\\ngenerally not listed as a top issue for hispanic voters -- as with\\nmost voters, economic concerns fill that slot for hispanics -- it\\ndoes drive these individuals\\' perception of candidates.\\n\\n\"polls have shown that it\\'s something that latinos use as sort\\nof a way to get a feel for how candidates think about their\\ncommunity,\" klerlein said.\\n\\nimmigration issues in this year\\'s contest have often been just\\nbelow the surface --except in the spanish-language news media, where\\nboth the obama and mccain campaigns have slugged at each other over\\nimmigration, according to frank sharry, executive director at\\namerica\\'s voice, an organization which presses for immigration\\nreform.\\n\\none issue is the degree to which mccain will be faulted for\\nrepublican immigration policies and rhetoric that is unpopular in\\nthe hispanic community.\\n\\nin sharry\\'s view, mccain had to \"run away\" from the latino\\ncommunity during his primary campaign in order to attract his\\nparty\\'s conservative base.\\n\\nthe result, wilkes said, is that mccain has lost support from\\nlatino voters who once admired his 2006 efforts with sen. ted\\nkennedy, d-mass., at immigration reform\\n\\n\"his support couldn\\'t really overcome the negative perceptions\\nof the party,\" wilkes explained.\\n\\navoiding that negative association may be particularly important\\nin mccain\\'s efforts to win over new young latino voters and newly\\nnaturalized citizens.\\n\\nthese voters, who are new to the political process, don\\'t yet\\nhave entrenched voting patterns, said erica bernal martinez, senior\\ndirector of civic engagement at naleo.\\n\\nmccain and obama will therefore have to address issues like the\\neconomy, the war in iraq, health care and education in order to\\ngain votes from those individuals, martinez said.\\n\\n\"the latino community has matured politically. they\\'re really\\nlooking for policy decisions,\" martinez said. \"this isn\\'t about\\n\\'can someone speak to me in spanish and is that going to be enough\\nto win me over?\"\\'\\n\\n--(e-mail: allison@hearstdc.com)\\n\\nthe one certainty of tuesday\\'s national election is\\nthat a sitting senator will be elected president, marking the first\\ntime someone has gone directly from the senate to the white house\\nin almost 50 years.\\n\\nof the nation\\'s 43 presidents, the only two who were elected\\nwhile in the senate were democrat john f. kennedy in 1960 and\\nrepublican warren harding 40 years before that.\\n\\neither sen. john mccain or sen. barack obama will be only the\\nthird president to come directly from the senate in 225 years.\\n\\nhaving \"u.s. senate\" at the top of the winner\\'s resume will be\\na mixed blessing once he enters the white house, according to\\npolitical scientists and presidential historians.\\n\\n\"the senator who enters the white house thinks that he knows\\nwashington,\" said stephen hess, a presidential expert at the\\nbrookings institution, a d.c.-based think tank. \"the problem is\\nthat what he knows about washington is capitol hill.\"\\n\\na major liability for any former senator is that he can be\\nviewed as a washington insider -- a creature of the congress in\\nwhich he served -- and unable to meet the needs of states and\\neveryday people once in the white house. and the skills that\\ngenerally make good senators -- such as the ability to negotiate and\\ncompromise -- don\\'t translate to the white house, where a president\\nis often called on to be decisive.\\n\\non the campaign trail and once in the white house, senators\\n\"have been hindered by the fact that they talk in \\'senate-speak,\\'\\n\" said barry burden, a political science professor at the\\nuniversity of wisconsin, who has studied how would-be presidents in\\nthe senate. \"outside the institution, that sort of talk just\\ndoesn\\'t resonate with voters.\"\\n\\nthe winner in tuesday\\'s election can immediately capitalize on\\nhis legislative skills by taking a lead role later in november when\\ncongress reconvenes to craft another economic stimulus package. in\\nthe unique position as a sitting senator poised to become president\\non jan. 20, either mccain or obama could help write -- and even\\nintroduce -- the financial relief package congressional leaders hope\\nto debate later this month.\\n\\n\"we\\'re going to see (action) immediately, like key appointments\\n-- for the secretary of the treasury -- (and) appointing an economic\\nstimulus team,\" predicts larry berman, a professor of political\\nscience at the university of california, davis.\\n\\nthe senator-turned-president can draw on his firsthand knowledge\\nof the personalities in congress and the sometimes arcane\\nprocedural rules and traditions that can help propel a legislative\\nagenda on capitol hill or stop it in its tracks. both obama and\\nmccain would be able to capitalize on their personal connections\\nwith former colleagues in congress to push their own priorities\\nfrom the other end of pennsylvania avenue.\\n\\nthe president-elect will \"still have all the contacts (and)\\nunderstand what committees are important and can work the system\\nfrom the outside, which is really impressive and rare,\" burden\\nsaid.\\n\\nfor instance president lyndon b. johnson\\'s 12 years in the\\nsenate -- including six years running the chamber as its majority\\nleader -- gave him an advantage in pushing civil rights legislation\\nand the \"great society\" agenda during his time in the white\\nhouse. although johnson had more than a decade of experience in the\\nsenate, his launching pad to the presidency was as vice president\\nwhen kennedy was assassinated.\\n\\n\"he got an amazing amount of legislation passed because of what\\nhe knew about the senate,\" hess said.\\n\\nby contrast, former president bill clinton\\'s first big\\ninitiative -- to overhaul the nation\\'s health care system -- failed\\npartly because the former arkansas governor tried to craft it\\nwithout involving congress. a former senator would immediately know\\nsuch a move would alienate lawmakers expecting to play a key role\\nin the debate.\\n\\nthe legislative experience obama and mccain would bring to the\\npresidency would be a departure from the experience of governors\\nwho have frequently occupied the white house.\\n\\ntheir \"knowledge of the legislative process\" is a \"major\\nadvantage,\" berman said. \"governors . . . have executive\\nexperience, but it\\'s a different kind of experience.\"\\n\\nhistory shows that senators have a tough time getting elected to\\nthe white house, even for those few who were nominated.\\n\\nsince kennedy\\'s time, at least 56 sitting senators have run for\\nthe presidency, according to burden\\'s research. only a handful won\\ntheir party\\'s nomination, most recently john kerry, d-mass., in\\n2004, and former sen. robert dole, r-kan., in 1996.\\n\\nthis means that the loser in tuesday\\'s presidential contest will\\nhave plenty of company in the senate, which is filled with wannabe\\nexecutives.\\n\\nanother reason that the path from the senate to the white house\\nis rocky is that would-be presidents have amassed extensive voting\\nrecords in the chamber that can be easily picked apart on the\\ncampaign trail. opponents can make political hay out of senate\\nvotes on contentious issues.\\n\\ngovernors and other presidential aspirants don\\'t have the same\\neasy-to-attack records.\\n\\nbecause of obama\\'s limited time in the senate -- he won his seat\\nin 2004 -- he has had an advantage over mccain, a 26-year senate\\nveteran, and his main challenger in the democratic primaries, sen.\\nhillary clinton, d-n.y. both mccain and clinton cast votes\\nauthorizing the use of military force in iraq in 2002 -- before\\nobama arrived in the senate.\\n\\nsenators also can struggle to explain the nuance of their senate\\nvoting record -- especially votes that contradict each other. a\\nsenator who may be able to square a vote for a proposal with a\\nlater vote against a similar initiative may find that impossible to\\nexplain on the campaign trail. there, the vote change can be used\\nas evidence of flip-flopping.\\n\\ncase in point: four years ago, kerry was attacked for explaining\\na vote in favor of war funding by saying he voted for it before\\nvoting against it.\\n\\nsenators also are often portrayed on the campaign trail as\\nwashington insiders who are too immersed in beltway politics to\\nconnect with voters across the nation.\\n\\nboth candidates -- especially mccain -- would have to broaden\\ntheir expertise after years of being immersed in a few select areas\\nserving on individual committees in the senate.\\n\\na senator-turned-president may know a lot \"about the particular\\nareas that he specialized in (while) in the senate,\" hess said.\\n\"senators become very specialized, which means there are a lot of\\nareas in which he steps into the executive office of the president\\nin which he knows nothing.\"\\n\\nross baker, a political science professor at rutgers university,\\nsays that senators are \"fairly narrowly tracked\" -- and that\\nleaves them ill-prepared for the juggling act required of\\npresidents.\\n\\n\"as president, you have 13 responsibilities coming at you in\\nterms of various policy areas,\" baker said. \"a senator can always\\nsay, \\'i will check with my staff and get back to you.\\' a president\\ncan\\'t do that.\"\\n\\n(jennifer a. dlouhy can be

crashed\\ninto an aurora, colo., ice cream shop, killing three, including a\\n3-year-old, has helped keep the issue of illegal immigration in the\\nforefront here. but it\\'s the lingering legislative impasse in\\nwashington over immigration reform that is inspiring nonpolitical\\ntypes in colorado to join the election fray.\\n\\nhispanics are estimated to make up nearly 10 percent of the\\nstate electorate.\\n\\n\"the hispanic differential could be the decisive factor,\" said\\nfloyd ciruli, a veteran independent pollster in denver.\\n\\ncampaign officials, state and local leaders, researchers and\\nimmigrants all agreed that in colorado the issue of immigration\\nconjures deep, personal emotions that are infusing a vibrant\\npolitical discourse.\\n\\nactivists pushing for a more restrictive immigration system link\\nthe issue to economic troubles and national security concerns.\\n\\nstate sen. dave schultheis, has been a leading proponent of new\\nstate laws on illegal immigration, arguing that colorado leaders\\ncannot sit by idly until their counterparts in washington get their\\nact together and overhaul the current policy.\\n\\nthe latest census statistics show colorado is home to nearly\\n500,000 immigrants -- about half of them in the country illegally,\\naccording to the federation for american immigration reform, the\\ncountry\\'s largest anti-illegal-immigration organization.\\n\\npeople are mad, said schultheis, who represents colorado\\nsprings, the state\\'s second-largest city and a republican\\nstronghold. \"they\\'re furious over illegals stealing jobs,\\nhampering the education system and increasing crime rates.\"\\n\\nthe immigration-restrictionist argument in colorado is also\\noften linked to population growth that is threatening quality of\\nlife and the environment.\\n\\nthat\\'s a constant argument richard lamm, former democratic\\ngovernor of the state, has been making for decades. illegal\\nimmigration is driving the population explosion, said lamm, adding\\nthat the most effective solution is to systematically punish\\nemployers who profit from illegal workers.\\n\\n\"cheap labor is economic cocaine

according toamber tafoya, with the colorado immigrant\\nrights coalition.\\n\\nmany of them have relatives or friends who are in the country\\nillegally, and they\\'re among the hardest hit by the economic\\ndownturn --particularly its impact on construction.\\n\\nwhile the two candidates have remained mostly mum on the issue\\nof immigration on the campaign trail, both democratic and

professionally managed rentals promise a\\ncertain level of quality control, they don\\'t always deliver on that\\npromise. take this post by \"rjc\" from madison, wis.:\\n\\n\"in september 2007, we rented an apartment in nice, france,\\nfrom a scottish owner. upon arrival at the rental agency, before\\nthe designated time, we had to wait because the rental agent wasn\\'t\\non site and when she came, she had to run an errand. when we were\\nfinally taken to the apartment it hadn\\'t been cleaned, there was\\nrotting food, and mold, in the refrigerator, and no hot water for\\nover 18 hours. \\'these things happen,\\' we were told by the rental\\nagent. the apartment was cleaned within the next three hours, but\\nit was a rocky start to the week. correspondence to the owner after\\nreturning home was ignored. the rental agent was responsible, but\\ntook no responsibility and offered no recompense.\"\\n\\nthat\\'s not to say that rental management companies don\\'t have\\nfans.\\n\\n\"i have rented homes in several states for vacations with\\nfamily,\" wrote a reader named sue from schererville, ind. \"we\\nwould suggest only renting from a professional management company.\\nwe have been very disappointed with rentals from private\\nindividuals. just remember your idea of a clean house may not\\ncoincide with their idea of a clean house.\"\\n\\nlikewise, rental management companies had something to say about\\nthe services they provide, mostly, it seems, a dose of reality.\\n\"every owner believes his property offers something special --\\nwhich is the attitude you want an owner to have -- but the fact is,\\nthey sometimes don\\'t really notice the barking dog, the street\\nnoise, or the out-of-the-way location,\" wrote nikki hootman, who\\nwrites a newsletter for rentvillas.com, an agency specializing in\\nrentals in europe. \"the role of the agency is to evaluate the\\nproperty impartially and disclose the strengths and weaknesses\\nopenly with the client.\"\\n\\nvacation rental homeowners wrote in passionate defense of the\\nrental-by-owner market, pointing out that many of them take great\\npride in their homes and hold their rentals to high standards.\\n\\n\"with the wide use of the internet and the potential for fraud\\nand abuse, people can pretend to be anybody and sell anything,\"\\nwrote joelle miller, a vacation rental owner from pine, colo.\\n\"vacation rentals are unfortunately not excluded from possible\\ninternet scams. however, there are thousands of honest, hardworking\\nhomeowners who rent their own second home as a vacation rental and\\nmost of them are very professional.\"\\n\\nand sometimes, homeowners pointed out, it\\'s not the property\\nthat is the problem -- it\\'s the renter.\\n\\n\"not mentioned in the article: the fact that it\\'s all a two-way\\nstreet,\" wrote zachary k. \"sometimes renters ignore rules of the\\nhouse (regarding smoking, late-night noise, etc), break things\\nwithout paying or even mentioning them, etc. these folks are in the\\nminority, i think, but it just goes to show you: trust is required\\non both sides.\"\\n\\nregardless of whom you rent from, communication is the key.\\n\\n\"communicate with the agency or owner often -- let them know\\nyour priorities, ask questions and get references and

rush\\nstreets. it is the main thoroughfare of hip wicker park; then it\\ntraverses humboldt park, before heading -- like so many residents\\nwho once lived on or near it, including a few generations of my own\\nfamily -- into the suburbs.\\n\\nsolomon belo moved from lachine, quebec, to the humboldt park\\nneighborhood when he was 9. about a decade later, shortly after\\npublishing a short story called \"the hell it can\\'t\" about a\\nsavage, unexplained beating, he changed his first name to saul and\\nhis last to bellow. if the rest isn\\'t quite history, by now it\\'s\\ncertainly biography.\\n\\nlate in his life, bellow reflected on spending summer nights in\\nhumboldt park, \"on the back porch, your neighbors on their back\\nporches all down the line, the graceless cottonwoods reaching\\ntoward you and you listened to the accordions and player pianos and\\nharmonicas below, across the way, down the street, playing mazurkas\\n... one of the children was sent to the corner to bring home a\\npitcherful of soda pop (the druggist called it a phosphate). over\\nevery drugstore in chicago there swung a large mortar and pestle\\noutlined in electric bulbs and every summer the sandflies with\\ngreen light transparent wings covered the windows.\"\\n\\nthough you get the classic bellovian sense of motion at the end\\nof the passage, with the children running, sandflies beating their\\nwings against the drugstore window, the tone is calm, quiet, almost\\npastoral. it lacks augie march\\'s antic good humor, herzog\\'s\\ngenerative sense of woundedness, charlie citrine\\'s obsessing over\\nhis friend humboldt eating a pretzel while already covered with\\n\"the dust of the grave.\" but it retains (to my eye and ear, at\\nleast) an essential chicagoness -- or at least it evokes the chicago\\ni knew through my grandparents: a city of immigrants and\\nfirst-generation americans living close together, with an ear\\ncocked toward the old country (accordions, mazurkas) while running\\ntoward the new (phosphates, electric bulbs).\\n\\nthese days in much of humboldt park, you are more likely to hear\\na tight horn section than accordions, the declining syncopated\\narpeggios of a piano used in a latin band than a player piano,\\nsalsa, hip-hop or reggaeton than mazurkas. heading down division\\nstreet, from western avenue to the park itself, you pass beneath a\\nrow of abstract steel representations of the puerto rican flag\\nflying over the street. most of the signs are in spanish; the\\ngentrification that has transformed the neighboring areas of wicker\\npark, bucktown and logan square is barely a ripple here. and yet,\\nthe essential feel that bellow evokes -- a cozy, cheek-by-jowl\\nurbanity -- remains palpable. the modest but solid apartment\\nbuildings -- three flats and six flats -- lining the side streets all\\nacross chicago\\'s northwest side are snug and solid, the sorts of\\nplaces that some people use as a first american toehold and others\\nnever leave. bellow referred to the animal smells, the rawness of\\nchicago that struck him when his family first moved from lachine;\\nif the animal smells are gone -- the huge union stockyards, just\\nsouthwest of humboldt park, closed in the early 1970s, after\\ndecades of decline -- chicago\\'s rough vitality remains stronger here\\nthan almost anywhere else in the city.\\n\\nthe second house into which abraham belo moved his family is a\\nbrick three flat on cortez street. the house is on the ragged edge\\nof ukrainian village; walking along these streets you\\'ll hear\\nukrainian, russian and spanish with equal frequency. some hipsters,\\nbut not many, have started to make inroads this far west. at the\\nend of bellow\\'s old block, on the corner of cortez and western, is\\na bar called the empty bottle where the new and old communities\\nhave made a tentative accommodation: it has an old-time,\\ncorner-tavern feeling (which in this area still tends to mean\\npolish), it serves a largely latino community and in the evenings\\nit features an eclectic array of experimental jazz and rock bands,\\nalong with some of the best djs in the city. it achieves this mix\\nmatter-of-factly, unsentimentally.\\n\\nmy grandmother and her two sisters, like bellow, attended tuley\\nhigh school in humboldt park; he and my great-aunt dorothy were\\nalmost exact contemporaries, and there appears in \"more die of\\nheartbreak\" a character with their surname, vilatzer (bellow\\nspelled it \"vilitzer\"). the apocryphal family legend says that he\\nwas fond of dorothy when they were in high school, but her father,\\nelie, who owned a furniture store, shooed the dreamer away.\\n\\nbellow\\'s vilitzer was the apotheosis of a corrupt big-city pol --\\na caricature, in a sense, of elie\\'s cautious immigrant materialism.\\nharold (the big heat) vilitzer was a physically imposing city\\ncouncilman who squeezed a man\\'s head in a vise, maneuvered his\\nsister out of proceeds from a real estate sale and shunned his\\nnephew before climbing into the back of a limousine.\\n\\nperhaps as an act of rebellion -- bellow was pretty close to\\nsainthood in my secular jewish home -- i came to him late, not\\nreading a word of him until i was almost 30. i was then in the\\nmiddle of a three-year spell in london, restless and homesick, and\\ni picked up \"the adventures of augie march\" less from a burning\\ndesire to read bellow than because the mere title reminded me of\\nhome.\\n\\nof course, it took all of three sentences to hook me; the voice\\ncoming out of those pages was so strong, so familiar, and seemed to\\nbe speaking directly to me. i suppose all aesthetic loves carry\\nwith them a sense of ownership, but since then i\\'ve worked my way\\nthrough much of the rest of the canon, and there remains something\\ncategorically different -- both welcoming, almost haimishe, and a\\nlittle eerie -- in my encounters with bellow than with other authors\\ni revere.\\n\\nmy early memories are full of characters i would come to\\nrecognize (or at least call) bellovian: jewish wiseguys,\\nstreet-smart autodidacts like my grandfather, an orphan raised in\\nmilitary school who became first a professional saxophonist and\\nthen a lawyer, who taught me how to play poker when i was 6. my\\ngrandfather also read voraciously, everything he could get his\\nhands on; when he came across an unfamiliar word he wrote it on the\\nbook\\'s inside flap, then looked it up and used it as soon as he\\ncould. my grandmother could curse in yiddish and quote browning\\nfrom memory with equal felicity. art and commerce coexisted, rather\\nthan competing, in these people and in their milieu. augie, einhorn\\nand maurice spoke in their accents: adenoidal midwestern with an\\nunerasable yiddish twang.\\n\\nall of them were forged -- were made americans -- in the crucible\\nof chicago\\'s northwest side. their stories have been re-enacted\\nhundreds, thousands of times over; a more fertile writer\\'s ground\\nis difficult to imagine. naturally, bellow wasn\\'t the only writer\\npatrolling this patch of earth. nelson algren\\'s stories were mostly\\nset on the northwest side. algren memorably described a fondness\\nfor chicago as being \"like loving a woman with a broken nose, you\\nmay well find lovelier lovelies. but never a lovely so real.\"\\nstuds terkel has lived in the area since he was 8 (that\\'s 88 years\\nand counting, for those keeping score); his oral history \"division\\nstreet,\" published in 1967, tells the neighborhood\\'s stories from\\nground level.\\n\\ndivision street has always been the northwest side\\'s main\\nthoroughfare. it once held more bars per capita than any other\\nstreet in the world. today you have to hunt around a bit more -- the\\ncenter of drinking-gravity has moved a bit east, toward wicker park\\nand bucktown -- but there are still plenty of dark, quiet spots for\\nan afternoon beer and no conversation. you still see bars with old\\nstyle signs out front advertising \"zimne pivo\" (polish for \"cold\\nbeer\"), even if the drinkers are speaking spanish.\\n\\ndivision street also houses chicago\\'s last remaining russian\\nbathhouse, which inspired the greatest paragraph of chicago\\nanthropology in bellow\\'s most chicago-centric book, \"humboldt\\'s\\ngift\":\\n\\n\"the patrons of the russian bath are cast in an antique form.\\nthey have swelling buttocks and fatty breasts as yellow as\\nbuttermilk. they stand on thick pillar legs affected with a sort of\\ncreeping verdigris or blue-cheese mottling of the ankles. after\\nsteaming, these old fellows eat enormous snacks of bread and salt\\nherring or large ovals of salami and dripping skirt-steak and they\\ndrink schnapps. they could knock down walls with their hard stout\\nold-fashioned bellies. things are very elementary here. you feel\\nthat these people are almost conscious of obsolescence, of a line\\nof evolution abandoned by nature and culture. so down in the\\nsuper-heated subcellars all these

(weekend in new york\\ndoes not endorse such activity but did not want to restrict her\\nfreedom of speech, so will note that she got a $3,400 louis vuitton\\npurse (or something like one) for $80.\\n\\na young couple from zaragoza, spain, said that what made their\\ntrip was the decision to stay in the st. marks hotel in the east\\nvillage, as opposed to a more traditional midtown location. \"the\\nst. marks is not a grand hotel,\" said jesus longares, a\\n32-year-old engineer. \"but it is in a fascinating area. there are\\nmany contrasts. you can see a store specializing in comics, and\\nthen a boutique for goths.\"\\n\\nsometimes, popular destinations yield unexpected highlights.\\nmircea bucecu and gwen groom, who were visiting from vancouver,\\nrecommended ground zero, but not for the typical reasons. they were\\nchilled and touched not so much by the site itself, but by the\\nnear-silence of their fellow visitors. \"i couldn\\'t believe that,\"\\nsaid bucecu, 62. \"usually it\\'s a noisy town. if someone was\\ntalking, they were whispering.\"\\n\\ngroom, 54, cited another characteristic new york is not known\\nfor. \"there was a sense of humbleness there,\" she said.\\n\\nmost travelers had to ponder their decision a bit, but not vasco\\nkrapchev. krapchev, a seasoned traveler and molecular virologist\\nwho was born in bulgaria and lives in poland, recently spent four\\ndays visiting a childhood friend in new york. his call: drinking at\\nideya, a cozy bar and restaurant serving modern latin cuisine in\\nsoho. he recommended the bar scene between 10 p.m. and midnight on\\nfriday or saturday nights. \"great mojitos and caipirinhas,\" he\\nsaid. \"top 10 of where i\\'ve been for sure. maybe top five.\"\\n(note: a vigorous test of his recommendation proved he was on the\\nmark.)\\n\\nhe was not impressed with the food, although he may have drunk\\ntoo much to taste it, as evidenced by his difficulty in recalling\\nhow long he stayed. in the end, he resorted to an alternative form\\nof measurement:\\n\\n\"we spent four caipirinhas there,\" he said. \"so probably\\nthree hours.\"\\n\\nthais mucher, a brazilian woman traveling with her sister\\njuliana -- both in their 20s -- was amazed that in new york, she\\ncould eat tapas under such elegant lighting at pipa. \"during the\\nday, it\\'s a store that sells crystal chandeliers,\" she said --\\nthat\\'s abc carpet &amp;amp; home. \"at night, they put in tables. it\\'s\\nreally awesome.\" the dozens of chandeliers hanging from the\\nceiling -- along with the mirrors on the wall -- are for sale. the\\nsisters mucher weren\\'t tempted; they stuck with the sangria.\\n\\nher sister fell into another category of traveler: those who\\nrecommended things new yorkers and frequent visitors take for\\ngranted. in her case, it was the concept of brunch. \"in sao paulo,\\nit\\'s just lunch,\" she said. \"here, brunch is really delicious.\"\\nshe recommended the beef sandwich with caramelized onions and\\ngruyere at bistro citron on the upper west side.\\n\\nin the same category was peggy minnich from ventura county,\\ncalifornia, who was with her husband, richard. her simple\\nrecommendation: the subway as tourist attraction. \"coming from\\nl.a.,\" she said, \"we don\\'t have public transportation. it\\'s an\\nexperience in and of itself. it connects you to the city in a way\\nthat nothing else does.\"\\n\\nrichard minnich was slightly less complimentary, calling the\\nsubway filthy.\\n\\n\"use the word \\'earthy,\\' perhaps,\" peggy minnich said.\\n\\nthe recommendation of trish and chris skillman, who were in town\\nfor the weekend from clinton, n.j., with their 14-year-old,\\nheather, and her friend lauren folsom, was not to plan at all. \"i\\nwould come in with absolutely nothing particular in mind and just\\npick and choose as the mood strikes,\" said chris skillman. almost\\nnothing in mind, that is: every time they visit, heather insists\\nthat they go to john\\'s pizzeria near times square. her\\nrecommendation: the sausage and fennel petes-a-rolls and a glance\\nat the stained glass skylight that looks like a pizza.\\n\\nfinding braised rabbit\\n\\nsampling of new york tourist favorites\\n\\nkefi, 222 w. 79th st., between broadway and amsterdam avenue;\\n(212) 873-0200.

(he also owns several\\nresidences.) \"we\\'re talking about a bunch of 20-year-old guys,\"\\nhe continued, referring to his father\\'s band, the drifting cowboys.\\n\"he would sign autographs and they would come up behind him with a\\nstink bomb.\"\\n\\nthe exhibition, \"family tradition: the williams family\\nlegacy,\" depicts the lives of three generations, from hank and his\\nwife, audrey, to hank jr.\\'s five children, and features items like\\nthe 1944 martin d-28 guitar on which williams wrote many of his\\nhits. the scotch-taped scrapbooks that hank\\'s mother kept during\\nhis rise to fame are presented alongside touch-screen recreations\\nof their contents. there are candid family photos from the late\\n1940s, home movies of a trip to disneyland and a snapshot, taken\\ndecades later, of a young hank williams iii taking a bath with his\\nhalf-sisters holly and hilary. (all three now sing professionally.)\\nthe singer jett williams, hank sr.\\'s daughter from his brief affair\\nwith bobbie jett, is also a subject of the exhibition.\\n\\noriginally preserved on 16-inch acetate discs, the 143\\ntranscriptions included in \"the unreleased recordings\" -- the\\nfirst 54 of which were released last week -- nearly double hank\\nwilliams\\' recorded output. the music was rescued from a dumpster in\\nthe late 1980s by an employee of wsm-am, the nashville radio\\nstation on which the songs were originally broadcast, on an early\\nmorning program sponsored by mother\\'s best flour company, in 1951.\\nthe decision about what should be done with the transcriptions was\\ndelayed by protracted litigation over the williams estate.\\n\\nthe recordings greatly expand what we know of williams\\' persona\\nand repertory. we hear him not only exulting in the pleasures of\\nmaking music, but also clowning with his band and crooning old\\nhymns like \"softly and tenderly\" and victorian parlor ballads\\nlike \"the blind child\\'s prayer.\"\\n\\n\"what the mother\\'s best flour shows reveal is that hank was a\\nfully fleshed-out man, with a silly sense of humor, deep religious\\nfaith and a sentimental side that comes off as borderline cheesy\\ntoday,\" said brenda colladay, curator of the grand ole opry museum\\nin nashville. \"this isn\\'t the tortured, tragic genius who died in\\nthe back seat of a cadillac. this is the hank who can\\'t quite\\nbelieve he is playing on wsm radio, has a closet full of custom\\nsuits, a string of hit records and a beautiful blond wife sitting\\nnext to him as he steers that cadillac toward his dream house.\"\\n\\nin one touching between-song segment, williams promises young\\nbocephus -- his nickname for hank jr. -- that he\\'ll be home for\\nbreakfast to \"sop biscuits\" with him. williams had just reached\\nnew heights in popularity, including appearances on national\\ntelevision programs like \"the perry como show\" and being billed\\nabove bob hope and milton berle on the touring hadacol caravan.\\nnevertheless, the eagerness in his voice at the prospect of being\\nhome with his family is palpable.\\n\\nhank jr. was only 3 1/2 when his father died, and he remembers\\nlittle of their time together. nearly eight years his senior, hank\\njr.\\'s half-sister lycrecia williams hoover has more firsthand\\nmemories of what williams was like.\\n\\n\"of the two of us, i always considered myself the luckiest one\\nbecause i got to do things with daddy,\" said hoover, 67, a\\ndignified woman with intense blue eyes. a stay-at-home mom much of\\nher life, hoover, who today works part time in a beauty shop, spoke\\nfrom the patio of her home in rural bon aqua, tenn., about 40 miles\\nfrom nashville.\\n\\n\"daddy was a fun person,\" she said. \"he would take me bowling\\na lot. he would go horseback riding and fishing with me. i just\\nfeel like hank jr. missed out on so much.\"\\n\\naudrey williams\\' daughter from an earlier marriage, hoover\\nwasn\\'t enthusiastic about the prospect of another retrospective\\nabout her stepfather when representatives of the museum in\\nnashville contacted her about the project. she doesn\\'t shy away\\nfrom talking about her parents\\' \"fussing and fighting,\" or about\\nhank\\'s darker side or drinking. she was, however, wary of yet\\nanother tabloid treatment of the williams legacy.\\n\\n\"they said, \\'we promise you this is not going to be like the\\nothers,\"\\' she said.\\n\\nparticularly welcome, hoover said, is the museum\\'s depiction,\\nthrough telegrams and other documents, of her mother\\'s career as a\\nbusinesswoman. audrey married hank in 1944, at a gas station near\\nandalusia, ala. after playing a critical role in helping her\\nhusband start his career, audrey, a performer who has often been\\nportrayed as conniving and shrill, went on to become a successful\\nsong publisher and movie producer. in 1964 she was a founder of\\naud-lee attractions, nashville\\'s oldest privately owned talent\\nagency (now called buddy lee attractions).\\n\\n\"had it not been for mother, i just don\\'t think daddy would\\nhave gotten to nashville, unless somebody else could of got a hold\\nof him and pushed,\" hoover said. \"daddy, he liked to entertain.\\nhe was a genius, but mother was the mastermind behind getting him\\nwhere he needed to be.\"\\n\\ncarolyn tate, the curator, with michael mccall, of the family\\ntradition exhibition, stresses the importance of putting audrey\\'s\\naccomplishments in historical context. \"she was a single mom in\\nthe mid-\\'50s,\" tate said. \"she was left to run a business and\\nraise children and to deal with a lot of legal issues.\"\\n\\ndespite her business acumen, audrey died bankrupt, in 1975,\\nafter years of struggling with addiction to alcohol and other\\ndrugs. \"after daddy passed away, mother blamed herself,\" hoover\\nsaid. \"she loved him and felt like she should have been able to\\nkeep him from drinking. later, little by little, she began to\\ndrink, until she became an alcoholic too.\" audrey and hank\\nwilliams divorced in july 1952, less than six months before hank\\'s\\ndeath.\\n\\nthe exhibition also plots lesser-known points in the trajectory\\nof hank jr.\\'s career. initially cast as his father\\'s imitator, hank\\njr. transformed himself into a raucous country-rocker, fusing his\\nfather\\'s blues-steeped honky-tonk with disparate influences to\\ncreate a new southern hybrid.\\n\\n\"to see me, at 13 and 14 years old with the wavy jellyroll hair\\nand the white stratocaster, it all comes together,\" said hank jr.,\\nwho was born randall hank williams, recalling his days leading a\\ncombo called rockin\\' randall and the rockets. \"i\\'d go out on the\\nroad and be hank williams sr. and come back home and be rockin\\'\\nrandall. that\\'s how i would do it -- two worlds. and guess what?\\nrockin\\' randall consumed the other guy. my cloning days were\\nover.\"\\n\\nhank jr.\\'s son, hank williams iii (born shelton hank williams),\\n35, has felt the burden of his birthright too. in his case, this\\nhas meant pressure to differentiate himself not just from his\\nfather but also from his grandfather, to whom he bears an uncanny\\nphysical and vocal resemblance.\\n\\n\"i\\'m almost following in the same footsteps as my dad, but\\ninstead of skynyrd, i\\'ve been into pantera and david allan coe and\\nbands like that,\" he said of his assortment of country, punk and\\nheavy metal. \"the energy\\'s just different.\"\\n\\nthe most emblematic items in the exhibition from hank iii\\'s\\ncareer are his duct-taped cowboy boots. hank iii, whose album\\n\"damn right, rebel proud\" (curb records) was released on oct. 21,\\nestimates that before loaning them to the museum, he had worn them\\nfor as many as 4,000 consecutive performances.\\n\\ncropping up again and again in the exhibition is the struggle of\\nwilliams family members to define themselves as inheritors of hank\\nsr.\\'s legacy while also striving to preserve some semblance of\\nnormality. most telling is a photo from the late \\'50s in which\\nhoover and her brother and mother are playing in the snow in front\\nof their ranch-style home in nashville.\\n\\n\"people don\\'t understand that part -- a kid with his sister and\\nhis mother,\" hank jr. said, referring to the scene in the photo.\\n\\n\"it\\'s real normal, yeah, until this big bus comes by with all\\nthese tourists, and as this little bitty kid i think, \\'why are they\\nstopping there?\\' and then it hits you. that\\'s why they\\'re stopping\\nthere.\"\\n\\nit took two years of high-level negotiations to arrange\\na meeting with daniel craig. in an era when mi6 -- the agency that\\nemploys his best-known character, james bond -- blithely advertises\\nfor agents on the internet, craig may well be the world\\'s most\\nelusive pretend spy.\\n\\nthe long wait allowed plenty of time for disturbing rumors to\\nmarinate. for instance: he is surly and defensive, a\\nreporter-averse utterer of combative monosyllables. or this, from\\ntwo women working on his publicity: he has more sexual magnetism\\nthan anyone we have ever met.\\n\\nperhaps nothing short of craig\\'s materializing in his snug\\npowder-blue bathing trunks from \"casino royale\" and offering to\\nshake the martinis himself could have realistically lived up to all\\nthat anticipation.\\n\\nbut there he was in jeans, his arm in a sling from recent\\nshoulder surgery. he was wearing a thick cardigan that, truth be\\ntold, walked a sensitive line between doofusy and stylish. he was,\\nof course, unfairly attractive anyway, in his craggy, lived-in,\\nblue-eyed way, but not so much as to render anyone speechless or\\nunable to operate a notebook.\\n\\nhe was polite to a fault. he stood up when his publicist\\'s\\nassistant brought in a cup of tea. he apologized several times for\\nbeing five minutes late. he acted as if he were not sitting in a\\nsoulless conference room, which he was, and as if he had all day to\\nchat about bond and other interesting topics, which he didn\\'t. (he\\nhad an hour.)\\n\\nunlike many movie stars who come to believe the myth of their\\nsuperiority, craig, 40, tends to mock his own celebrity. now that\\nhe is too famous to go to the movies without being recognized, he\\nsaid, he might be forced to install a screening room at home. not.\\n\"i could stick it next to the indoor swimming pool,\" he said\\nsarcastically.\\n\\npassing beneath two celebratory posters of himself as james bond\\nin his publicist\\'s office here, he grimaced and muttered, \"that\\'s\\nmy dorian gray portrait.\" asked whether he saw himself as a\\nnatural leading man, he said, \"fat chance.\" and then, \"there\\'s\\nnot a skin-care product in the world that would have made that\\nhappen for me.\"\\n\\nwhen he was cast as bond, filling the position most recently\\nvacated by pierce brosnan, craig did not seem like an obvious\\nchoice. he was an actor\\'s actor known for his intensity of focus\\nand his wide range of challenging, counterintuitive roles. he has\\nplayed, among other things, a sharp-lapeled pornography baron from\\nmanchester in the bbc miniseries \"our friends in the north\"; a\\ncollege professor pursued by a male stalker in \"enduring love\"; a\\nbuilder sleeping with his girlfriend\\'s sexagenarian mother in \"the\\nmother\"; a drug-dealing businessman in \"layer cake\"; a killer\\nfull of murderous rage and heartbreaking tenderness in\\n\"infamous\"; and the poet ted hughes in \"sylvia.\"\\n\\n\"everybody said, \\'oh, aren\\'t you afraid you\\'ll be typecast?\\' \"\\nhe recalled of taking the bond role. \"and i said, \\'of course i\\nam,\\' but if it has to be this -- well, that\\'s not too bad.\"\\n\\ntraditionalists were appalled. the british tabloids, whose\\nwriters possibly had not seen craig in his other films, sniped that\\nhe was too short, too blond, too actory, too potentially\\nlazenbyesque; they spread the rumor that he didn\\'t know how to\\ndrive a stick shift, let alone one attached to an aston martin.\\n\\nbut from the first scene in \"casino royale\" (2006), in which\\nbond brutally kills a man with his bare hands and then coolly\\nshoots and kills his own corrupt boss, craig proved to be a rare\\ncombination of plausibility, physicality and charisma. he got rave\\nreviews, and not just from bond\\'s traditional fan base.\\n\\nthe latest movie, \"quantum of solace,\" which opens nov. 14, is\\nfull of the usual bondian big guns, big explosions, big-busted\\nwomen and big, improbable, high-testosterone stunts, many of them\\nperformed by craig. while he bulked up for \"casino\" -- he wanted\\nto \"look as if he could kill people just by looking at them,\" his\\npersonal trainer, a former royal navy commando, said recently -- in\\nthis film he focused on building up his stamina, going for lean and\\nmean over brawn.\\n\\n(craig was recently quoted in the times of london as saying, \"i\\nam not an athlete, although i have always enjoyed keeping fit\\nbetween bouts of minor alcoholism.\")\\n\\ncraig said that he had been determined to ensure that the story\\nmade logical and emotional sense. \"quantum\" begins moments after\\n\"casino\" ends, with bond, wielding an enormous firearm, on the\\nisland where he has just shot one of the men responsible for the\\ndeath of vesper lynd, the treacherous love of his life.\\n\\n\"they\\'re two separate movies, but if you were to punish\\nyourself by watching them back to back, you\\'d see a through line,\"\\ncraig said. he particularly wanted bond to have to contend with the\\nemotional repercussions of vesper\\'s death.\\n\\n\"it was very important that we deal with that,\" he said. \"i\\njust felt that you can\\'t have a character fall in love so madly as\\nthey did in the last movie and not finish it off, understand it,\\nget some closure. that\\'s why the movie is called \\'quantum of\\nsolace\\' -- that\\'s exactly what he\\'s looking for.\"\\n\\nhe added: \"by the end of \\'solace,\\' there\\'s a conclusion that\\ni\\'m hoping will set us up, if all goes well, for a third movie. and\\nwe can set it someplace warm and quiet.\" (he was kidding, he said,\\nabout the \"quiet\" part.)\\n\\nlast fall he and the director of \"quantum of solace,\" marc\\nforster, set out to fill in the gaps in the script, left incomplete\\nbecause of the hollywood writers\\' strike. forster said he was\\nstruck by how much craig wanted to get the story right and ensure\\nthat his interpretation of bond was \"not just a cliche, but a\\ncharacter that people can connect to.\"\\n\\nhe added: \"he\\'s very shy and slightly modest and humble, and he\\ndoesn\\'t like to be the center of attention. it\\'s more like, \\'let\\'s\\nmake good movies and tell a good story and do a good job.\\' \"\\n\\nalong with \"quantum,\" craig is appearing this fall in\\n\"defiance\" (set to open dec. 31), based on the true story of the\\nbielskis, a trio of freedom-fighting jewish brothers in world war\\nii. defying the nazis (and the odds), they set up an unlikely\\ncommunity of tough, armed refugees in the punishing belarussian\\nforest. craig plays tuvia, their complicated leader -- sometimes\\nhot-headed, sometimes coolly rational; now seeking revenge, now\\npreaching restraint.\\n\\nthe shoot was tough. the actors had to speak russian in a number\\nof scenes; they also had to live more or less in the woods, in\\nsometimes extreme frigid conditions, for three months. most of the\\ncast came down with some sort of bronchial flu, craig said, \"but\\nwhen we started drinking more, it seemed to get better.\"\\n\\nthe director of \"defiance,\" edward zwick, said it was\\ninteresting to watch craig take on the role, with all its\\nambivalence and inner conflict, in tandem with playing the\\nself-assured bond.\\n\\n\"you see very clearly his ambition as an actor; he refuses to\\nbe just one thing,\" zwick said in a telephone interview. \"what\\nyou have to understand about daniel is that he is a working actor\\nwho considers himself that. he began in the theater and did all\\nsorts of ensemble work, and in some ways this was a territory in\\nwhich he\\'s more comfortable than in being the star who\\'s out in\\nfront of the movie.\"\\n\\ncraig grew up in liverpool and spent much of his spare time\\nwatching movies, sometimes by himself, in a small cinema down the\\nstreet from his house. he left home as a teenager to seek his\\nfortune as an actor in london. he worked with the national youth\\ntheater, went to drama school and began being cast as romantic\\nleads, a designation he brushes aside.\\n\\nwith each part, he explained, \"i said to myself: \\'romantic lead\\n-- what is he? is he an alcoholic? what\\'s his deal? what\\'s his\\nproblem?\\' for me, that has always been the way. that\\'s what i did\\nfor bond and what i try and do with everything.\"\\n\\nhe is determined to continue pursuing extra-bond roles.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve been so fortunate to land this amazing role in a huge\\nfranchise,\" he said. \"it\\'s set me up in a really good way for\\nlife, and that\\'s wonderful. but i love acting, and i genuinely\\nthink it\\'s an important part of what life is about. i get a kick\\nout of it, and i\\'m not good at sitting around.\"\\n\\ncraig, who has a teenage daughter from an early marriage,\\ngenuinely seems more interested in talking about other topics -- the\\nbooks of philip pullman; the exciting-to-him proposition of barack\\nobama being elected president; movies he likes -- than he does in\\ntalking about himself.\\n\\nbut he mentioned his longtime american girlfriend, satsuki\\nmitchell, with whom he lives in los angeles and london. he wears a\\nsilver necklace inscribed with a quotation \"about taking your\\nheart wherever you go,\" he said when asked, sounding suddenly shy.\\n\\nrecently, he said, the two drove up the american west coast,\\nthrough to the pacific northwest. they ducked into a small-town\\nmovie theater to see the guillermo del toro movie \"hellboy ii: the\\ngolden army.\"\\n\\nsomeone approached craig.\\n\\n\"has anyone ever told you you look like daniel craig?\" the man\\nasked.\\n\\n\"no,\" craig answered, and walked on.\\n\\nthe details don\\'t really matter. what matters is that a few\\nyears before his screenplays for \"the queen\" and \"the last king\\nof scotland\" propelled him to the head of the class, peter morgan\\nwas so fed up that he was ready to try anything -- anything! -- that\\nwasn\\'t a film script.\\n\\nhe considered bungee jumping and mountain climbing, he said not\\nlong ago from his home in london. but he chose something even\\nriskier. he wrote a play about the landmark 1977 television\\ninterviews that david frost conducted with richard m. nixon.\\nrelying on the accounts of participants and fictionalizing here and\\nthere for effect, he made sure to write it, he said, \"in a way\\nthat breaks every single rule of screenwriting.\"\\n\\n\"frost/nixon\" was picked up by the small but prestigious\\ndonmar warehouse, where the director michael grandage and the\\ndesigner christopher oram incorporated onstage video screens to\\nallow close-ups of michael sheen\\'s unctuous, eager-beaver frost and\\nfrank langella\\'s sly, subtly decomposing nixon. morgan loved the\\neffect. but, he recalled, it gave him pause: \"i hope people don\\'t\\nmake the mistake of thinking this has any sort of filmic life in it\\nwhatsoever.\"\\n\\nthat was then. now, for all of morgan\\'s determination to make it\\nimpossible, \"frost/nixon\" the movie is scheduled to open on dec.\\n5, right in time for the hollywood awards season. directed by ron\\nhoward, whose previous forays into 20th-century history include the\\noscar-winning \"beautiful mind\" and the oscar-nominated \"apollo\\n13,\" the film retains the stage production\\'s acclaimed star\\nperformances, its often verbatim re-creations of interviews that\\nranged from droning wonkishness to high-stakes drama and its eerily\\nfamiliar litany of military disasters abroad and assertions of\\npresidential power at home.\\n\\nmorgan never intended to write a play about george w. bush, the\\niraq war and government spying, he said. \"frost/nixon\" had been\\ngestating since 1993, and when he realized that \"people were\\nseeing inferences and parallels,\" he \"went back to the play and\\nthrew stuff out.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m thrilled that it has a contemporary resonance,\" he said,\\n\"but i\\'d be perfectly happy if it didn\\'t. i didn\\'t want the\\nfrost-nixon play to be seen as a metaphor for bush-blair. i hate\\nwhen i\\'m an audience member and i\\'m being led. because why write\\nabout bush when you can write about nixon?\"\\n\\nit would be hard to overstate the hold richard m. nixon still\\nexerted on the public imagination in 1977, when david frost paid\\nhim ($1 million, ultimately) to sit in front of a television camera\\nand answer questions, at last, about the reasons behind his\\nignominious resignation in 1974. with a cobbled-together production\\nteam, an oddly assorted collection of sponsors and an ad hoc\\nnetwork of independent stations, frost pulled off a coup at once\\nhistoric, journalistic and financial. the first installment of what\\neventually became a five-part package was seen by an astounding 45\\nmillion viewers (the same number, noted john j. o\\'connor,\\ntelevision critic for the new york times, who sat down every week\\nto watch \"happy days,\" the hit sitcom starring a young actor\\nnamed ron howard).\\n\\nstill, there\\'s no question that the resounding success of\\n\"frost/nixon\" was due in part to its implicit analogy between the\\nmisdeeds that drove nixon from power and more recent events. and\\neven before the play moved from the donmar to the west end, morgan\\nwas besieged by directors -- including martin scorsese, george\\nclooney and sam mendes -- wanting to turn it into a film. \"i had\\nthese mixed emotions,\" he said. \"i thought, on the one hand all\\nthe people i most admire in the world seem to be interested. but\\nthe secret that i can\\'t share with any of them is, as a mechanic,\\nthe motor won\\'t work. the car is not roadworthy.\"\\n\\nwhen howard first heard about the play, he said, it didn\\'t\\nimmediately suggest a movie to him either. \"but i was surprised\\nwhen i read it and even more compelled by the performance i saw at\\nthe donmar,\" he remembered. \"i just had a connection with the\\nmaterial and a feeling about how to adapt it. i just wanted to do\\nit.\"\\n\\nhoward\\'s partner at imagine entertainment, brian grazer, was\\nalso tentative at first. \"after 30 years of being a producer,\" he\\nsaid, \"i never know.\" but he was intrigued by morgan\\'s portrait\\nof two opposites -- the humbled, ill-at-ease ex-president and the\\nambitious, charming talk-show host -- both exploiting television to\\nfurther their own ends.\\n\\nmorgan went with howard as director partly because he thought\\nhoward\\'s track record would reassure skittish moviegoers that\\n\"frost/nixon\" would be entertaining. an indication of just how\\nskittish they might be, morgan said, was the difficulty of enticing\\npeople into test screenings. \"if you go into a mall and say,\\n\\'would you like to come and see a film about the interviews done by\\ndavid frost and richard nixon in 1977?\"\\' he noted, \"they just\\nwalk past you. they think you\\'re mad.\"\\n\\nbecause \"frost/nixon\" would be a hard sell, a big-time movie\\nstar for the juicy role of nixon seemed an inevitability. for\\nlangella, who had, by his own admission, struggled to find his way\\ninto the character, it was disappointing, but not surprising. \"the\\nstory out there is that i was waiting and waiting and waiting,\"\\nlangella said. but he knew even before the production moved from\\nthe donmar to the west end that the role would be going to jack\\nnicholson, he said. and by the time langella was on broadway, en\\nroute to the best actor tony award, he knew warren beatty would be\\nnixon on film. \"i had accepted the fact that i wasn\\'t going to\\nplay him,\" langella said.\\n\\nmeanwhile, the producers were coming to the opposite conclusion.\\n\"when you start with a blank canvas,\" said eric fellner of\\nworking title films, the co-producer of \"frost/nixon,\" \"you\\nthink there are many other ways of going. but by the time the\\ndecision actually had to be made, it was quite clear there were no\\nother ways of going.\"\\n\\nthe plan had always been to cast sheen, who had so memorably\\nplayed tony blair in \"the queen.\" and, howard said, there had\\nnever been any doubt in his own mind that langella \"would be\\ngreat.\"\\n\\n\"ultimately,\" he said, \"it became quite apparent that anyone\\nelse doing the role would be walking in frank\\'s shadow.\"\\n\\nbut there were other problems. morgan\\'s play had all those\\nuncinematic elements he had taken such pains to incorporate. there\\nwere two narrators, aides to the title characters, speaking\\ndirectly to the audience. there was a plotline, wholly dependent on\\nthe progress of the interviews themselves, that developed largely\\nin a single room. and the story\\'s climax -- the wished-for admission\\nfrom nixon that yes, he had \"let the american people down\" -- came\\nwith the two antagonists immobilized in matching easy chairs.\\n\\nhoward was not concerned. \"i think the tight quarters and the\\nintensity, particularly in the second half, are a huge dramatic\\nasset,\" he said, citing his experience making the even more\\nclaustrophobic \"apollo 13.\" \"and i felt that there were ways of\\nopening it up that didn\\'t have anything to do with scope and scale,\\nexpanding it through detail, through broadening the secondary\\ncharacters, through utilizing the television medium and just\\nthrough the camerawork and the editing.\" another touchstone was\\nhoward\\'s \"cinderella man,\" about the boxer james braddock: \"i\\nrealized how much could be divulged through the reaction of the\\npeople in the corners.\"\\n\\nto inhabit those corners, he cast a constellation of first-class\\nactors. kevin bacon plays jack brennan, the staunch military aide\\nwho followed nixon from the white house to become his chief of\\nstaff in california. on the opposing side are sam rockwell as james\\nreston jr., frost\\'s impassioned researcher for the watergate\\nsegment; oliver platt as bob zelnick, the hard-nosed reporter\\nresearching the other interview topics; and matthew macfadyen as\\njohn birt, the program\\'s skilled british producer.\\n\\nin the play, brennan and reston provide running commentary as\\nfrost and nixon arrange for combat and then go mano a mano. morgan\\nthought the dueling narrators would have to be dropped from the\\nmovie; howard suggested augmenting brennan and reston with even\\nmore narrators, all recounting their recollections for a television\\ndocumentary.\\n\\nof course, those recollections don\\'t exactly match the memories\\nof the actual players in the drama. frost, whose current interview\\nprogram, \"frost over the world,\" runs on al-jazeera english,\\nscoffed at his characterization as a lightweight celebrity-chaser,\\nticking off a long list of the presidents and prime ministers he\\nhad already interviewed when he took on nixon.\\n\\nken khachigian, the lead researcher for the nixon team (which\\nincluded a young diane sawyer), echoed that point. \"we viewed\\nfrost as a tough adversary,\" he said. \"we did our homework.\\nthere\\'s a picture in my office of our briefing books -- about 30 or\\n35 briefing books piled high on nixon\\'s desk.\"\\n\\nkhachigian and brennan both take issue with morgan\\'s most\\nfanciful invention, the scene in which a drunken nixon calls frost\\nin the middle of the night and confides a secret anguish. \"he was\\nnot capable of holding drinks,\" brennan said of nixon. \"he knew\\nthat. any time we went to a party, for example, i would tell the\\nbartender, \\'if one of his big buddies comes over and says he wants\\na scotch for dick nixon, just give him blond dubonnet.\"\\' brennan\\nsaid he told morgan, \"you could have made your point without the\\npresumption of alcoholism.\"\\n\\nreston, who had provided morgan with a 30-year-old account of\\nhis time on the frost team (now published as \"the conviction of\\nrichard nixon\"), was somewhat surprised by his portrayal as a hot\\nyoung radical. \"i was the quiet one who did all the work,\" he\\nsaid. like brennan, he hadn\\'t yet seen the movie, though both men\\nhad met with and been impressed by their film surrogates before\\nshooting began. as for zelnick, when he met his screen counterpart,\\nhe said, he advised the much-taller platt to play him on his knees.\\n\\nmorgan makes no apologies for his distortions of the facts.\\n\"whose facts?\" he asked. interviewing the interviewers, he said,\\nhad taught him \"what a complete farce history is.\"\\n\\n\"these were all people that were in the room at the same\\ntime,\" he marveled, \"and they couldn\\'t agree on a thing.\"\\n\\nas the legions of teenagers who have read the novel on which the\\nforthcoming film \"twilight\" is based know, the awkward passage\\nfrom youth to maturity isn\\'t the very worst problem an adolescent\\ncan have. you could fall helplessly in love with a vampire, which\\nis what happens to the virginal 17-year-old heroine and narrator of\\nstephenie meyer\\'s book.\\n\\n\"we\\'ve all had the experience of being that age and feeling\\nthat everything is life and death,\" said melissa rosenberg, who\\nwrote the screenplay. \"you know, \\'i have nothing to wear today,\\ni\\'m going to kill myself.\\' what\\'s so wonderful about this story is\\nthat everything actually is life and death.\"\\n\\nthe transition from page to screen is itself often a less than\\ngraceful process, and while it\\'s rarely a matter of life and death,\\nit can give filmmakers that adolescent sense of unease: \"if this\\nmovie tanks, i\\'m going to kill myself.\" there\\'s no denying that in\\nthe case of \"twilight\" the stakes (so to speak) are high. the\\nfour novels in meyer\\'s horror/romance series for young adults --\\n\"twilight\" was the first -- have sold somewhere near 10 million\\ncopies; the most recent, \"breaking dawn,\" racked up sales of 1.3\\nmillion on its first day in bookstores in august. and fans are on\\nthe rabid side. \"there\\'s all this stuff online,\" said the film\\'s\\ndirector, catherine hardwicke. \"people were making casting\\nsuggestions, and now they\\'re doing their own trailers and posters.\\nit\\'s stimulating, in a way.\"\\n\\na particular hazard with books like meyer\\'s -- or like j.k.\\nrowling\\'s harry potter novels -- is that younger readers, unlike\\ntheir more jaded elders, tend to like their stories just so, with\\nas little variation as possible. and as any adult who has ever read\\nbedtime stories to children understands, when youngsters really go\\nfor a story, they\\'ll insist on hearing it again and again, which is\\nwhy movies aimed at children, tweens and teenagers can have such a\\nhuge payoff for producers and distributors. two words: repeat\\nbusiness.\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t want to be the screenwriter who disappointed all\\nthose readers,\" rosenberg said. \"nor did catherine, i\\'m sure,\\nwant to be the director who did so.\"\\n\\nhardwicke said that when she was approached about directing\\n\"twilight,\" she was handed a script that she later realized was\\n\"very, very different from the book.\" soon after, \"i read the\\nnovel myself and i thought, let\\'s get back to this story, it\\'s\\njust so much better.\"\\n\\nneither would admit to feeling any constraints on her creativity\\nfrom the readers\\' demands for fidelity to the novel. \"my biggest\\nproblem was how to condense,\" rosenberg said. clearly, the\\nstrategy is to swear undying fealty to the book and hope the fans\\nwill be merciful.\\n\\nand what, exactly, is this story to which the makers of\\n\"twilight\" (opening nov. 21) have plighted their troth? it\\'s the\\ntale of a bright girl named bella swan who moves to the gloomy town\\nof forks, wash., and on her first day at school meets, across a\\ncrowded cafeteria, the eyes of a mysterious classmate named edward\\ncullen, whom she describes as \"devastatingly, inhumanly\\nbeautiful.\"\\n\\nedward is a little standoffish, but bella falls for him hard,\\nwhile remaining somewhat puzzled by his unteenage-boy-like sexual\\nrestraint. he\\'s determined to keep a tight rein on his impulses,\\nwhich include, in addition to the usual ones, a powerful yen to\\nfeed on his new admirer\\'s blood. when she discovers his secret, she\\nisn\\'t quite sure how to, you know, feel about this unnerving kink\\nin his personality, but soon decides that being a vampire\\'s\\nsignificant other is preferable to depriving herself of this\\nreally, really good-looking guy\\'s company. he remains a perfect\\ngentleman, she a well-behaved lady and their fatal attraction stays\\n(at least in the first novel) unconsummated.\\n\\nmeyer goes to some trouble to persuade her young readers that\\nthere might actually be a count charming out there for every shy\\nbella in the world. the perennially overcast weather of the pacific\\nnorthwest allows edward to attend school on most days, despite his\\nspecies\\' legendary photosensitivity, and he was raised, as it\\nhappens, in a family of \"good\" vampires, who thoughtfully eschew\\nthe consumption of human blood in favor of the nourishing (though\\nless tasty) vital fluids of animals. (they\\'re kind of the vampire\\nversion of vegans.) edward\\'s forbearance, however, is sorely tested\\nby the power of his feelings, and hardwicke said she believes that\\nthe ever-present possibility of bella\\'s death actually enhances the\\nstory\\'s romantic appeal. \"if \\'romeo and juliet\\' came out now it\\nwould be just as popular,\" she said. \"look at \\'titanic\\' a few\\nyears ago.\"\\n\\nshe\\'s on to something there: the extreme life-and-deathness of\\nthe adolescent notion of romance. but the vein that meyer\\'s story\\ntaps most obviously is simple, basic fear of sex. bella is,\\nrecognizably, every teenager who is terrified of going all the way,\\nand edward, less grounded in reality, is a fantasy incarnation of\\nthat scared girl\\'s ideal boyfriend, infinitely -- you might say\\neternally -- patient with her trepidation. (and have i mentioned\\nthat he\\'s extremely good-looking?)\\n\\n\"the truth,\" said the writer sarah langan, whose novel \"the\\nmissing\" won this year\\'s bram stoker award from the horror writers\\nassociation, \"is that sex can be terrifying at that age, even\\nwhen you\\'re in college.\" but langan, who considers \"twilight\"\\n\"more romance than horror,\" isn\\'t entirely persuaded by the\\nfear-of-sex model here.\\n\\n\"abstinence is a perfectly valid point of view,\" she said. \"\\n\\'twilight,\\' though, struck me as kind of a strange, wrong version\\nof what teenagers are like, especially edward, who doesn\\'t even\\nseem to want sex all that much. it made me long for judy blume.\"\\n\\nthe truly peculiar thing about \"twilight,\" of course, is that\\nthe figure presented here as a paragon of masculine self-control is\\nnot, in fact, human and drinks blood. over the years there have\\nbeen a fair number of youthful vampires in film and fiction, and\\nsome have even been portrayed as objects of desire. the title\\ncharacter of george a. romero\\'s \"martin\" (1977) probably wouldn\\'t\\nqualify as anybody\\'s romantic ideal. but the young lovers in\\nkathryn bigelow\\'s superb 1987 film, \"near dark,\" are tragically\\ncute, as are many of the teenage bloodsuckers in the lame \"lost\\nboys\" (1987), a long-unawaited sequel to which was released last\\nyear. there is a broodingly handsome vampire in the lurid new hbo\\nseries, \"true blood,\" too. \"vampirism is sexy,\" langan said\\nbluntly. \"it\\'s inherently arousing.\"\\n\\nbut until \"twilight,\" even vampires of the devastatingly,\\ninhumanly beautiful variety did manage, between tragic embraces, to\\nbe kind of scary. angel, the hunky, centuries-old love object of\\nbuffy the vampire slayer, would occasionally get a wrinkly,\\nfrom-hell look on his face, bare his fangs and give vent to the\\ndarker side of his nature. at those moments the viewer would fully\\nunderstand why he was a candidate for what buffy and her gang\\nreferred to as \"slayage.\" in \"twilight,\" slayage isn\\'t a\\npossibility: the only serious question for bella and her breathless\\nreaders is whether she\\'ll dare to do it with her bad-boy lover.\\n\\npsychologists call this approach/avoidance. and we all might as\\nwell figure out a way to approach this strange turn in pop culture,\\nbecause it looks as if there\\'s going to be no way to avoid it. the\\n20 minutes of \"twilight\" footage that the studio has made\\navailable indicate that the film will be, as hardwicke and\\nrosenberg promised, exceptionally faithful to its source material.\\n\\nthe leads, kristen stewart and robert pattinson, look right --\\nthere\\'s a touch of \"titanic\"-era leonardo dicaprio to pattinson --\\nand the mood is appropriately ominous. describing the shoot in\\nwashington, hardwicke said the weather was almost too apocalyptic\\nfor her taste. \"there was hail,\" she said, still shuddering\\nwith disbelief. \"i bought all this gore-tex, and nothing worked.\"\\n\\nthe whole thing has a slightly funky, no-big-deal air about it,\\nwhich is perhaps the result of the movie\\'s relatively modest budget\\n(less than $40 million) and the filmmakers\\' modest temperaments.\\nhardwicke is best known as the director of youthcentric indie films\\nlike \"thirteen\" (2003) and \"lords of dogtown\" (2005), while\\nrosenberg\\'s background is mostly in television, as a writer and\\nproducer of \"party of five\" and \"the o.c.\" (more recently, she\\nhas worked on the showtime series \"dexter,\" whose characters are\\ngrown-ups but which, she said, has something in common with\\n\"twilight\" nonetheless: it\\'s about a \"good\" serial killer with\\n\"internal demons he\\'s trying to control.\")\\n\\nthe movie also appears to capture the oddly timeless atmosphere\\nof the book, in which e-mail notes are sometimes sent but no text\\nmessages are, no video games are played, and no one seems to have\\nan ipod crammed with gangsta rap, emo or heavy metal. \"you try to\\nkeep current with teenagers\\' culture and idioms,\" rosenberg said,\\n\"but in \\'twilight\\' some of that feels incongruous. one of the\\nproducers actually said to me, \\'i\\'m uncomfortable when edward uses\\na cell phone.\\' \"\\n\\nwhat that means, maybe, is that the world of \"twilight\" is one\\nwhere incoming calls from the real world can rarely be heard with\\nany clarity in a fantasy universe of perpetual\\nneither-here-nor-thereness. sort of like adolescence itself, only\\ntouched up for maximum (devastating, inhuman) desirability. it\\'s a\\nplace on which the sun never has to set, where the bedtime story\\nnever has to end -- and that\\'s what its fans like best about it.\\n\\nnew laptops that boot up in 30 seconds? too slow for me. five\\nseconds? better, but what i want is a machine that\\'s ready in about\\na second, just like my smartphone.\\n\\ni\\'m fully aware that expressing any impatience with a computer\\'s\\nboot time invites derision. when the entire globe is engulfed in an\\neconomic crisis, measuring the seconds required to start different\\ncomputers may seem the most trivial of concerns.\\n\\nstill, i\\'m not alone. unhappiness with boot times, which\\ncommonly run 45 seconds to 60 seconds, is shared by many computer\\nusers, as reflected in much online discussion of the issue.\\n\\ni\\'ve come to believe that the unhappiness does not illustrate\\nimpatience. rather, it reflects an important shift in computing, as\\nwe increasingly rely on our laptops not as machines that we use for\\nlong stretches at a time, but as machines for using the internet,\\noften and briefly, and not much else. we don\\'t tolerate, and have\\nnever tolerated, long wait times that are disproportionate to the\\nactivity that follows them. if we need to spend only a few seconds\\nlooking up something on the web, it\\'s only natural that we want the\\npreparatory time to be as close to zero as possible. it\\'s not\\nimpatience, just proportionality.\\n\\nsmartphones provide access to e-mail and the web. and now a\\nfast-growing category of notebook computers, called netbooks, do\\nthe same, but with bigger displays and keyboards than the phones.\\nnetbooks are lightweight and inexpensive -- around $400 for many\\nmodels -- but to be truly useful, they need to be on and ready to go\\nimmediately, the way smartphones are.\\n\\nwe hear computer manufacturers promoting laptops that can boot\\nfaster than ever, but they prudently avoid direct comparisons with\\nsmartphones. the manufacturers have speeded up boot times by\\nequipping some windows machines with a separate subsystem that\\ncontains its own central processing unit. if you choose to use this\\nwhen you turn on the machine, windows is bypassed and a\\nmini-operating system is loaded instead, along with a limited set\\nof applications that include a web browser and a few other software\\nodds and ends.\\n\\nlimited functionality doesn\\'t bother me: a browser and e-mail\\nwill keep me happy. but these machines take too long to reach a\\nstate of usefulness. at present, the only way to bring a laptop to\\nlife quickly is to summon it not from a cold state, nor from deep\\nhibernation (suspend-to-disk), but from standby mode\\n(suspend-to-ram), in which the last session is stored in memory.\\nnetwork connections are lost, however, and holding the data in\\nmemory drains the battery.\\n\\none manufacturer whose ultralightweight netbooks have helped to\\ncreate the category is asus, based in taiwan. to achieve faster\\nboot times, asus equips its windows machines with express gate, a\\nsubsystem that it says can boot up in as few as eight seconds,\\ndepending on the speed of the processor and hard drive. the company\\nsent me a 6.2-pound g50v gaming machine for a test drive. i found\\nthat, in express gate mode, it took only eight seconds to boot up,\\nas promised, but this was only a preparatory step. in checking my\\ne-mail, 43 seconds elapsed before the browser loaded, my wi-fi\\nconnection was established and gmail opened.\\n\\na wholly different approach is taken by arjan van de ven and\\nauke kok, engineers at the intel open source technology center, who\\nset out to create versions of linux that boot up in only five\\nseconds, instead of the 45 normally required. they were also\\ndetermined to boot up with the main system, without relying on a\\nspecial subsystem like express gate. they succeeded, demonstrating\\ntheir feat at the linux plumbers conference in september with an\\nasus eee pc 901, equipped with a solid-state drive, which helps,\\nbut a slow atom cpu, which does not.\\n\\nvan de ven has since used the same techniques to reduce the boot\\ntime to only three seconds on laptops with the much faster core 2\\nduo cpus. the time needed to connect to the network and load a\\nbrowser, however, was not included.\\n\\nstill another approach, and to me the most intriguing, is being\\nreadied by dell for release by year-end. its latitude on feature\\nwill not try to claim the fastest boot time on the block: it will\\nstill take 40 seconds to 45 seconds to get its special non-windows\\nsubsystem up and running. but once it is on, it can stay on\\nindefinitely because it\\'s engineered with a low-voltage processor\\nto conserve battery power between charges. a dell spokesman said\\nthe laptops in the laboratory were getting \"almost four days\" of\\nuse on a single charge.\\n\\nhere\\'s what catches my interest: when you\\'re not using a\\nlatitude on laptop, its screen will go dark, but it\\'s not in\\nstandby mode -- it\\'s in a \"low-power state,\" as dell terms it.\\nthis permits it to keep network connections alive, including wi-fi\\nand 3g mobile broadband and even virtual private networks, while it\\ncontinuously loads e-mail in the background. with a touch, the\\nscreen lights up in 1 to 2 seconds, dell says, just as a smartphone\\ndoes.\\n\\nthat\\'s exactly what i\\'d like to have. in fact, that\\'s all i\\nwant: i don\\'t want to lug around the main system; i want just the\\nsubsystem that\\'s engineered for unbroken internet connections and\\nfrequent, brief looks. dell, however, is not offering this as an\\ninexpensive netbook. latitude on will be packaged as one feature on\\na fully loaded notebook marketed to corporate executives; dell has\\nnot announced pricing but currently those models begin at $1,999.\\n\\nmore bad news: its intended customers, corporate it departments,\\nhave directed dell to require a password from a user every time the\\nmachine returns to full power.\\n\\nno, thanks. i will wait, then, for the next generation of\\ninstant-on machines, maintaining internet connections even when the\\nscreen is darkened, serving uncomplainingly for days on a single\\ncharge and priced inexpensively -- and with passwords made optional.\\n\\nif that takes a while, fine. i\\'m patient.\\n\\nmy twin brother, eli, is jealous of sea horses. they are the\\nonly animal species in which the male gives birth to the offspring.\\nmale sea horses have brood pouches where the female deposits her\\neggs. the eggs then hatch in the father\\'s pouch, where the young\\ncontinue to live until they are expelled into the ocean after\\nstrenuous labor that can last several days.\\n\\neli is a transgender man, and lived the first 20 years of our\\nlives as my fraternal twin sister. i have plenty of memories of my\\ntwin as a little girl, as emma, not eli. more often, though, my\\nmemories adjust to represent eli as i know him now, as my brother.\\n\\nwhen we were 5, living in a small apartment in portland, ore.,\\nmy mother made our favorite breakfast of buckwheat pancakes on\\nweekends, shaping the batter into k\\'s and e\\'s, for kate and emma.\\none morning as my mother assembled the ingredients, emma,\\npretending she was a chicken, took two eggs from the counter and\\nplaced them next to each other on the carpet. i remember it was a\\npair of eggs, because even at our young age we knew what it meant\\nto be twins, and whenever we played house, babies came in twos.\\n\\nemma jammed her thumbs under her armpits and pumped her arms in\\nexcited flutters before crouching gently above the eggs, as if to\\nincubate them. then it was over. the mother hen accidentally sat on\\nher eggs.\\n\\nemma stood up, crying, as egg whites ran down the backs of her\\nlegs. as a 5-year-old girl, she couldn\\'t have known how her\\nrelationship with eggs would again be tinged with tragedy when she\\nwas an adult.\\n\\na few years later we were living in an apartment complex with a\\nswimming pool, and that summer we lived in our swimsuits, which\\nwere practically worn translucent by september. each evening we\\nwould compare our tan lines and soothe our wind-chapped cheeks.\\n\\nsometimes we had the pool to ourselves. other times visiting\\ngrandchildren or older boys from another building would show up,\\ntowels in hand, interrupting our games with their unpredictable and\\nexplosive splashing.\\n\\n\"god,\" my usually patient twin fumed when a hulk of a boy\\njumped into our floating contest. \"i hate boys.\" she paused to\\nshake water out of her ear. \"you know what they are?\"\\n\\n\"what?\"\\n\\n\"baked beans in human skin,\" she said, her cheeks bright.\\n\\ni glanced at the boys, then back at her, laughing and feeling\\nthe solidarity of sisters, which, looking back, strikes me as\\ndelightfully ironic. did an envy of boys already lurk in emma\\'s\\nsubconscious? was her mind already puzzling over bodies and skin,\\nheart and soul, how it all fits together, and what happens when it\\ndoesn\\'t?\\n\\nemma and i started menstruating three days apart. she bled\\nfirst, which made her seem old and wise when i followed close on\\nher heels, both of us fumbling with pads and aspirin and new\\nknowledge.\\n\\ngrowing up a twin, i thought everything that happened to my\\ncounterpart would happen to me. but our shared experience diverged\\nat age 20, when emma realized, after several years of grappling\\nwith gender, that she wasn\\'t meant to be female. he was male, and\\nhe chose eli as his new name. soon hormone replacement therapy\\nwould begin to change eli\\'s female body to match his male sense of\\nself.\\n\\neven as this process raised new questions for our family, the\\nmore clearly eli articulated his identity, the closer i felt to\\nhim. our mother\\'s support was more tempered by concern about the\\ninevitable struggles to come: how would eli be viewed in society?\\nhow would he raise a family?\\n\\neli\\'s gender transition has occurred in many stages. and while\\nsome aspects of his metamorphosis (the deepening voice, the chest\\nsurgery) are permanent, other changes, like eli\\'s new musculature\\nand the redistribution of body fat away from his hips, would\\nreverse if he were to stop hormone therapy.\\n\\nbut when it comes to the effects of testosterone on the female\\nreproductive system, the impact is profound. and while the\\npermanence of the damage is not entirely known, reproductive\\noptions for transgender men become more limited the longer they\\ntake testosterone.\\n\\nsome transgender men have hysterectomies early in their\\ntransitions, eliminating all reminders of their female reproductive\\ncapacity. others either don\\'t think such surgery is necessary or\\ndefer in the hope that they might someday be able to bear children\\nthemselves.\\n\\neli has confided in me his reservations about sacrificing this\\nelement of female experience. he now faces tough choices about how\\nto reconcile the reality of his physical transition with his desire\\nto have biological children.\\n\\nresearchers continue to explore reproductive technologies, yet\\neven with possible breakthroughs on the horizon, my brother\\'s\\nchance of successfully bearing his own child depends on society\\'s\\nwillingness to embrace a new understanding of pregnancy as an\\nexperience no longer reserved only for women -- an understanding, in\\nfact, that not all people with a uterus are women.\\n\\nsometimes the realization that eli might not be able to bear\\nchildren of his own suffocates me, and i ache for simplicity and\\nanswers. we talk often about his worries, and they have become my\\nown, as with everything we share.\\n\\nshould he stop taking the testosterone now so that maybe in five\\nyears he can try to become pregnant? should he suspend the hormone\\ntherapy and try to use his eggs to freeze embryos for later, or\\nkeep taking the hormones and have a hysterectomy to eliminate any\\nchance that he might get ovarian cancer? should he pursue other\\navenues of parenthood, like adoption?\\n\\nwhat 23-year-old should have to face such choices? eli is full\\nof life, yet soon to be rendered infertile by the very treatment\\nthat has made possible his visions of himself as father. and so we\\nwait for the day when science might make a sea horse of him.\\n\\na year into eli\\'s transition, roughly two and a half years ago,\\ni sat in my college\\'s health services complex awaiting results of\\nmy own pregnancy test. my very regular cycle was late, and i\\nberated myself for the false sense of security that three years on\\nthe pill had given me. ten minutes later, when the result was\\nnegative and the nurse told me to check back in a week if my period\\ndidn\\'t come, i still couldn\\'t let out my breath. i sat there\\ncursing my fertility, its inconveniences and threats.\\n\\nat the same time, my twin sat in the waiting room of the\\ncallen-lorde community health center in manhattan, facing the\\ndecision of whether to ask for his weekly hormone shot in the thigh\\nor the backside, depending on where he thought the concentrated\\ntestosterone would cause the least muscle cramping the next day.\\n(it would be another year of such appointments before he would be\\napproved to inject himself.)\\n\\neli told me he enjoyed watching the oily liquid be drawn up into\\nthe syringe and then deposited into his muscle. in the months to\\ncome he would continue to worry about his fertility, mourn its\\nfleeting existence, wish he did not have to give it up. we were\\nboth in awe of the power of hormone therapy to vanquish his\\nmenstrual cycle, but we were learning a lesson in sacrifice.\\n\\na year after my pregnancy scare i found myself staring at an\\nadvertisement in a public bathroom for a local fertility clinic\\nappealing for \"exceptional egg donors.\" i tensed with the\\nrecognition of a truth i had known (if never spoken) since the day\\neli called to announce his transition: if he ever needs eggs that\\nhave a genetic link to his own, i will give him mine.\\n\\nthey could be implanted in a female partner or surrogate, or, in\\nthe event we do one day become like sea horses, in him. there\\'s\\nsomething reassuring in the possibility, however remote.\\n\\nin our attempts to understand disruptions of self and\\nrelationships, we often look to the natural world to tell us\\nstories of ourselves. we hope the animal kingdom will naturalize\\nbehavior that falls outside of the human binary. we exclaim over\\ngay penguins in the central park zoo. we note patterns of grieving\\nin animals from geese to elephants to help locate our own mourning\\nin a larger continuum of emotional response. we point to\\npromiscuous chimpanzees, monogamous swans and polygamous walruses\\nto illuminate the dueling joys and heartbreaks of human mating\\nbehavior.\\n\\nas the complexities of my brother\\'s transition threaten his\\nnewfound tranquillity, my whole family has turned to the sea horse\\nto give us perspective. it\\'s easier for me to think about the\\nunimaginably tough choices my brother has had to make if i can\\ncrack jokes with him about pregnant sea horse fathers bucking the\\ngender binary from the depths of the ocean.\\n\\nmy mother? she has started compulsively bidding on sea horse\\nparaphernalia on ebay. with a potential grandmother\\'s curiosity,\\nshe daydreams about eli\\'s children (perhaps he could have twins,\\nand surely they would be voracious readers, too) but approaches the\\nsituation with a mother\\'s patience.\\n\\nlast christmas she bought eli a glass bowl with delicately\\netched sea horses around its rim. the bowl now sits on a table in\\neli\\'s room, holding his syringes and bottle of testosterone.\\ninspired, eli and i went a step further on our birthday by getting\\nmatching shoulder tattoos of two entwined sea horses.\\n\\nfor just over two years, eli\\'s body has carried the testosterone\\nthat is responsible for the biggest -- he sometimes says only --\\nsacrifice of his transition: the loss of his fertility. while we no\\nlonger call ourselves sisters, our identity as twins is unchanged,\\nand we remain deeply connected: by friendship, by ink and by our\\nshared conviction that, like the male sea horse, eli will be an\\nexcellent father.\\n\\nafter president mccain or president obama takes the oath of\\noffice in january, he may have a shiny new black limousine to go\\nalong with his not-so-new white house. general motors is believed\\nto be putting the final touches on a new first car.\\n\\nan analysis of unauthorized photographs taken while the car was\\nbeing tested last summer on public roads suggests that the\\npresidential ride will be a truck-based cadillac. it will\\npresumably replace the cadillac that president bush has used since\\n2005.\\n\\nthis new car will be a caddy like no other. the photos by chris\\ndoane, a spy photographer who hunts big automotive game -- future\\nmodels that haven\\'t been publicly revealed -- for magazines and web\\nsites, provide clues about how specialized presidential\\ntransportation has become since the first white house fleet was\\nordered for william howard taft in 1909. president taft rode in a\\nstock white steam car or a conventional pierce-arrow, but the next\\npresident will travel in a fortress-like vehicle that was mostly\\nbuilt from scratch.\\n\\nthe photographer noted that the limousine was being tested,\\npossibly for comparison purposes, with a pair of gmc topkick\\nmedium-duty trucks. the limousine seemed to be riding on the same\\n19.5-inch goodyear regional rhs tires as the trucks, indicating\\nthat it is far heavier than a civilian cadillac -- even the longest\\nstretch limousines built with the gm division\\'s heavy-duty\\ncoachbuilder package. indeed, it is believed that the limo is based\\non gm\\'s 2500 line of trucks, which includes an extra-heavy-duty\\nversion of the suburban.\\n\\nalthough the raised roof and wide windshield pillars are\\ninherited from the ultra-armored limousines that entered\\npresidential service in 2001, only educated guesses can be made\\nabout the technical details. because neither the secret service nor\\ngeneral motors will discuss the car, or even confirm that a new one\\nhas been under development, it is impossible to provide basic\\nspecifications or dimensions. calls to cadillac\\'s media relations\\ndepartment were not returned, and the secret service declined to\\ncomment.\\n\\nso people who are curious about such things look for clues and\\nmake deductions. i have spent almost 30 years paying close\\nattention to presidential vehicles as part of my interest in what\\nare called professional cars, which also include hearses and\\nambulances. (i am the author of \"professional cars: ambulances,\\nhearses and flower cars,\" krause publications, 2004.)\\n\\nother sources i have consulted on cars used by past presidents\\ninclude \"presidential cars and transportation\" by william d.\\nsiuru jr. and andrea stewart (krause publications, 1995) and\\n\"presidents on wheels\" by herbert ridgeway collins (bonanza\\nbooks, 1971). but my interest has me looking for clues wherever i\\ncan find them.\\n\\nfor example, television clips showing george w. bush entering\\nand exiting the rear doors of his limos indicate that the windows\\nare at least 5 inches thick, nearly twice the depth of what was\\nused on presidential limousines in the 1980s and \\'90s.\\n\\nwhile i do not know what type of weapons such thick windows are\\ndesigned to guard against, a half-inch of transparent armor is\\nenough to stop a .44 magnum round at point-blank range; at a\\nthickness of 1.25 inches to 1.5 inches, the same material can\\nwithstand higher-velocity bullets fired from military assault\\nrifles.\\n\\nwere an attack to occur, the ballistic forces of bullets fired\\ninto the windows would be absorbed within a succession of glass and\\nplastic layers, after which a flexible inner coating known as an\\nantispall shield would keep glass from entering the passenger\\ncompartment.\\n\\nthough the materials protecting the car\\'s body are also\\nclassified, they are probably intended to break up incoming\\nprojectiles with a hard substance before their energy is dissipated\\nby a soft substance. material traditionally used for this purpose\\nincludes dual-hardness steel, aluminum, titanium and ceramics.\\n\\nlarge steel overlaps are also typically added to the body\\nopenings of armored autos to deter attackers who might try shooting\\nthrough the door gaps.\\n\\ndenied the convertible tops and sunroofs that were once found on\\npresidents\\' cars, and seated behind glass that is half as\\ntransparent and several times as sound-absorbent as that of a\\nstandard car, the president has limited interaction with the public\\nwhile inside his limo. but he can make his presence known by\\nturning on fluorescent interior lighting that makes him visible to\\nbystanders, or by using the built-in public address system.\\n\\naircraft tie-downs welded to the chassis allow the limousine to\\nbe transported aboard a military cargo jet, which also often\\ncarries the secret service\\'s suburban escort vehicles and at least\\none limo used as a backup or decoy.\\n\\non television footage of a trip to pakistan in march 2000, it\\nappeared as though president bill clinton\\'s motorcade used five\\ndecoy cars.\\n\\nthus, it is likely that gm is building not just one new\\npresidential limousine, but perhaps two or three that can be used\\nas backups or decoys. there will be no way of knowing until the\\ncars are seen together.\\n\\npresidential limos would have great appeal to collectors. but\\nthe secret service has shown no enthusiasm for letting recent white\\nhouse cars fall into private hands. when the cars are retired, they\\noften disappear, to be destroyed or used in secret service\\ntraining.\\n\\nthe department of state also uses specialized vehicles, and the\\nagency\\'s disposal methods have been detailed in a document entitled\\n\"bureau of diplomatic security\\'s february 2004 armored vehicle\\nprogram.\" methods include burial at sea, explosive demolition,\\nburning, crushing or burial on land controlled by the federal\\ngovernment.\\n\\nin the same spirit, the clinton presidential library in little\\nrock, ark., was not given the keys to the 42nd president\\'s 1993\\ncadillac fleetwood, which is displayed there.\\n\\n\"we can dust the outside of the car, but if we needed to get\\ninside it, we would have to contact the regional secret service\\noffice,\" christine mouw, the library curator, said in an\\ninterview. \"we\\'ve had requests from people to exhibit it with the\\ndoors open, but we\\'re told we can\\'t do it for security reasons,\\nwhich is logical.\"\\n\\nforty years ago, a panel of auto journalists picked the nsu ro80\\nas european car of the year. now mostly forgotten, the ro80 was a\\ngerman sedan with an aerodynamic shape that presaged the audi 5000\\nand ford taurus of the 1980s. as important as its trend-setting\\nstyling, though, the ro80 featured the first wankel engine in a\\nmass-produced car.\\n\\npotential game-changers in the auto industry have often ended up\\nas blind alleys. dinosaurs at least have birds as their living\\nlegacy, but innovative cars like the tucker, corvair and citroen ds\\ncan be found only in the automotive fossil record. carmakers have\\nlearned that it doesn\\'t always pay to innovate.\\n\\nbut for a brief time in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it\\nlooked as if real innovation was taking hold in the form of a new\\npowerplant that was lighter, smoother, simpler than a reciprocating\\npiston engine and also capable of producing more power for its\\nsize. companies from american motors to mercedes-benz rushed to\\nlicense wankel engine technology.\\n\\nfelix wankel, an engineer at nsu, had been experimenting since\\n1954 with a simpler internal-combustion engine. his elegant design\\nconsisted of a rounded triangular \"rotor\" that spun in an oval\\ncombustion chamber. as the rotor moved in its eccentric orbit\\naround a central shaft, the area of the three combustion chambers\\n(one for each side of the triangle) contracted, creating\\ncompression and thus power.\\n\\nbut an obstacle to engine longevity emerged: it was hard to get\\na good seal on the combustion chambers where the rotor tips, or\\napexes, met the inside of the chamber.\\n\\nbefore the ro80, there had been attempts at wankel-powered cars\\n-- nsu\\'s own wankel spider and the mazda cosmo sports cars -- but the\\nro80 was the revolutionary engine\\'s first shot at the big time. if\\nthings had gone as planned, bmw wouldn\\'t be the only prestigious\\nthree-letter brand of german cars today.\\n\\ninitial orders for the 1968 nsu ro80 were brisk. soon, however,\\nnsu was dealing in damage control.\\n\\nin late 1968, the german magazine auto motor und sport reported\\nthat half of the 191 ro80 owners it had surveyed said that engines\\nhad been replaced under warranty. in neglecting to test the cars in\\nreal-world stop-and-start driving conditions, nsu snatched defeat\\nfrom the jaws of victory.\\n\\nthe culprit turned out to be bad bearings and ineffective rotor\\ntip seals; the warranty claims that resulted nearly drove the\\ncompany to bankruptcy. nsu eventually merged with volkswagen.\\n\\nhowever, in a protracted deal involving a cast of many --\\nincluding felix wankel and, oddly, a group of israeli bankers --\\nseveral former nsu shareholders retained control of licensing\\nrights to the engine. still, it fell to the japanese to perfect the\\npower plant.\\n\\ntoyo kogyo, the parent company of mazda, was one of about 18 nsu\\nwankel licensees. in the late 1960s, mazda decided that its future\\nlay in differentiating itself from toyota and nissan. it cast its\\nlot with the wankel, which the company called the rotary engine.\\nthe first rotary-powered mazda to make an impact in the united\\nstates was the rx-2, introduced in 1970.\\n\\nthe rx-2 was a small coupe roughly the size of a toyota corolla,\\nbut with the pep of a small v-8. enthusiasts gushed over the smooth\\nand ample power.\\n\\nc.j. batten was the first design engineer that ford hired for\\nits wankel development program in 1971. in a recent interview,\\nbatten said that ford began looking at the wankel because its\\narchrival, general motors, \"had one that was nearly\\nproduction-ready\" for its chevrolet monza coupe.\\n\\nin an interview, batten recalled evaluating a mazda and being\\nimpressed. \"the rx-2 with a little over 100 horsepower would run\\nlike a 200-horsepower mustang,\" he said. batten reckons that the\\nadvantages in packaging and smoothness weren\\'t enough to overcome\\nthe reciprocating engine\\'s advantage of incumbency.\\n\\ngm\\'s president, ed cole, was a proponent of the wankel. in the\\nearly 1970s, gm showed several wankel-powered midengine corvette\\ndesign studies that would have been world-class sports cars. car\\nmagazines said the sleek mid-engine \\'vette was a sure bet for\\nproduction. cole also planned to use the wankel in mainstream cars.\\n\\nbatten recalls that as wishful thinking. he said the accountants\\nwho held the purse strings pointed out that chevrolet could already\\nsell every corvette it could build. why was a more advanced, more\\nexpensive car needed? the logic was hard to dispute, and the\\ncorvette would soldier on until 1984 with its 1963-vintage\\nplatform.\\n\\nnot much later, cole retired and the arab oil embargo\\nunderscored how thirsty the early wankels were. gm\\'s wankel program\\ncame to a sudden halt. ford ended its development program.\\n\\nthe cancellation of gm\\'s wankel even had a ripple affect on\\namerican motors, which had engineered its futuristic, glassy pacer\\nto take a gm-built wankel. instead, amc had to make do with a heavy\\ncast-iron 6-cylinder.\\n\\nthe only automaker other than nsu and mazda to market a\\nwankel-powered production car was citroen, a company that\\ncelebrated eccentricity. but mercedes-benz expressed an interest,\\nteasing enthusiasts in 1970 with the brilliant c111-ii research car\\nthat had gullwing doors and a 370-horsepower four-rotor wankel that\\ncould reach 180 miles an hour.\\n\\nthe 1974 arab oil embargo hit mazda hard. its small rx-2 could\\nbarely manage 15 miles a gallon, about half as much as the\\ncomparably sized corolla. the rx-3, a larger successor, added a\\nwagon body style. but that car was bigger and heavier and had even\\nworse mileage.\\n\\nmazdas piled up at dealers and at the ports, so the company\\nhedged its bets with piston-engine cars while it improved the\\nrotary\\'s cleanliness and efficiency. in 1978, it introduced the car\\nthat made the best use to date of the rotary\\'s distinctive\\nqualities. the 1979 rx-7 was a milestone; at a time when sports\\ncars were growing flabby, the rx-7 was light, nimble and basic with\\nan engine so rev-happy that a buzzer had to be installed to let the\\ndriver know when the engine speed had reached the danger zone.\\n\\nmazda\\'s new strategy was to reserve the rotary for its specialty\\ncars, while using piston engines in the rest of its line. mazda\\'s\\nrotary design reached its pinnacle with the renesis engine\\nintroduced in the 2003 rx-8, the most powerful, efficient and\\ncleanest naturally aspirated wankel yet. and because it is also\\nwell-suited to run on hydrogen, it may have a future beyond the odd\\nfour-door coupe that it currently lives in.\\n\\nearly wankel cars seldom appear for sale in the united states.\\nthe ro80 is somewhat popular as a collectible in britain, though\\nmany have been refitted with more reliable mazda engines. prices\\nrun around $15,000. a wankel spider recently sold on ebay for\\n$17,000.\\n\\nfirst-year mazda rx-7s are bargains at $4,000 to $6,000. the\\n1967 mazda cosmo is the most collectible early wankel car. in 2007,\\na seller at an auction in australia turned down an $83,000 bid.\\n\\nchallenging the crowd in whispers, not shouts (economic view) robert j. shiller is professor of economics and finance at yale and co-founder and chief economist of macromarkets llc.      alan greenspan, the former federal reserve chairman,\\nacknowledged in a congressional hearing last month that he had made\\nan \"error\" in assuming that the markets would properly regulate\\nthemselves, and added that he had no idea a financial disaster was\\nin the making. what\\'s more, he said the fed\\'s own computer models\\nand economic experts simply \"did not forecast\" the current\\nfinancial crisis.\\n\\ngreenspan\\'s comments may have left the impression that no one in\\nthe world could have predicted the crisis. yet it is clear that\\nwell before home prices started falling in 2006, lots of people\\nwere worried about the housing boom and its potential for creating\\neconomic disaster. it\\'s just that the fed did not take them very\\nseriously.\\n\\nfor example, i clearly remember a taxi driver in miami\\nexplaining to me years ago that the housing bubble there was\\ngetting crazy. with all the construction under way, which he\\npointed out as we drove along, he said that there would surely be a\\nglut in the market and, eventually, a disaster.\\n\\nbut why weren\\'t the experts at the fed saying such things? and\\nwhy didn\\'t a consensus of economists at universities and other\\ninstitutions warn that a crisis was on the way?\\n\\nthe field of social psychology provides a possible answer. in\\nhis classic 1972 book, \"groupthink,\" irving l. janis, the yale\\npsychologist, explained how panels of experts could make colossal\\nmistakes. people on these panels, he said, are forever worrying\\nabout their personal relevance and effectiveness, and feel that if\\nthey deviate too far from the consensus, they will not be given a\\nserious role. they self-censor personal doubts about the emerging\\ngroup consensus if they cannot express these doubts in a formal way\\nthat conforms with apparent assumptions held by the group.\\n\\nmembers of the fed staff were issuing some warnings. but\\ngreenspan was right: the warnings were not predictions. they tended\\nto be technical in nature, did not offer a scenario of crashing\\nhome prices and economic confidence, and tended to come late in the\\nhousing boom.\\n\\na search of the federal reserve board\\'s working paper series\\nreveals a few papers that touch on the bubble. for example, a 2004\\npaper by joshua gallin, a fed economist, concluded: \"indeed, one\\nmight be tempted to cite the currently low level of the rent-price\\nratio as a sign that we are in a house-price \\'bubble.\"\\' but the\\npaper did not endorse this view, saying that \"several important\\ncaveats argue against such a strong conclusion and in favor of\\nfurther research.\"\\n\\none of greenspan\\'s fellow board members, edward m. gramlich,\\nurgently warned about the inadequate regulation of subprime\\nmortgages. but judging at least from his 2007 book, \"subprime\\nmortgages,\" he did not warn about a housing bubble, let alone that\\nits bursting would have any systemic consequences.\\n\\nfrom my own experience on expert panels, i know firsthand the\\npressures that people -- might i say mavericks? -- may feel when\\nquestioning the group consensus.\\n\\ni was connected with the federal reserve system as a member the\\neconomic advisory panel of the federal reserve bank of new york\\nfrom 1990 until 2004, when the new york bank\\'s new president,\\ntimothy f. geithner, arrived. that panel advises the president of\\nthe new york bank, who, in turn, is vice chairman of the federal\\nopen market committee, which sets interest rates. in my position on\\nthe panel, i felt the need to use restraint. while i warned about\\nthe bubbles i believed were developing in the stock and housing\\nmarkets, i did so very gently, and felt vulnerable expressing such\\nquirky views. deviating too far from consensus leaves one feeling\\npotentially ostracized from the group, with the risk that one may\\nbe terminated.\\n\\nreading some of geithner\\'s speeches from around that time shows\\nthat he was concerned about systemic risks but concluded that the\\nfinancial system was getting \"stronger\" and more \"resilient.\"\\nhe was worried about the unsustainability of a low savings rate,\\ngovernment deficit and current account deficit, none of which\\ncaused our current crisis.\\n\\nin 2005, in the second edition of my book \"irrational\\nexuberance,\" i stated clearly that a catastrophic collapse of the\\nhousing and stock markets could be on its way. i wrote that\\n\"significant further rises in these markets could lead,\\neventually, to even more significant declines,\" and that this\\nmight \"result in a substantial increase in the rate of personal\\nbankruptcies, which could lead to a secondary string of\\nbankruptcies of financial institutions as well,\" and said that\\nthis could result in \"another, possibly worldwide, recession.\"\\n\\ni distinctly remember that, while writing this, i feared\\ncriticism for gratuitous alarmism. and indeed, such criticism came.\\n\\ni gave talks in 2005 at both the office of the comptroller of\\nthe currency and at the federal deposit insurance corp., in which i\\nargued that we were in the middle of a dangerous housing bubble. i\\nurged these mortgage regulators to impose suitability requirements\\non mortgage lenders, to assure that the loans were appropriate for\\nthe people taking them.\\n\\nthe reaction to this suggestion was roughly this: yes, some\\nstaff members had expressed such concerns, and yes, officials knew\\nabout the possibility that there was a bubble, but they weren\\'t\\ntaking any of us seriously.\\n\\ni based my predictions largely on the recently developed field\\nof behavioral economics, which posits that psychology matters for\\neconomic events. behavioral economists are still regarded as a\\nfringe group by many mainstream economists. support from fellow\\nbehavioral economists was important in my daring to talk about\\nspeculative bubbles.\\n\\nspeculative bubbles are caused by contagious excitement about\\ninvestment prospects. i find that in casual conversation, many of\\nmy mainstream economist friends tell me that they are aware of such\\nexcitement, too. but very few will talk about it professionally.\\n\\nwhy do professional economists always seem to find that concerns\\nwith bubbles are overblown or unsubstantiated? i have wondered\\nabout this for years, and still do not quite have an answer. it\\nmust have something to do with the tool kit given to economists (as\\nopposed to psychologists) and perhaps even with the self-selection\\nof those attracted to the technical, mathematical field of\\neconomics. economists aren\\'t generally trained in psychology, and\\nso want to divert the subject of discussion to things they\\nunderstand well. they pride themselves on being rational. the\\nnotion that people are making huge errors in judgment is not\\nappealing.\\n\\nin addition, it seems that concerns about professional stature\\nmay blind us to the possibility that we are witnessing a market\\nbubble. we all want to associate ourselves with dignified people\\nand dignified ideas. speculative bubbles, and those who study them,\\nhave been deemed undignified.\\n\\nin short, janis\\' insights seem right on the mark. people compete\\nfor stature, and the ideas often just tag along. presidential\\ncampaigns are no different. candidates cannot try interesting and\\ncontroversial new ideas during a campaign whose main purpose is to\\nestablish that the candidate has the stature to be president.\\nunless greenspan was exceptionally insightful about social\\npsychology, he may not have perceived that experts around him could\\nhave been subject to the same traps.\\n\\nthose who are hoping to earn extra money for the holidays this\\nyear may find the seasonal market anything but generous, as jobs\\nare likely to be scarce and competition intense.\\n\\nbecause consumers are weighed down with economic worries,\\nretailers face \"incredible challenges heading into the fourth\\nquarter,\" rosalind wells, chief economist for the national retail\\nfederation, said in a statement last month.\\n\\nto meet those challenges, they may have to trim both inventory\\nlevels and labor costs -- and recent surveys about seasonal hiring\\nbear this out.\\n\\njonas prising, president of the north american division of the\\nstaffing firm manpower, said the company\\'s quarterly employment\\noutlook survey showed the hiring market for the wholesale-retail\\nsector to be the weakest in 17 years.\\n\\nat a time when retailers should be gearing up for the holiday\\nseason, many are taking a wait-and-see approach. \"there is a lot\\nof talent out there looking for work, so the actual decision for\\nbusinesses to ramp up a work force can be made later in the\\nseason,\" he said. \"even in dining, hotels and call centers, they\\ncan wait a little later.\"\\n\\nfew companies will acknowledge publicly that they are scaling\\nback holiday hiring, because it implies slowing sales, said shawn\\nboyer, chief executive of snagajob.com, a job board for hourly\\npositions. but according to surveys done by the company, managers\\nin general are planning to hire fewer workers this year, he said.\\n\\npart of the reason is that existing staff members are agreeing\\nto take on additional hours. \"more people are interested in doing\\novertime this year, so businesses are waiting later in the season\\nto hire,\" boyer said.\\n\\nfor some businesses, the credit crisis has compounded the\\nproblem of declining consumer spending because credit lines they\\noften use to stock stores and finance seasonal hiring are not\\navailable.\\n\\neven businesses holding their own during this downturn are being\\ncautious. john thrailkill, vice president of stores at the\\ncontainer store, said locations in manhattan; white plains, n.y.;\\nand paramus, n.j., were hiring roughly the same number of workers\\nas last year, partly because people who live in smaller spaces need\\nmore storage capacity. but stores in other parts of the country\\nwith slower sales are likely to cut back their hiring, he said.\\n\\n\"scheduling has become more important now, too,\" he said. \"we\\nare really digging into every hour at every store to make sure that\\nif we only need 12 people on the floor during a particular hour, we\\ndon\\'t have 13.\"\\n\\nemmanuel tam, who lives in new york\\'s harlem neighborhood and\\nwas laid off this summer from his job as a media literacy\\ninstructor in the bronx, says that there is simply too much\\ncompetition. although he has been searching for a full-time job\\nsince july, he is now also applying for temporary holiday work.\\n\"i\\'m going everywhere,\" he said. \"i\\'ve tried retail stores, temp\\nagencies, snagajob. i go out every day and put in applications.\"\\n\\nalthough tam expected a competitive landscape for full-time\\nwork, he was surprised at the number of applicants for holiday\\njobs. \"a year ago i wouldn\\'t have thought i would have trouble\\ngetting one of those positions,\" he said. \"but now i will take\\nwhatever comes along. i have no choice.\"\\n\\nretailers often hire from the same pool of workers they used in\\nprevious holiday seasons, but new job seekers can increase their\\nchances by highlighting on their applications any special skills\\nthey have -- speaking more than one language, for example, or\\nexperience in customer service, said rosaleena marcellus, vice\\npresident of client services and head of the retail practice at\\nglobal lead, a management consulting firm based in cincinnati.\\n\\napplicants may also need to be more flexible about scheduling\\nthan they were in previous years. \"you need to have a wide\\navailability that is easy to describe, such as \\'every afternoon\\nafter 5 p.m. and any time on the weekend,\"\\' said dan russell, a\\nvice president for the human resources firm aon consulting in\\nchicago who works with retailers on work-force selection. \"you\\ndon\\'t want to go in with a really complex schedule, because a\\nhiring manager doesn\\'t have the time to deal with that.\"\\n\\nsnagajob encourages job seekers to spread their bets by applying\\nfor jobs in a variety of environments and industries -- like low-\\nand high-end retailing, hotels and restaurants, and airlines.\\n\"it\\'s a numbers game,\" boyer said.\\n\\nit\\'s not all doom and gloom, either. discount retailers like\\nwal-mart and target are likely to be hiring more seasonal workers\\nthan higher-end department stores, marcellus said. \"people who\\nnormally go to middle-scale stores are going to shop at discounters\\nthis year,\" she said.\\n\\nanother bright spot is online shopping. this season, it is\\nexpected to increase by 12 percent, according to a report released\\nin october by forrester, the technology research firm.\\n\\nsucharita mulpuru, an analyst at forrester covering online\\nretailing, said: \"this is one sector in retail that should be\\nlooking for more people.\" that means fulfillment centers and call\\ncenters will be looking for workers.\\n\\ndialamerica, a teleservices company in mahwah, n.j., expects its\\nbusiness to expand about 20 percent this quarter. the company\\'s\\nclients are in a variety of industries, but about 20 percent are\\nretailers using customer service agents for online and catalog\\nsales.\\n\\n\"we are definitely hiring,\" said mary conway, the company\\'s\\nchief marketing officer. job seekers with listening skills, the\\nability to think on their feet and respond appropriately stand a\\ngood chance of finding work at a teleservices company, conway said.\\n\\n\"i get the sense our clients are going to raise the numbers of\\nagents they need for the holidays,\" she said, \"because they are\\nrelying heavily on this to be a successful channel for them.\\n\\n\"quite frankly,\" she added, \"we\\'re nervous we won\\'t have\\nenough capacity.\"\\n\\nthis tuesday night, as history of one sort or another is being\\nmade, where will you be watching election returns?\\n\\nif you happen to be in alaska, know that the doors of the\\nwasilla multi-use sports complex will be flung open at 3 p.m. for\\nfood, beer, wine and -- in between updates on giant televisions --\\ndancing to a new local rock band, sarah and the pit bulls. although\\nthis civic festival is ostensibly nonpartisan, it is billed on the\\nweb as a \"victory celebration.\"\\n\\nat the same hour in washington -- 7 p.m., east coast time -- the\\ndoors to the new bethel baptist church will be flung open for what\\nthe rev. walter e. fauntroy, a former aide to the rev. dr. martin\\nluther king jr., calls a \"watch-night service,\" also replete with\\nfood and televisions (but minus the alcohol).\\n\\n\"i am cautiously optimistic that before the night is out,\"\\nsaid fauntroy, the church\\'s pastor, \"i will experience what i do\\nat weddings: someone singing, \\'this is the moment.\"\\'\\n\\non the evening of nov. 4, true believers from each party will\\ngather at churches, meetings halls, block parties, bars and parks\\nbetween wasilla and washington, anticipating a communal exaltation\\nof historic dimension.\\n\\nbut for millions of others, it will be a night infused with\\nbody-quaking fear on a seismic scale, about the economy,\\nemployment, war. conversations last week with quotidian voters -- as\\nwell as not-so-quotidian ones -- suggest that many people may want\\nto gather less for a party than for a huddle, a support group.\\nrepublicans are hedging their bets. democrats say they are wary,\\nskeptical, superstitious even. judging by them, and not the polls\\nthat favor sen. barack obama, if there\\'s a donkey braying in the\\nland, that would be eeyore.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know anyone who is planning to whoop it up,\" said\\ndiane asadorian masters, an obama supporter from west lafayette,\\nind.\\n\\nkyle t. smoke, chairman of the college republicans at the\\nuniversity of texas at dallas, said that his group would not attend\\nthe student government\\'s bipartisan party. instead, members will\\nwatch with the grown-ups at the dallas county republican party\\'s\\ngathering. \"tensions are high,\" he said. \"we think it\\'s in the\\nbest interest to be with our own people so we can either celebrate\\nor sulk together.\"\\n\\nayelet waldman, a novelist from berkeley, calif., who campaigned\\nhard for obama, will fly to chicago on tuesday to work the phones,\\nknocking wood and spitting over her shoulder as she does so. \"i\\ncannot take comfort in the polls,\" said waldman, who, with her\\nhusband and four children, planned to gather with obama supporters\\nthat evening in grant park.\\n\\nreferring to the tight races in 2000 and 2004, she said: \"it\\'s\\nlike charlie brown and the football: once, twice, a million times\\nburned. i\\'ll be in chicago because i either want to celebrate with\\nbarack or grieve with him.\"\\n\\npam young, a republican mother of three from fort worth, texas,\\nsaid she would probably have a few friends over. \"i think my guy\\nis going down for the count,\" she said, referring to sen. john\\nmccain. she has many liberal friends with whom she traded nyah-nyah\\ntext messages during the debates. on tuesday night, she said, with\\na sigh, \"they will abuse me with it.\"\\n\\nthe evening presents an emotional challenge for susan bodnar\\nschatsky, a manhattan democrat. she\\'ll be struggling to contain her\\nbattle-scarred cynicism, even as she encourages the excitement of\\nher children, 9 and 11, who baked money-raising cookies and knocked\\non doors in pennsylvania for obama. \"our kids need to be allowed\\nto idealize,\" she said. \"we\\'ll acknowledge that it\\'s a special,\\nfun night. but if it doesn\\'t work out, we need to have a protective\\nplace for their tears.\"\\n\\nbob casselman has his protective place ready. casselman, a\\nmiddle school teacher from zionsville, ind., said he was voting for\\nmccain but was apprehensive about the outcome of the evening, which\\nhe intended to spend at home with his wife. he has a shrinking\\nretirement account and two college tuitions to cover. \"i\\'ll\\ncertainly watch the returns,\" he said, \"but i\\'ll also be reading\\na fun book\" -- david baldacci\\'s \"stone cold\" -- \"so i can take my\\nmind off the serious stuff. i\\'ve been saving it for election\\nnight.\"\\n\\nby contrast, the ebullience of organizers of tuesday night\\'s\\nevents in wasilla and washington seemed unassailable. perhaps that\\nwas because they will be celebrating themselves as much as their\\ncandidates.\\n\\nin wasilla, mccain and the republican party seem like\\nafterthoughts, wafting after what is essentially a love-fest for\\nsarah palin and small-town alaska.\\n\\ntypically on an election night, said lynn gattis, an organizer\\nof the wasilla event, \"we go to a local bar or watch on our own\\ntvs, but this one is a big hoo-hah.\"\\n\\nthe festival will feature gun-safety sessions, a flag ceremony\\nfrom the boy scouts and vendors hawking palin memorabilia,\\nincluding wineglass charms -- trinkets to identify one\\'s glass at an\\nevent -- in shapes like lipstick and high-heeled shoes. the colony\\nhigh school marching band from nearby palmer will perform what\\ngattis contended would be a special preview.\\n\\n\"the band is going to the inaugural parade!\" gattis said. \"we\\nbought their uniforms on ebay, and they\\'ve been practicing. i\\'ve\\ngot my inaugural ball gown, tan-spray can and all.\"\\n\\nacross the country, fauntroy, a founding member of the\\ncongressional black caucus, sees in obama the fulfillment of a\\ndream more than 40 years old. \"this is the great harvest,\" he\\nsaid, his voice breaking. \"the moment for which martin luther king\\njr. gave his life. i\\'ve been saying to people ad nauseam: \\'pray and\\nthen vote. put feet to your prayers.\"\\'\\n\\nhe expects at least 500 people at new bethel on tuesday night.\\n\"i am so full of anticipation that i am ashamed of myself,\"\\nfauntroy said. \"i can almost hear the children singing and the\\nchurch bells ringing.\"\\n\\nas if to defuse their anxiety, some hosts have intentionally\\ncreated bipartisan guest lists. the marquee bipartisan party in new\\nyork is likely to be the one given by harvey weinstein, the ardent\\ndemocrat (and film and theater producer), and georgette mosbacher,\\nthe ardent republican (and top executive at borghese, the beauty\\ncompany), along with cindi leive (undeclared) and jim nelson\\n(democrat), the editors in chief, respectively, of glamour and gq.\\n\\nduring a conference call with mosbacher and weinstein, that\\nnotion of friendship trumping partisanship was almost savaged,\\nespecially when mosbacher, alluding to the candidates\\' tax\\nproposals, described herself as \"a small-business owner.\"\\n\\nweinstein all but gagged.\\n\\n\"i have a $100 million business,\" mosbacher explained. \"i\\nhave to make a payroll on the first and the 15th of the month!\"\\n\\ntheir guest list includes robert. m. morgenthau, the manhattan\\ndistrict attorney; eva mendes, the actress; and salman rushdie, the\\nwriter. there will be, weinstein chimed in, \"a lot of\\nsmall-business owners of

as far (strategies) mark hulbert is editor of the hulbert financial digest, a service of marketwatch.      critics of market timing argue that it\\'s hard, if not\\nimpossible, to consistently beat a buy-and-hold approach by jumping\\nback and forth between stocks and cash.\\n\\nbut new research raises the tantalizing possibility that you can\\ndo as well as the overall market -- with much less risk -- by parking\\nyour portfolio in the safety of cash during times like these, when\\nmarket volatility spikes higher.\\n\\nmarket timers have yet to translate this new research into a set\\nof specific rules for trading. but the general idea is to get out\\nof the stock market whenever volatility measures -- such as the\\nchicago board options exchange\\'s volatility index, known as the vix\\n-- rise significantly, and to stay in cash until they come back\\ndown.\\n\\nof course, such a volatility-avoidance strategy faces long odds.\\nas the critics of market timing often point out, the stock market\\ntends to produce the bulk of its gains in just a few explosive\\nsessions. miss those days and your portfolio\\'s returns are likely\\nto disappoint you.\\n\\nconsider someone who was fully invested in stocks over the last\\ndecade -- except for the market\\'s 20 best days, during which he held\\ncash. despite holding stocks more than 99 percent of the time, this\\ninvestor would have lost 57 percent through the end of october, as\\njudged by the dow jones wilshire 5000 index, a benchmark that\\nrepresents the combined value of all domestic stocks. that is 70\\npercentage points worse than the 13 percent gain he would have\\nachieved had he held stocks mimicking that index for the entire 10\\nyears, including the market\\'s 20 best days.\\n\\nmarket-timing advocates say it\\'s unfair to focus only on the\\nconsequences of missing the very best days, because the bulk of the\\nmarket\\'s declines are also concentrated in just a few sessions. for\\nexample, a portfolio fully invested in stocks during all but the 20\\nworst days of the last decade would have gained 215 percent. that\\'s\\nmore than 200 percentage points better than the return from a\\nstraightforward buy-and-hold approach.\\n\\nthe volatility-avoidance strategy takes the middle ground\\nbetween these two extremes. it aims to sidestep at least some of\\nthe market\\'s biggest down days and is willing to miss some of the\\nbiggest up days, too. because the best and worst days tend to\\nbalance each other out during volatile times, a strategy that moves\\nyour portfolio into cash during such periods should produce\\nlong-term returns that are close to those of the overall market,\\nwhile incurring much less risk.\\n\\nthis rough equivalence in returns has prevailed in recent years.\\nover the last decade, an investor who was out of the stock market\\nduring both the 20 best and 20 worst days would have gained 18\\npercent. that\\'s just a little better than buying and holding. yet\\nthe volatility of this investor\\'s monthly returns would have been 9\\nless than the market\\'s.\\n\\nbut how can you sidestep even a good portion of the biggest down\\ndays?\\n\\na growing body of academic research has found that the periods\\nof greatest volatility are in large part predictable. this means\\nthat the market sessions with particularly good or bad returns\\ndon\\'t occur randomly, but tend to be clustered together. (perhaps\\nthe researcher most widely credited with documenting this tendency\\nis robert f. engle, a finance professor at new york university who\\nwas the nobel laureate in economics in 2003 for his work along\\nthese lines.)\\n\\nthe market\\'s behavior over the last couple of months illustrates\\nthis clustering: by sept. 18, the vix, the widely followed\\nvolatility index, had climbed to what was then its highest level in\\nfive years, greatly increasing the likelihood that the ensuing\\nperiod would have above-average volatility. sure enough, nine of\\nthe 20 biggest daily percentage losses of the last decade occurred\\nin the subsequent six weeks, along with six of the decade\\'s 20\\nbiggest daily gains.\\n\\nbut even if they\\'re successful, volatility-avoidance strategies\\naren\\'t for everyone. long-term investors, for example, presumably\\ndon\\'t care about shorter-term gyrations, and therefore aren\\'t\\ninterested in market-timing approaches whose major benefit is\\nreducing volatility rather than increasing return. such strategies\\nrequire close attention to the market, and generate higher costs\\nthan simply holding stocks for the long term.\\n\\nstill, a successful volatility-avoidance strategy would appeal\\nto many investors who have been scared away from the market,\\nworried that they would suffer through more extraordinary\\nfluctuations like those of recent weeks.\\n\\nby its very nature, innovation is inefficient. while\\nblockbusters do emerge, few of the new products or processes that\\nevolve from innovative thinking ultimately survive the test of\\ntime. during periods of economic growth, such inefficiencies are\\nchalked up as part of the price of forging into the future.\\n\\nbut these aren\\'t such times. wild market gyrations, frozen\\ncredit markets and an overall sour economy herald a new round of\\ncorporate belt-tightening. foremost on the target list is anything\\ninefficient. that\\'s bad news for corporate innovation, and it could\\nspell trouble for years to come, even after the economy turns\\naround.\\n\\n\"to be honest, we had a problem with innovation even before the\\neconomic crisis. that\\'s the reason i wrote my book,\" says judy\\nestrin, former chief technology officer at cisco systems and author\\nof \"closing the innovation gap.\" \"we\\'re focusing on the short\\nterm and we\\'re not planting the seeds for the future.\"\\n\\nin tough times, of course, many companies have to scale back.\\nbut, she says: \"to quote obama, you don\\'t use a hatchet. you use a\\nscalpel. leaders need to pick and choose with great care.\"\\n\\nthere are important things managers can do to ensure that\\ncreative forward-thinking doesn\\'t go out the door with each round\\nof layoffs. fostering a companywide atmosphere of innovation --\\nencouraging everyone to take risks and to think about novel\\nsolutions, from receptionists to corner-suite executives -- helps\\nensure that the loss of any particular set of minds needn\\'t spell\\ntrouble for the entire company.\\n\\nshe suggests instilling five core values to entrench innovation\\nin the corporate mind-set: questioning, risk-taking, openness,\\npatience and trust. all five must be used together -- risk-taking\\nwithout questioning leads to recklessness, she says, while patience\\nwithout trust sets up an every-man-for-himself mentality.\\n\\nin an era of six sigma black belts and brown belts, estrin urges\\nsetting aside certain efficiency measures in favor of what she\\ncalls \"green-thumb leadership\" -- a future-oriented management\\nstyle that understands, and even encourages, taking risks. let\\nefficiency measures govern the existing \"factory farm,\" she says,\\nbut create greenhouses and experimental gardens along the sides of\\nthe farm to nurture the risky investments that likely will take a\\nnumber of years to bear fruit.\\n\\n\"i\\'m not suggesting you only cut from today\\'s stuff and keep\\nthe future part untouched,\" she says. \"you have to balance it.\"\\n\\nyet even that approach has its drawbacks. companies that create\\nsilos of innovation by designating one group as the \"big\\nthinkers\" while making others handle day-to-day concerns risk\\nlosing their innovative edge if any of the big thinkers leave the\\ncompany or ultimately must be laid off.\\n\\n\"innovation has to be embedded in the daily operation, in the\\nentire work force,\" says jon fisher, a business professor, serial\\nentrepreneur, and author of \"strategic entrepreneurism,\" which\\nadvocates building a start-up\\'s business from the beginning with an\\neye toward selling the company. \"a large acquirer\\'s interest in a\\nstartup or smaller company is binary in nature: they either want\\nyou or they don\\'t, based on the innovation you have to offer. the\\nbest way to foster innovation is to create something, put it to the\\ntest, build a good company and then get it under the umbrella of a\\nworld-renowned company to move it forward.\"\\n\\ndavid thompson, chief executive and co-founder of genius.com\\ninc., based in san mateo, calif., says that innovation \"has a bad\\nname in down times\" but that \"bad times focus the mind and the\\nbest-focused minds in the down times are looking for the\\nopportunities.\"\\n\\n\"you do have to batten down the hatches and reduce expenses,\\nbut you can\\'t do it at the expense of the big picture,\" thompson\\nadds. \"you always have to keep in mind the bigger picture that\\'s\\ncoming down the road in two or three years.\\n\\n\"the last thing you want to do with innovation is just throw\\nmoney at it. it\\'s a very tricky balance.\"\\n\\nin fact, hard times can be the source of innovative inspiration,\\nsays chris shipley, a technology analyst and executive producer of\\nthe demo conferences, where new ideas make their debuts. \"some of\\nthe best products and services come out of some of the worst\\ntimes,\" she says. in the early 1990s, tens of millions of dollars\\nhad gone down the drain in a futile effort to develop \"pen\\ncomputing\" -- an early phase of mobile computing -- and a recession\\nwas shriveling the economic outlook.\\n\\nyet the tiny palm computing managed to revitalize the entire\\nindustry in a matter of months by transforming itself overnight\\nfrom a software maker into a hardware company.\\n\\n\"our biggest challenge right now is fear,\" she says. \"the\\nworst thing that a company can do right now is go into hibernation,\\ninto duck-and-cover. if you just sit on your backside and wait for\\nthings to get better, they\\'re not going to. they\\'re going to get\\nbetter for somebody, but not necessarily for you.\"\\n\\nhoward lieberman, also a serial entrepreneur and founder of the\\nsilicon valley innovation institute, says innovation breeds\\neffectiveness. it\\'s not about efficiency, he argues.\\n\\n\"efficiency is for bean counters,\" he says. \"it\\'s not for\\nceos or inventors or founders.\"\\n\\nthe current economic downturn comes as no surprise to him, he\\nsays, because it mirrors the downturn at the time of the dot-com\\nbust. then and now, the companies that survive are those that keep\\ncreativity and innovation foremost.\\n\\n\"creativity doesn\\'t care about economic downturns,\" lieberman\\nsays. \"in the middle of the 1970s, when we were having a big\\neconomic downturn, both apple and microsoft were founded. creative\\npeople don\\'t care about the time or the season or the state of the\\neconomy; they just go out and do their thing.\"\\n\\nmarilyn rubinson recalls her stays at the\\nfontainebleau hotel as a series of high-fashion snapshots. there\\nwere afternoons at the cabana, \"a blue hotel towel wrapped around\\nmy head like a turban and wearing high-heeled lucite shoes,\" she\\nsaid. there were evenings at the gigi room, rubbing shoulders with\\nnew york\\'s dashing mayor, john v. lindsay; and she remembers\\nsweeping down the dramatic lobby staircase in a form-fitting,\\nstone-colored gown. \"in those days everyone made an entrance,\"\\nrubinson, 84, said. \"i made lots of entrances.\"\\n\\nin that heady era the hotel was the diadem of miami resorts, a\\n560-foot-long, sickle-shaped showplace dominating the collins\\navenue waterfront, where miamians like the rubinsons, who own a\\nchain of clothing stores, and well-to-do snowbirds came in the\\nwinter to roost.\\n\\n\"everyone who was anyone was there,\" rubinson said. \"people\\nwore black tie and jewelry. everyone was young.\"\\n\\nand everyone lived large at the flamboyant resort, conceived\\nfrom its outset to evoke a modern versailles. \"it was the place\\nfor entertainment, for glamour -- an icon even among the locals,\"\\nsaid cathy leff, the director of the wolfsonian museum of design\\nhere. \"even now if one asks, \\'within the city of miami beach, what\\nis the most important landmark in the popular imagination?\\' it\\nwould be the fontainebleau.\"\\n\\ncan an icon of the past be restored to its former glory? new\\nowners and architects of the fontainebleau have invested $1 billion\\nto buy and restore it in the conviction that it can. its original\\nfusion of modernist rigor and hollywood cheek, dreamed up by the\\nmaverick architect morris lapidus, was derided as bronx baroque,\\nuntil the singular style of miami beach was rediscovered by the ian\\nschrager generation.\\n\\n\"in its day in the \\'50s and \\'60s, the fontainebleau was state\\nof the art in glamour,\" said jeffrey beers, the new york architect\\nresponsible for an extensive update of the interior. \"we would\\nlike to restore that in spirit.\"\\n\\nwhen the refurbished resort is officially unveiled nov. 14 with\\na series of parties and a taping for television of a victoria\\'s\\nsecret fashion show -- perfect! -- visitors will be able to judge for\\nthemselves if the mission succeeded. even recently, as the hotel\\nwas still a construction site, it was clear that the old duchess\\nhad flounced out her skirts.\\n\\n\"how many places like this can you go in america that are not\\nin the desert?\" said jeffrey soffer, executive chairman and\\nmajority partner of fontainebleau resorts, which is building a\\nfontainebleau in las vegas. indeed, as he strolled the raised\\noceanfront walkway that overlooks the property, it was obvious the\\nresort had much in common with over-the-top hotels on the strip.\\n\\nvisible from the walkway is a pool complex fanning out across\\nthe lawns, and a new 40,000-square-foot glass-walled spa, its steam\\nrooms and reflecting pools worthy of the emperor hadrian.\\ncrescent-shaped rows of cabanas edge the pools and echo the\\nundulating outlines of the chateau, the hotel\\'s original building.\\n\\nseveral towers, two of them new, flank the chateau, for a\\ncombined 1,500 guest rooms, twice the number of the fontainebleau\\'s\\nlargest competitor, loews in south beach. there are also shops, 11\\nrestaurants and lounges, and about 200,000 square feet of meeting\\nand convention space -- all sprawling over 22 acres.\\n\\nthe three-year renovation was conceived, in part, to lure back\\nfashionable crowds, which have drifted down to south beach.\\n\\nwith renovated rooms from $399 and suites from $509, the\\nfontainebleau is reopening at a challenging time for tourism. hotel\\noccupancy rates in miami-dade county were down by 6 percent in\\nseptember from a year earlier, and room revenues fell by 4 percent,\\nsaid john lancet, a senior executive in miami for hvs, a national\\nhotel consulting company.\\n\\nbut lancet viewed the fontainebleau development as only mildly\\nrisky. \"it is my impression that the owners went through adequate\\nplanning so that the risk could be mitigated,\" he said.\\n\\nthe hotel has some $30 million in bookings through early next\\nyear, said howard c. karawan, the chief operating officer of\\nfontainebleau resorts, who was brought in by the new owners to\\noversee renovations and operations for the company.\\n\\nrumors are widespread that the $500 million face-lift was made\\nin anticipation that the city would legalize casino gambling. the\\ndevelopers deny this, and gambling has yet to win acceptance with\\nlawmakers.\\n\\nat the hub of the resort is the chateau\\'s 45,000-square-foot\\nlobby, an elaboration on the original free-form elliptical shape\\ncompleted by lapidus in 1954.\\n\\nits original curvaceous outlines were accentuated by three\\nenormous chandeliers, striated greek-style columns, swirling\\ncarpets and a mural of a piranesi print. the lobby\\'s famous focal\\npoint was a \"staircase to nowhere,\" which actually led from a\\ndiscreet cloakroom, where ladies could shed their wraps before\\ndescending divalike down the white marble steps.\\n\\nthe new lobby, like its predecessor, is a chambered nautilus,\\nall undulating walls and recesses. mr. beers stripped away \\'70s-era\\ncarpeting expose the original marble floor with its signature bow\\ntie design. he covered the wall at the staircase in gold tile and\\nadded a light installation by the artist james turrell and a lounge\\nwith a blue reflective floor. the staircase to nowhere is back, the\\njewel in a set piece expected to draw crowds who want to see and be\\nseen.\\n\\nand perhaps to retrace the footsteps of previous guests. those\\nwho stayed at the hotel in miami beach\\'s golden age recall a resort\\nthat lapidus, who died in 2001 at 98, had envisioned as a\\nlaboratory. it was a place, he wrote, \"where i could enlarge upon\\nall the theories i had been developing about human nature and the\\nemotional hunger that the average man had for visual excitement.\"\\n\\nat bars and supper clubs -- the gigi room, the poodle lounge --\\n\"women would sit with their little fur stoles and white gloves on\\nto eat,\" recalled deborah desilets, a miami architect and former\\nassociate of lapidus. sheathed in slinky gowns, \"they would stop\\nat the mezzanine, put on their jewelry and wave at their husbands\\nin the lobby below,\" she said.\\n\\nmichelle oka doner, an artist and a frequent guest as a girl --\\nher father, kenneth oka, was mayor of miami beach in the late \\'50s\\nand early \\'60s -- remembers the resort, where she had a prom and her\\nwedding, \"as my stage and my launching pad.\"\\n\\nthe fontainebleau was a decadent paradise of \"flashy diamonds,\\nillicit sex and overflowing ice cream sodas,\" she said. to get to\\nher family\\'s cabana, \"you had to walk through the downstairs shops\\nand past a dance studio where they had all these gorgeous guys\\ngiving cha-cha lessons to all these overdressed matrons from\\nscarsdale.\"\\n\\n\"people came for the half-naked girls and the revues,\" she\\nsaid. and, of course, for trysts. \"i knew something illicit was\\ngoing on, but i couldn\\'t put my finger on what it was.\"\\n\\nthe lobby was a hub for celebrity spotting, the hotel itself a\\nbackdrop against which the rat pack played poker and james bond\\nsprang from the high dive in \"goldfinger.\"\\n\\n\"the floor was like a mirror, so shiny you could see\\nyourself,\" said levi forte, a bellman at the fontainebleau since\\nthe \\'60s. \"danny thomas couldn\\'t keep his eyes off that floor.\\nhe\\'d sit there and comb his hair and ask, \\'levi, how do i look?\"\\'\\n\\nmel dick, who moved to miami from brooklyn in the \\'60s, visited\\non his honeymoon. he recalled being drawn to a sign outside the\\nhotel barbershop that beckoned, \"come and have your shoes shined\\nby the former lightweight champion of the world.\" it was sidney\\nwalker, known as beau jack, recalled dick, a wine company\\nexecutive. \"i sat down in the seat and i gave him five dollars. i\\ntold him: \\'i don\\'t want you to shine my shoes. i just want to look\\nat you.\"\\'\\n\\nrubinson was just as enthralled by her frequent star sightings.\\n\"how many times driving up to the fontainebleau i would see frank\\nsinatra walking up the drive with a glass in his hand,\" she said.\\n\\n\"we had a more glamorous lifestyle in those days,\" she added\\nwistfully. \"but then, of course, things changed.\"\\n\\nin succeeding decades the resort lost its sparkle. like other\\nsupersize hotels lining collins avenue north of 44th street,\\nincluding the neighboring eden roc, another shiny lapidus edifice,\\nit became as dated as grandma\\'s minaudiere.\\n\\nfast forward to the current renovation. \"we kept asking\\nourselves, \\'what would morris do?\"\\' karawan said.\\n\\njohn nichols, a miami architect responsible for the adjacent\\nfontainebleau residential towers, the second of which has just been\\ncompleted, was hired to gut and redesign the hotel. he preserved\\nlapidus embellishments like the perforated \"swiss cheese\" outer\\nwalls. \"we had to get down into a very high level of detail,\"\\nnichols said. \"you don\\'t just go in there and take off the\\neyebrows.\"\\n\\noka doner said she admires the renovation -- to a point. \"the\\nproperty is kind of post-postmodern,\" she said. \"morris lapidus\\nhad real passion,\" but in its current incarnation, \"irony has\\ntrumped passion.\"\\n\\nbut desilets, the former lapidus associate, who visited the site\\nlast month, was over the moon. \"they used incredible engineering\\nto laser trace what was there and rebuilt it with accuracy,\" she\\nsaid. \"it\\'s going to be like a ravenna mosaic. it\\'s a wow type of\\nextravagance.\"\\n\\nthe exuberant aesthetic of the original has been resurrected in\\nthree ballrooms, lavish restaurants and five swimming and\\nreflecting pools.\\n\\nthe pool cabanas have wraparound sofas and flat-panel\\ntelevisions. perched on the property\\'s topmost tier is a vip pool\\ndeck with six additional teak cabanas, a bar and a dj booth.\\n\\nforte, the bellman, recently viewed the improvements. \"the\\nplace is so pretty, the first time i saw it i thought i was in the\\nwrong hotel,\" he said. \"i said to my wife, \\'just take a look at\\nwhat money can do.\"\\'\\n\\nas a senior mortgage underwriter, keysha cooper was proud of her\\nability to spot fraud and other problems in a loan application. a\\ndecade of vetting mortgage documents had taught her plenty, she\\nsays.\\n\\nbut as a senior mortgage underwriter at washington mutual during\\nthe late, great mortgage boom, cooper says she found herself in a\\nvise. brokers squeezed her from one side, her superiors from the\\nother, she says, and both pressured her to approve loans, no matter\\nwhat.\\n\\n\"at wamu it wasn\\'t about the quality of the loans; it was about\\nthe numbers,\" cooper says. \"they didn\\'t care if we were giving\\nloans to people that didn\\'t qualify. instead, it was how many loans\\ndid you guys close and fund?\"\\n\\ncooper, 35, was laid off a year ago and is still unemployed. she\\ncame forward to discuss her experiences at the bank to help\\nshareholders recover money from wamu executives.\\n\\ncooper is one of 89 employees whose stories fill a voluminous\\ncomplaint filed against officers of the company by the ontario\\nteachers\\' pension plan board, a big shareholder. topping the list\\nof defendants is kerry k. killinger, the wamu chief executive who\\nwas ousted in mid-september.\\n\\nwamu was seized by federal regulators in late september, the\\nbiggest bank failure in the nation\\'s history. it was sold to\\njpmorgan chase for $1.9 billion.\\n\\nthe shareholder complaint depicts wamu\\'s mortgage lending\\noperation as a boiler room where volume was paramount and\\nquestionable loans were pushed through because they were more\\nprofitable to the company.\\n\\nwhen underwriters refused to approve dubious loans, they were\\npunished, she says.\\n\\ncooper started at wamu in 2003 and lasted three and a half\\nyears. at first, she was allowed to do her job, she says. in\\nfebruary 2007, though, the pressure became intense. wamu executives\\ntold employees they were not making enough loans and had to get\\ntheir numbers up, she says.\\n\\n\"they started giving loan officers free trips if they closed so\\nmany loans, fly them to hawaii for a month,\" cooper recalls. \"one\\nof my account reps went to jamaica for a month because he closed\\n$3.5 million in loans that month.\"\\n\\nalthough cooper couldn\\'t see it, the wheels were already coming\\noff the subprime bus.\\n\\n\"if a loan came from a top loan officer, they didn\\'t care what\\nthe situation was, you had to make that loan work,\" she says.\\n\"you were like a bad person if you declined a loan.\"\\n\\none loan file was filled with so many discrepancies that she\\nfelt certain it involved mortgage fraud. she turned the loan down,\\nshe says, only to be scolded by her supervisor.\\n\\n\"she told me, \\'this broker has closed over $1 million with us\\nand there is no reason you cannot make this loan work,\"\\' cooper\\nsays. \"i explained to her the loan was not good at all, but she\\nsaid i had to sign it.\"\\n\\nthe argument did not end there, however. cooper says her\\nimmediate boss complained to the team manager about the loan\\nrejection and asked that cooper be \"written up,\" with a formal\\nletter of complaint placed in her personnel file.\\n\\ncooper said the team manager told her to \"restructure\" the\\nloan to make it work. \"i said, how can you restructure fraud? this\\nis a fraudulent loan,\" she recalls.\\n\\ncooper says that her bosses placed her on probation for 30 days\\nfor refusing to approve the loan and that her team manager signed\\noff on the loan.\\n\\nfour months later, the loan was in default, she says. the\\nborrower had not made a single payment. \"they tried to hang it on\\nme,\" cooper said, \"but i said, \\'no, i put in the system that i am\\nnot approving this loan.\"\\'\\n\\nbrokers often tried to bribe cooper to approve loans, she says.\\none offered to pay $900 to send her son to football summer boot\\ncamp if she would approve a loan that had been declined by a host\\nof other lenders. \"i told him no and not to disrespect me like\\nthat again,\" cooper says.\\n\\nhidden fees meant brokers could easily make between $20,000 and\\n$40,000 on a $500,000 loan, cooper says.\\n\\n\"wamu was allowing brokers to get 6 to 8 percent off one\\nloan,\" she says. \"if i had a loan where the borrower was already\\ntight and then i saw the broker is getting $10,000 or $20,000, i\\nwould cut their fees back. they would get so upset with me.\"\\n\\ncooper says that loans she turned down were often approved by\\nher superiors. one in particular came back to haunt wamu.\\n\\nvetting a loan one day, cooper says she became suspicious when a\\nphotograph of the house being bought showed one street address\\nwhile documents deeper in the file showed a different address. she\\ncontacted the appraiser, and recalls that he said that he must have\\nerred and that he would send her the correct documents.\\n\\n\"so then he sent me an appraisal with a picture of the same\\nhouse but this time with the right number on it,\" cooper recalls.\\n\"i looked the address up in our system and could not find it. i\\ncalled the appraiser and said, \\'please investigate.\"\\'\\n\\nthe appraiser came back, reporting that a visit to the\\ncalifornia property had found everything in order and in agreement\\nwith the original appraisal. \"i was so for sure that it was fraud\\ni wanted to get on an airplane,\" cooper says.\\n\\nthe $800,000 loan was approved, but not by cooper. six months\\nlater, it defaulted, she says. \"when they went to foreclose on the\\nhouse, they found it was an empty lot,\" she recalls. \"i remember\\nclear as day this manager comes over to me and asks, \\'do you\\nremember this loan?\\' i knew just what she was talking about.\"\\n\\nrejecting loan after loan, however, gave her battle fatigue.\\n\"the more you fight, the more you get in trouble,\" she says. she\\nwas written up three or four times at wamu.\\n\\nafter wamu\\'s mortgage lending unit laid her off, she applied for\\nwork in its retail banking division. she was turned down, she\\nsuspects, because of the critical letters in her personnel file.\\n\\ncooper\\'s biggest regret, she says, is that she did not reject\\nmore loans. \"i swear 60 percent of the loans i approved i was made\\nto,\" she says. \"if i could get everyone\\'s name, i would write\\nthem apology letters.\"\\n\\nchad johnson, a partner at bernstein, litowitz berger &amp;amp;\\ngrossmann, is lead counsel for shareholders in the suit. he said:\\n\"killinger pocketed tens of millions of dollars from wamu, while\\ninvestors were left with worthless stock.\" with wamu gone, he\\nadded, \"it is all the more important that killinger and his\\nco-defendants are held accountable.\"\\n\\nthe lawyer representing wamu and killinger did not return a\\nphone call seeking comment.\\n\\ncooper hopes to return to the mortgage business soon. \"i loved\\nunderwriting because it\\'s about being able to put a person in their\\ndream home,\" she says. \"but messing these borrowers around was\\nwrong.\"\\n\\nit is 10:30 a.m., two hours before the florida gators will kick\\noff to ole miss, and max, a 19-year-old freshman, is laboring to\\nexplain how he feels about the drinking age.\\n\\n\"per-son-al-ly,\" he says, punching out each slurred syllable,\\n\"i do agree the age should be lowered. it will cut down on binge\\ndrinking.\" he throws an arm around a fraternity brother. \"but we\\ntake care of each other. we will not let anyone drink under the\\ninfluence.\" he pauses. \"i mean drive under the influence. i\\'m\\nsorry. i\\'m drunk already. it\\'s been a long morning.\"\\n\\nmax and his brothers are pre-gaming. a dozen of them strut about\\nthe courtyard of their house on the university of florida\\'s\\nfraternity row, each nursing a cold beer in a foam hugger. a\\nfrisbee flies as jimi hendrix blares from the loudspeakers.\\n\\nthe only thing unusual about this day\\'s pre-gaming is that it\\nactually precedes a game. in the two decades since the legal\\ndrinking age was raised to 21, the term has come to encompass any\\nrapid consumption of alcohol in private before venturing out to\\nvenues where drinking may not be possible.\\n\\nthis assumes that alcohol is readily available to underage\\ncollege students, which of course it is. as ever, older students\\nprovide liquor to friends who are younger, and fake ids remain as\\npervasive on campus as sweatpants.\\n\\nthough college drinking levels have declined slightly from peaks\\nin the early 1980s, surveys find that more than 8 in 10 college\\nstudents drink and that 4 in 10 are binge drinkers (meaning that in\\nthe previous two weeks a man had consumed at least five drinks in a\\nsitting, or a woman four).\\n\\nhere in gainesville, binge drinking remains ritualized behavior\\nfor many of the 51,000 students, even as admission to the\\nuniversity has become increasingly selective. whether or not the\\nuniversity deserves its princeton review ranking as this year\\'s\\nbest party school, few in this classic college town find it\\noutlandish that the gators have placed in the top 20 four years\\nrunning. to walk the campus and environs on a football weekend is\\nto navigate an endless river of alcohol, from the flowing taps of\\nthe swamp restaurant, a popular hangout near the stadium, to the\\noff-campus bungalow on northwest second avenue that houses one of\\nthe world\\'s larger beer bongs.\\n\\ncollege presidents, while philosophical about the historical\\nbonds between academe and alcohol, are immensely frustrated by the\\nuniversal flouting of the law and the persistence of binge\\ndrinking. each year, they see its tragic consequences in the form\\nof alcohol poisonings, drunken-driving arrests, date rapes and\\nbarroom brawls. even at universities, like florida, that make\\naggressive efforts at enforcement and education, administrators say\\nthey believe success is limited to the margins.\\n\\nand so this summer, 130 exasperated college presidents, many\\nfrom the country\\'s most prestigious institutions, boldly shifted\\nthe debate by calling for a re-examination of the drinking age. in\\njuly, they signed a manifesto, declaring that \"21 is not working\"\\nand asserting that \"a culture of dangerous, clandestine\\n\\'binge-drinking\\' -- often conducted off campus -- has developed.\"\\n\\nin their open letter, labeled the amethyst initiative after the\\nviolet gemstone thought by the greeks to ward off intoxication,\\nthey did not explicitly call for lowering the age from 21. but the\\neffort\\'s organizer, john m. mccardell jr., the former president of\\nmiddlebury college, directs a nonprofit group that calls for\\nlicensing drinkers as young as 18. like drivers, they would first\\nhave to pass a course on responsible alcohol use.\\n\\npolls have found little support for lowering the drinking age.\\nbut with surveys showing that three-fourths of high school seniors\\nhave consumed alcohol, mccardell argues that the law is so\\nmeaningless as to breed disrespect. his proposal, he says, would\\nprovide a mechanism for educating youth on the perils of binge\\ndrinking while removing the forbidden-fruit incentive that he says\\ncontributes to it.\\n\\n\"if you assume, and i think you have to assume, that alcohol is\\na reality in the lives of 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, then you\\'ve\\ngot two choices,\" mccardell says. \"you can try to change the\\nreality. we\\'ve been trying to do that for 24 years and haven\\'t been\\nthat successful. that leaves creating the safest possible\\nenvironment for the reality. and there\\'s plenty of evidence to\\nsupport that 21 doesn\\'t do that.\"\\n\\nhe adds: \"we can\\'t know that 18 would improve binge drinking,\\nbut we can\\'t know that it would fail either. if we were able to\\ndraw one at-risk life out of the shadows and into the sunlight,\\nwould the change be worth it?\"\\n\\nit is not a rhetorical question. one recent government study\\nestimated that 1,700 college students die each year in\\nalcohol-related incidents, more than 599,000 are injured and more\\nthan 97,000 are victims of an alcohol-fueled sexual assault or date\\nrape.\\n\\nin recent surveys by the university of florida\\'s health care\\ncenter, about a third of students said they had blacked out from\\nheavy drinking in the past year, half said they had vomited, a\\nfourth said they had gotten into an alcohol-related fight and more\\nthan a fifth reported driving under the influence.\\n\\nbut alexander c. wagenaar, a university of florida\\nepidemiologist who has studied the drinking age for more than two\\ndecades, says mccardell ignores evidence that raising the age has\\nsaved lives, especially on the roads. the national highway\\ntransportation safety administration estimates that despite poor\\nadherence to drinking age restrictions, each year about 900 fewer\\npeople die because the legal age is 21.\\n\\nafter assessing 48 studies, wagenaar concluded, \"the\\npreponderance of evidence suggests that higher drinking ages reduce\\nalcohol consumption.\" furthermore, he says, there is no\\nstatistical evidence that binge drinking increases along with the\\nrising legal age, or that it will decline with a drop. indeed, an\\nannual university of michigan survey shows that binge drinking\\namong college students actually peaked in 1984 and has fallen\\nsince, albeit slightly.\\n\\nas it happens, that is the year congress threatened to reduce\\nhighway money for states that did not raise the drinking age to 21.\\nmost of the country had designated 21 as the drinking age after\\nprohibition; then 29 states lowered it during the early 1970s, when\\n18-year-old draftees were being shipped to vietnam. studies soon\\nshowed an increase in traffic accidents among teenagers, and by\\n1988 all states had returned to 21.\\n\\nthe amethyst initiative\\'s signatories include the presidents or\\nchancellors of bennington, colgate, dartmouth, duke, johns hopkins,\\nohio state, syracuse, tufts and the university systems of maryland\\nand massachusetts. they do not include j. bernard machen, who\\nassumed the presidency at florida in 2004.\\n\\nin august, machen and his vice president for student affairs,\\npatricia telles-irvin, bluntly rejected the initiative in an op-ed\\npiece in the st. petersburg times. there was no evidence, they\\nwrote, that the 21 age limit encouraged more clandestine binge\\ndrinking than it discouraged and every reason to think that\\nlowering the age might exacerbate the problem.\\n\\n\"does anyone really think that if 18-year-olds could buy\\nalcohol, the social passport conferred by heavy drinking would lose\\nits cachet?\" they asked.\\n\\nthere has been much to celebrate on this sports-crazed campus\\nsince machen\\'s arrival. the gators won the ncaa football\\nchampionship in 2006 and back-to-back basketball championships in\\n2006 and 2007. the quarterback tim tebow brought home last year\\'s\\nheisman trophy as the outstanding college player.\\n\\nacademically, the state\\'s flagship university is becoming more\\nselective in its admissions. with a lottery-financed scholarship\\nprogram providing free tuition to almost all in-state freshmen, the\\nuniversity is twice as selective as it was 15 years ago, admitting\\nfewer than 4 in 10 applicants. the percentage of freshmen scoring\\nat least a 600 on the critical reading portion of the sat has\\nsoared to 70 percent, from 16 percent in 1993.\\n\\nmachen had not planned on becoming a crusader against binge\\ndrinking when he left the presidency of the university of utah,\\nwhere alcohol was hardly a problem. he had spent much of his career\\nas a dean of dentistry, and the florida trustees had hired him to\\nfocus on graduate education and academic ranking.\\n\\nbut in his first two years in gainesville, six students died in\\nalcohol-related incidents -- one from alcohol poisoning, two in\\nfalls, two in traffic accidents and one in a fight. as he met their\\nfamilies, he started to take the waste of promise personally.\\n\\n\"that\\'s when i said, \\'wait a minute,\"\\' machen says. \"the\\nintensity of those interactions made me want to take some effort in\\nthis area. it wasn\\'t anything i wanted to do, to be honest. a lot\\nof presidents are counseled against doing this because of the\\nnegative interactions you have with the student body. but we\\nthought we had to.\"\\n\\nmachen fears that florida\\'s party-school reputation is holding\\nback its academic ambition. but he is realistic about his ability\\nto alter a deeply ingrained culture. he emphasizes that he is \"not\\ninto abstinence\" and that he supports \"responsible drinking\" as\\npart of a student\\'s preparation for life. but seeing what he has\\nseen, he cannot wave the white flag. \"the ones who are in danger\\nof being habitually affected by it are the ones we\\'d like to get\\nafter,\" he says. \"i think maybe at the margin, for the really\\nsignificantly affected kids, we might make some difference.\"\\n\\nmachen has watched his campus\\' binge-drinking rate drop -- to 38\\npercent last spring from 57 percent in fall 2004 -- as the\\nuniversity has toughened enforcement, mandated alcohol education\\nand banned beer advertising, among other initiatives. a number of\\nother colleges have taken similar multidimensional approaches, and\\na third ban alcohol on campus altogether.\\n\\nit is allowed at the university of florida. but in september,\\nthe trustees clarified long-standing prohibitions against\\n\"common-source containers,\" like kegs, as well as \"excessive\\nrapid consumption.\" that regulation bans drinking games like beer\\npong (in which contestants toss table-tennis balls into beer-filled\\ncups, forcing their opponents to chug), keg standing (in which the\\ndrinker is held inverted over an open tap) and alcohol luges (in\\nwhich shots of liquor slalom down an ice block).\\n\\nsince 2006, the university has required freshmen to pass a\\n90-minute online alcohol education course before registering for\\nspring semester. the year before, it banned alcohol ads from sports\\nevents, concerts and broadcasts of athletic events (when it has\\ncontractual control). the school is now drafting a policy to\\nclarify that intoxicated students who are brought to an emergency\\nroom will not be reported to the university judicial system.\\n\\nwith the help of a federal grant and advice from students, the\\ncampus health center has papered buses with messages cautioning\\nagainst binge drinking. one provocative advertisement warns of\\n\"sketchy drunk guys.\" another depicts a woman bent over a commode\\nand pleads: \"don\\'t be that girl!\" a third, showing a beer bottle\\nwith a flaccid neck, advises that \"drinking too much may\\ndisappoint you ... and your partner.\" the ads are designed to\\nchange students\\' perceptions of what constitutes normal behavior, a\\nnational movement that has become all the rage in campaigns against\\nbinge drinking.\\n\\nthe university also stages alcohol-free \"gator nights\" on\\nfridays, with films, carnival games and a midnight breakfast that\\ntypically attract more than 1,000 students. free food seems to be a\\nmajor draw. when the funnel-cake maker announced at 11 p.m. that he\\nhad run out of batter, a long line of students let out a collective\\ngroan and dispersed.\\n\\n\"everyone\\'s off to the kegger,\" observed justine r.\\nmcconville, a sophomore from fort myers, fla.\\n\\nher classmate, brad e. ibach, agreed: \"there\\'s no keeping this\\ncrowd here now.\"\\n\\nthe university and the city have had little success convincing\\ntavern owners to stop luring cash-strapped students with\\ntwo-for-one specials and ladies night promotions. they are now\\nworking on an ordinance that would force bars to obtain licenses to\\nadmit underage patrons, under threat of revocation if the police\\ncatch minors being served.\\n\\nthe university accommodates reality by providing buses -- the\\n\"later gator\" -- to transport students who stagger out of the bars\\nat the 2 a.m. closing time, and taxi stands have been added. but\\nthe campus, city and county police vigorously enforce the underage\\ndrinking and open-container laws.\\n\\nmachen says there has been a noticeable toughening since april\\n3, 2007, the day after the gators won their second consecutive ncaa\\nbasketball title. amid the celebration, an intoxicated student from\\nanother university drove his pickup truck onto a closed street and\\nstruck and killed a gainesville police lieutenant.\\n\\nin a city of 114,000 full-time residents, the university and\\ncity police made 2,190 arrests for alcohol-related offenses last\\nyear. the police cannot say how many violators were students, but\\nthe university judicial system heard 419 cases. more than 50\\narrests were made during this year\\'s ole miss weekend in september,\\nwhich was muted by the gators\\' loss.\\n\\non game days, campus cops patrol fraternity row by bicycle. on\\nweekend nights, the gainesville police department\\'s \"party\\npatrol\" busts up loud parties when neighbors complain. other\\nofficers roam the teeming bars and clubs, checking driver\\'s\\nlicenses with flashlights.\\n\\n\"this day and age, they all look young to me, so i\\'m checking\\neverybody,\" says cpl. tscharna m. senn, squeezing through bodies\\nat a club called gotham, one of 32 bars in the compact downtown\\ndistrict.\\n\\nto maximize the deterrent effect, senn and her fellow officers\\ncuff offenders\\' hands behind their backs for a perp walk in front\\nof their friends. when the police went fishing at the swamp one\\nwednesday night in mid-september, they hauled out 10 underage\\ndrinkers, half of them members of the student government.\\n\\ndavid n. khey, a doctoral student in criminology, has calculated\\nthat at least 1 of every 20 florida students who arrived as\\nfreshmen in 2004 had an arrest record by the end of 2007, usually\\nfor an alcohol offense. a university spokesman says that it does\\nnot keep such records but that khey\\'s estimate seems high.\\n\\noffenders facing the university judicial system may have to sit\\nthrough a seminar or perform community service, with suspensions\\nand expulsions reserved for serious offenses like driving under the\\ninfluence. underage drinkers caught by city police typically face a\\nfine of $75 to $125.\\n\\npossession of a fake or doctored driver\\'s license is a felony.\\nas a result, students have learned it is wiser to borrow -- or buy --\\na driver\\'s license from an older friend who bears a vague\\nresemblance, as possession of another person\\'s id is only a\\nmisdemeanor.\\n\\nsome students say the risk is manageable.\\n\\n\"it\\'s effortless to get a drink in a bar,\" says lydia a.\\nsnyder, 22, a graduate student who also attended florida as an\\nundergraduate. \"i had a fake id and got turned away once in five\\nyears.\"\\n\\nfor others, the threat of a criminal record is sufficient to\\ndeter them in public, and so they pre-game instead, doing their\\nheaviest drinking behind closed doors before heading to a bar or\\nclub.\\n\\n\"you want to get drunk enough to last your time at the bar,\"\\nexplains joe d. alleva, a 19-year-old freshman from daytona beach,\\nfla. \"you want to get hammered drunk.\"\\n\\nsupply and demand also dictates that minors drink quickly and\\nheavily, says justin a. willems, an 18-year-old freshman. \"if\\nyou\\'re under 21 and go to a party and there\\'s alcohol,\" he says,\\n\"you don\\'t know when you\\'re going to see it again.\"\\n\\nstudents seem to universally agree that the current law is\\nineffectual, and that it may encourage binge drinking. with 18-,\\n19- and 20-year-olds serving overseas once again, they wonder why\\nsomeone old enough to fight is not old enough to drink.\\n\\nbut they also question whether they would drink any less if the\\nage was 18.\\n\\n\"there\\'s some truth that when you\\'re underage you\\'re a little\\nmore cautious,\" snyder says. \"lowering the drinking age would\\njust give people free rein.\"\\n\\nbrett bonds, 21, a senior from jacksonville, fla., adds: \"i\\ndon\\'t think a number is really going to stop binge drinking.\"\\n\\nheavy drinking, the students say, is simply part of college\\nculture. and buying alcohol by the keg or six-pack has one appeal\\nthat transcends age: it is cheaper than buying rounds at a bar.\\n\\nthat helps explain the happy postgame crowd at gary j. anthony\\'s\\noff-campus house, site of a weekly party that features an\\ningeniously engineered beer bong. on this weekend, the rube\\ngoldberg contraption is forcing a stream of natural light up a\\n20-foot tower, then down plastic tubes into 40 waiting mouths. (two\\nweeks later, for the game against louisiana state, the bong was\\nexpanded to 100 tubes.)\\n\\nas at other student gatherings, machen is not very popular here.\\nsome students call him a \"control freak.\" others assume, because\\nhe came from utah, that he is a mormon teetotaler, though he is\\nneither. in mock tribute, a local bar has christened a drink \"the\\nbernie.\"\\n\\n\"he\\'s trying to turn uf into the ivy league, all academics,\"\\ncomplains anthony, 22, a junior majoring in advertising.\\n\\ntelles-irvin, the vice president for student affairs, takes a\\ndifferent view. \"it\\'s an uphill battle, but it\\'s a mountain worth\\nclimbing,\" she says. \"i remember some students coming to me and\\nsaying, \\'you\\'re just trying to ruin our fun.\\' and i said, \\'no, i\\'m\\njust trying to keep you alive.\"\\'\\n\\nfor their wedding at oz farm in mendocino county, calif., kate\\nschatz and jason pontius came up with unusual gift baskets, which\\nincluded head lamps, flashlights, walkie-talkies and other items\\nbetter suited for construction workers than teary-eyed guests.\\n\\nbut this was a farm wedding, without hotel-like amenities, and\\nthe couple from oakland, calif., wanted to make the 30 or so\\nfriends and relatives staying the weekend as comfortable as\\npossible.\\n\\nunfortunately, they forgot about the bats.\\n\\n\"there were eight bats in our cabin and we had no idea how to\\nget them out,\" said julia mayer, 29, who was rooming with her\\nboyfriend and three other guests. \"one of us had a head lamp on,\\nso they were flying in our faces. we opened the window and tried to\\nturn off the lights, but nobody could see anything. we slept\\nsomewhere else.\"\\n\\nweddings celebrated at farms are not exactly new, but just as\\nthe wine craze decades ago sparked a vineyard wedding industry, the\\ngreen crusade, with its emphasis on organic and local products,\\nseems to be spurring interest in farms as the ideal venue for vows.\\n\\nbut these weddings are not for every bride and groom. the couple\\nmust want not only an outdoor setting, but also a close -- some\\nmight say too close -- connection with the land. while working farms\\nmay offer romantic sunsets over golden fields, and truly local,\\norganic food and flowers, couples must also be game for some rural\\nchallenges, like uncertain electricity and plumbing and the\\noccasional runaway chicken or pig, not to mention a family of bats.\\n\\nin other words, bridezillas need not bother.\\n\\n\"if you\\'re the kind of person who wants everything to work out\\nexactly right, i wouldn\\'t let you have it here,\" said judy\\nlessler, the owner of harland\\'s creek farm, a historic site in\\npittsboro, n.c., which she is preparing for weddings starting next\\nyear. \"this venue is for people who like the outdoors, love the\\nromance of it and are willing to be somewhat flexible.\"\\n\\nthe farm as a wedding site owes much to agritourism. about\\n50,000 farms, or roughly 2 percent of all farming operations in the\\ncountry, were open to the public in 2004, offering weddings,\\nlodging, hayrides and horseback riding, according to a survey\\nreleased last year by the department of agriculture. the survey is\\nthe first to quantify farm-based recreation.\\n\\nwhile some farms hold only a few weddings a year, others can\\'t\\nkeep up with demand. kruger\\'s farm, on a river island near\\nportland, ore., started holding weddings six years ago and as many\\nas 50 weddings are now held there annually. it has requests for\\nthree times that many, said don kruger, the owner.\\n\\n\"the response has been startling,\" kruger said. \"it\\'s kind of\\nan earthy crowd, in their 20s and 30s, educated, who have very\\nstrong leanings toward the environment.\\n\\nmillie martini bratten, editor in chief of brides magazine, said\\nthat while the majority of weddings still take place in traditional\\nsites like restaurants and country clubs, her magazine regularly\\nreceives wedding submissions set in farms and ranches.\\n\\n\"people want a relaxed atmosphere and they want to have fun,\"\\nsaid jane eckert, an agritourism consultant who last summer\\nlaunched ruralbounty.com, a database of farms, ranches, wineries\\nand other sites open to the public.\\n\\nschatz, 30, and pontius, 38, who invited 140 guests, were also\\ndrawn to the idea that all their organic flowers, salad greens,\\nherbs and apples for pies (in lieu of the wedding cake) were grown\\nat oz farm, which is host to a few weddings a year.\\n\\n\"we wanted to support a farm that does this organic work rather\\nthan have the money going to a hotel,\" said schatz, a fiction\\nwriter who lectures at the university of california, santa cruz.\\n\\nschatz and pontius, a web designer, also liked the laid-back\\nattitude. they could decorate any way they wanted, sing karaoke in\\nthe barn as late as they wished and generally have the run of the\\nplace. \"we spent half the time on a river drinking beer,\" pontius\\nsaid.\\n\\nfarm weddings can cost a fraction of nuptials at more\\ntraditional sites, because couples usually take care of services\\nlike catering and music. and small farmers like pulling out the\\nhay-covered welcome wagon because it helps them survive.\\n\\n\"this is the future,\" said kruger, noting these activities\\nprovide a third of kruger farm\\'s net income. \"it\\'s what farms are\\ndoing to try to make it.\"\\n\\nat oz farm, weddings and retreats provide half the farm\\'s\\nrevenues. \"it\\'s been a big help,\" said shauna boyd, who leases\\nthe business with her husband.\\n\\nbut farms trying to expand their operations beyond the strictly\\nagricultural sometimes face opposition from neighbors or county\\nofficials worried about issues like increased traffic, and find\\nthemselves battling zoning and land-use laws.\\n\\n\"crowds can sometimes surprise farmers new to agritourism,\"\\nsaid barbara berst adams, author of \"the new agritourism: hosting\\ncommunity and tourists on your farm.\" \"people need bathrooms,\\nfirst-aid kits and a place for trash. city kids don\\'t seem to know\\nthe goats aren\\'t video games -- they can bite back. and liability\\ncoverage for both the bride and groom and the farmer really are\\nissues that need to have been dealt with ahead of time.\"\\n\\nnot every farm wedding is glamour free. george w. winborn and\\nglenn goodfellow, of portland, ore., wanted a kentucky derby-style\\ngarden party with women in hats and chiffon and men in seersucker\\nsuits. the couple staged their stylish celebration at kruger\\'s last\\naugust with 135 guests on a lawn surrounded by a field of dahlias,\\nblueberries, a pigpen and chicken coop. the two grooms made the\\ncloth napkins, centerpieces and hand-stamped place cards, while\\nfriends made the desserts and party favors.\\n\\n\"we\\'re a very do-it-yourself couple and there was a lot of room\\nfor us to leave our mark on it,\" said winborn, 35, a writer.\\n\\nthe setting was a throwback to the grooms\\' childhood. winborn\\ngrew up on his grandparents\\' farm in arkansas and goodfellow, 31, a\\nbaker, spent summers in farm camps and visiting family in north\\ndakota. winborn is an expert chicken coop builder who raised\\nchickens in the couple\\'s backyard when they lived in dallas.\\n\\n\"people would joke, \\'you\\'ll have chicken ring bearers,\"\\'\\ngoodfellow said. \"some people couldn\\'t comprehend that we were\\nhaving a relatively upscale wedding in that location.\"\\n\\nthey asked, \"\\'do i have to wear a tie?\\' of course you have to\\nwear a tie,\" he said he told guests.\\n\\ntruth be told, some guests must be humored.\\n\\njodi levy, 29, a designer of gymnastics apparel, and her groom,\\ndarren stowell, 35, an executive with a nonprofit organization,\\nprovided their 140 guests at kruger\\'s with sunscreen packets and\\nbug spray cans in stainless steel buckets.\\n\\n\"anybody who would want to get married at a marriott was\\nworried,\" levy said. yet some guests can only take so much.\\n\\njonah silas, 30, a computer consultant, and yuri futamura, 29, a\\nmanager at a social-justice foundation, married last month in the\\nredwood grove at oz farm. they said in an interview that some of\\nthe guests passed on the offer to stay in the farm\\'s cabins and\\ninstead booked themselves at the local bed and breakfast.\\n\\nperhaps they reacted to the couple\\'s e-mail warnings, sent\\nbefore the wedding: \"some of you will have to take a mini-hike to\\nget to your cabins, even cross a river (over a footbridge)!\"\\n\\nor, \"electronics like laptops, stereos, cellphone/camera\\nchargers and hair dryers need to stay home.\"\\n\\nwhatever the hardship for guests, most couples find farm\\nnuptials worth the extra discomfort. levy was never too concerned\\nabout her wedding at kruger\\'s, even though she had attended another\\nfarm wedding where temperatures rose to 110 degrees and, she said,\\n\"people were melting.\"\\n\\nshe brimmed with her memories of vows said under an oak tree, a\\nreception on a grass field surrounded by a garden of dahlias and a\\nsunset that lit up the sky through late evening.\\n\\nasked if the mosquitoes ever showed up, she said: \"i\\'m sure. i\\nwas oblivious. it was my wedding day.\"\\n\\nkendall dye remembers precisely when he\\nfound the e-mail message that caused him to question his employer,\\natk thiokol, the aerospace and military contracting giant. he was\\nworking at home on a saturday morning in 2005, poring over dozens\\nof files.\\n\\nthe e-mail message showed that atk was warned years earlier that\\na military flare it produced might endanger american soldiers using\\nit.\\n\\n\"i thought, oh my god,\" dye recalls. \"i couldn\\'t believe that\\nwe knew.\"\\n\\nas far as he could tell, the company had ignored the warning.\\n\\nat the time, dye, an engineer at atk, was investigating the\\nsafety of flares that his company sold to the u.s. army and air\\nforce. what he found led him to file a lawsuit contending that atk\\ncheated taxpayers by selling fragile flares and, by doing so,\\nknowingly put soldiers at risk.\\n\\nthe flares aren\\'t the small, hand-held versions seen in war\\nmovies, but 3-foot-long, 36-pound aluminum tubes packed with\\npropellant that burn at more than 3,600 degrees fahrenheit, hot\\nenough to melt steel.\\n\\nwhen attached to parachutes, the tubes are released from the air\\nand burn for several minutes, bathing a square mile of battlefield\\nin bright or infrared light.\\n\\nthey are essential tools in the u.s. arsenal. early versions of\\nthe devices were used in vietnam, and they have been used on tens\\nof thousands of combat missions since then, according to atk.\\n\\nthey are so powerful that if one were to ignite accidentally --\\nwhich, according to dye, was possible -- it could set off nearby\\nordnance, burn a hole in the hull of a warship or melt through the\\nskin of an airplane high in the sky, according to his lawyers.\\n\\nat a time when the country is fighting two wars and has more\\nthan 180,000 troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan, dye\\'s\\ncontentions may raise anew questions about the reliability of\\nmilitary contractors and the safety of their products.\\n\\nlawyers for atk, which was acquired by alliant techsystems of\\neden prairie, minn., in 2001 and is now called atk launch systems,\\ncontend that the company did nothing wrong. they say that the\\nflares have injured no one -- an assertion no one has disproved. the\\natk flares have also been redesigned since dye first raised his\\nconcerns.\\n\\n\"atk is proud of the fact that we provide the nation\\'s armed\\nforces with systems that consistently perform exactly to design in\\nthe battlefield,\" the company says in a statement. although the\\njustice department has signed on as a plaintiff in dye\\'s lawsuit --\\nwhich seeks to recover tens of millions of dollars paid for\\nthousands upon thousands of flares -- atk says the lawsuit is\\nbaseless.\\n\\n\"atk has determined the allegations made by the department of\\njustice in the ongoing lawsuit to be wholly without merit,\" the\\ncompany says.\\n\\nbut dye has a different opinion. \"ethics and values got thrown\\nout the window when there was a lot of money at stake,\" he says.\\n\\nthe defense department pays more than $408 billion for goods and\\nservices. watchdog groups and some lawmakers have raised concerns\\nabout the government\\'s ability to monitor all that spending. a\\nreport to congress in march by the department\\'s own inspector\\ngeneral warned of an \"increasing gap between resources and\\noversight, which results in a corresponding increase in risk for\\nfraud, waste and abuse.\"\\n\\nshould the government win at trial in the lawsuit against atk,\\nit may be entitled to recover three times its damages; dye\\'s\\nlawyers estimate that the total could reach well into the hundreds\\nof millions of dollars.\\n\\nthat the government chose to join dye\\'s lawsuit -- the justice\\ndepartment is not obligated to take up whistle-blower claims --\\nsuggests that the case is a strong one, said danielle brian,\\nexecutive director of the project on government oversight, a\\nwashington watchdog group.\\n\\n\"it means that the government believes that the company knew\\nthat they were providing faulty products,\" brian said. \"this\\nisn\\'t a mistake. it\\'s willfully making money off endangering\\nsoldiers. i can\\'t imagine anything worse.\"\\n\\nfor decades, atk has sold versions of its flares not only to the\\nu.s. government, but also to the armed forces of other countries,\\nincluding canada, italy, colombia and spain. the devices cost at\\nleast $700 each, and contracts for bulk purchases totaled millions\\nof dollars.\\n\\nin the late 1990s, military buyers complained that too often,\\nthe flares failed to ignite. atk, which has a huge complex in the\\nopen spaces of northern utah, permitted a team of engineering\\nstudents at utah state university to design an improved igniter.\\n(the relationship developed after the university approached atk\\nseeking real-world projects for its students; the company, like\\nothers in the industry, often joined with universities to conduct\\nresearch.)\\n\\nbecause the ignition mechanism was a relatively simple,\\nmechanical device that used no proprietary technology, atk\\nofficials thought that the project offered a low-risk learning\\nexperience.\\n\\nthe students, under the supervision of their professors, came up\\nwith a system that used the force of a flare\\'s opening parachute to\\nsnap a polycarbonate plastic bar, about half an inch long and a\\ntenth of an inch thick. when the plastic broke, it activated a\\nseries of reactions that ignited the propellant. the students never\\ntested the new system to see whether the flares might ignite if\\nthey were dropped or accidentally jostled; they couldn\\'t conduct\\nsuch a test because they did not have access to complete, live\\nflares. specifications called for the flares to be able to\\nwithstand a fall of 10 feet without igniting.\\n\\natk didn\\'t perform those so-called drop tests, either. the\\ncompany contends that the flares had been used for a long time\\nwithout any problems, and so neither the company nor its customers\\nwere concerned about accidental ignition. the company began\\nshipping flares with the new igniter in 2000, according to\\ngovernment court filings.\\n\\nthe air force tested the flares for reliability at eglin air\\nforce base in florida in june 2000, launching them from warplanes.\\nthe flares ignited 97 percent of the time, exceeding the air\\nforce\\'s goal. but the air force did not perform tests to see\\nwhether the flares might accidentally ignite if dropped.\\n\\nciting pending litigation, an air force spokesman declined to\\ncomment.\\n\\nlawyers for atk contend that the armed forces waived tests that\\nwould have determined whether the flares could meet the 10-foot\\nstandard. they have further argued that without the results of\\nthose tests, the government could not claim that the flares were\\nflawed.\\n\\nthe first report of a potential problem surfaced in 2005, after\\nthe u.s. government and the armed forces of other countries had\\nbeen buying the redesigned flares for five years. the navy,\\nevaluating whether to buy the devices, simulated accidentally\\ndropping the flares, letting them fall from 40 feet. they ignited\\non hitting the ground. flares also ignited after falling 30 feet\\nand 20 feet, the navy found.\\n\\nyet it was still possible that the flares met the 10-foot\\nstandard even if they did not meet the navy\\'s more stringent\\n40-foot requirement. it was up to dye, who had recently been named\\nmanager of atk\\'s flare program in utah, to figure out what was\\ngoing on.\\n\\ndye, 54, a tall man with gray hair and a neatly trimmed\\nmustache, was a 21-year veteran at atk. he joined one of the\\ncompany\\'s predecessors after finishing college and after a\\nthree-year stint in the army as a mechanic. fixing things suited\\nhis temperament: methodical, logical, exacting.\\n\\nfirst, he said, he asked an engineer to analyze how much of a\\nfall that critical piece of plastic in the igniter could survive.\\ndye thought that perhaps the plastic could be strengthened to meet\\nthe navy\\'s requirement. instead, he was stunned by the answer he\\nsays he got from the engineer: it could snap after a fall of 11\\ninches -- not 11 feet, but 11 inches.\\n\\ndye decided to test the flares directly; the company says he\\nnever sought approval to conduct the tests and didn\\'t document the\\nresults properly.\\n\\naccording to court documents, on nov. 9, 2005, he and several\\ncolleagues took five flares to a testing site in atk\\'s complex.\\n\\nthey dropped a flare from 10 feet. it ignited.\\n\\nthey dropped a flare from five feet. it ignited, too.\\n\\nby the end of the day, dye and a safety engineer had warned\\nemployees to keep clear of the flares. production stopped.\\n\\nthat afternoon, the company convened a \"war room\" of about a\\ndozen experts to investigate the flares, dye said, and he was part\\nof the team. no formal notice was given to buyers of the flares;\\natk asserts that a company official informally advised an air force\\nrepresentative.\\n\\nno one, dye said, wanted him to perform any more tests. in his\\nview, there were simple questions that atk had to answer to\\nidentify the extent of the problem. for starters, if the company\\'s\\ncontracts for years had required flares to survive a 10-foot drop\\ntest, he said, \"did we do the test or did we not do the test?\"\\n\\nno one, he said, seemed to know. two days after his drop tests,\\ndye asked a secretary for the keys to the office where copies of\\ncontracts were kept. he took the files covering the period shortly\\nbefore and after the introduction of the new igniter and brought\\nthem to the windowless conference room where the team was working.\\n\\ndye says he remembered saying, \"we need to get to the bottom of\\nwhat happened.\"\\n\\nat the end of the day, he carried the files to his pickup for\\nthe 45-minute drive from the desert to his house, and, that night,\\nhe started reading.\\n\\ndye and his wife of 24 years, elizabeth, live here in north\\nogden, about 50 miles north of salt lake city.\\n\\nthe house is remarkably neat, orderly and full of evidence of\\ndye\\'s disciplined, project-oriented approach to life. he built\\nwood-edged glass boxes for three dolls on a shelf above one\\ndoorway. behind the house sits the hot tub that he installed. in\\nthe garage, he keeps the power drill, saw and other tools that he\\nuses for those projects.\\n\\nand on that saturday in 2005, his project was reviewing the\\nfiles related to the flare program.\\n\\namong the documents was a printout of an e-mail message sent in\\n2000 by ray w. beus, then the atk test engineer assigned to\\nevaluate and report to his supervisors about an aspect of the\\nstudent-designed igniter. in the message, beus warned about a\\n\"more realistic scenario, which might present a significant hazard\\nto equipment/personnel: if the flare assembly receives a\\nsignificant impact (i.e., dropped) i can foresee\" the plastic\\nrestraint in the igniter breaking, he wrote, \"resulting in\\ncomplete ignition of the flare.\"\\n\\nbeus recommended performing drop tests to gauge the safety of\\nthe flares with the new igniter. then he added, \"you can relax,\\nrest assured i did not include this comment/recommendation in the\\nmemo although i would like to have.\"\\n\\nbut according to the government, no drop tests had been\\nperformed and the company had not passed along beus\\' concerns or\\nrecommendation to the air force. (in 2003, the company conducted an\\n\"abbreviated\" test of a single flare, according to the\\ngovernment, but the test controlled the angle at which the flare\\nhit the ground.)\\n\\nbeus still works at atk, according to the company. atk declined\\nto make him available for an interview, citing the pending\\nlitigation, and beus did not return phone calls.\\n\\nafter finding the e-mail message, dye said he called his\\nsupervisor, robert winter, the director of flare and decoy\\nprograms. \"he listened to me read it,\" dye said, referring to the\\nmessage. \"there was like a pause, and he said, \\'keep that close to\\nyour chest.\\' i knew what he meant: don\\'t tell anybody.\"\\n\\natk has strongly denied that anyone at the company told dye to\\nkeep quiet. the company, again citing the pending litigation, did\\nnot make winter available for an interview, and he did not return\\ncalls to his office.\\n\\nover that weekend, dye said, he continued reviewing files but\\nfound nothing as significant as the beus e-mail message. unable to\\nsleep, dye rose well before dawn on monday, loaded the box of files\\ninto his truck and headed back to atk\\'s complex.\\n\\nat the office, he assembled copies of documents to distribute to\\neveryone in the war room. dye said he did not share beus\\' email\\nmessage because winter had told him not to.\\n\\nthe atk team was not focused on determining just how fragile the\\nflares were, dye said. instead, he said, his colleagues looked to\\nsee whether a third-party supplier might have modified the flares\\nand thus introduced a defect.\\n\\n\"they went to the end of that road,\" dye said, \"and the buck\\ncould not be passed.\" atk denies that the company tried to avoid\\nresponsibility.\\n\\na week after dye first conducted the drop tests, atk sent a\\nletter to customers, advising them that the flares \"may be more\\nsensitive\" than specifications allowed, if dropped.\\n\\ndye was furious. \"i objected to that letter,\" he said. \"it\\nhad no mention of an 11-inch possibility.\"\\n\\na few weeks later, the army and the air force notified atk that\\nthey would not accept 6,085 flares that had been manufactured and\\nawaited delivery. (the company says it retrofitted the flares on\\nits own dime, modifying the igniter, and delivered them. atk says\\nthe modified flares met the 10-foot requirement.)\\n\\nin the weeks after he found the beus memo, dye said, he grew\\nincreasingly concerned that the company was not going to fix flares\\nequipped with the igniter he had tested. he decided to find a way\\nto tell the government what he had found, and, on the web, he\\nlearned of the false claims act.\\n\\nthat federal law permits private individuals to sue on behalf of\\nthe united states if they believe that they have inside knowledge\\nof fraud against the government. at first, the lawsuits are kept\\nsecret, under court seal, while investigators look into the\\naccusations and decide whether to join the case. if the government\\nintervenes and recovers money, the whistle-blower can receive up to\\n30 percent of the amount.\\n\\ndye also found the web site for phillips &amp;amp; cohen, a law firm\\nspecializing in whistle-blower cases. he filled out an online\\napplication and asked for representation.\\n\\n\"i felt like the only avenue i had was to go outside,\" dye\\nsays. he said that he was not motivated by money, and when asked\\nwhat he would do if he received millions from the lawsuit, he\\npaused for a moment and then said he would like a snowmobile.\\n\\neric r. havian, a lawyer at the firm who is representing dye,\\nsaid he could not recall another case involving such large dollar\\namounts that had evidence like the beus e-mail message. \"you don\\'t\\nsee those kinds of documents very often,\" he says.\\n\\nthe law firm filed a complaint under seal in april 2006. within\\na month, despite havian\\'s warnings that no lawsuit was a sure\\nthing, dye notified atk that he intended to quit.\\n\\n\"i just couldn\\'t go out and play the game of looking my bosses\\nin the eye,\" dye said, even though no one at the company then knew\\nthat he was working with the government.\\n\\nthe justice department investigated dye\\'s case and decided to\\njoin it just over a year later. justice department lawyers declined\\nto comment on the atk case.\\n\\nbut the agency\\'s subsequent examinations of atk\\'s flare program\\nturned up more unsettling information, according to court\\ndocuments.\\n\\nfor example, the government contends that when atk began\\nshipping flares with the new igniter in 2000, the company did not\\nadvise one customer, the canadian government, of the change. (atk\\nsays the canadian government was notified.)\\n\\nthe government also contends that when the canadian government\\nasked about the igniter, an atk official responded that the igniter\\nwas the standard in the united states and had been tested by the\\nair force. but the air force tests at the eglin base had not yet\\ntaken place at the time the flares were delivered and in any event\\ndid not include a 10-foot drop test, the lawyers wrote.\\n\\nin negotiations with the u.s. army over additional flare\\npurchases, the company cited the sale to canada \"as evidence of\\nthe flare design suitability,\" justice department lawyers wrote.\\nin this way, the lawyers contended, atk misled the army into\\nwaiving testing requirements. atk responded that there was no\\ndeception.\\n\\natk appears ready to wage war in court and has challenged each\\nclaim made by the government.\\n\\nthe company has asserted that because the government waived the\\ndrop test, it could not claim that the flares would have failed.\\nand in court arguments in may, an atk lawyer dismissed the\\nsignificance of the beus e-mail message.\\n\\n\"it doesn\\'t say that the flares fail to meet a performance spec\\nor any other contract requirement or even that he thinks they do,\"\\nsaid edward j. shapiro, a partner at latham &amp;amp; watkins, which\\nrepresents atk. \"he doesn\\'t say there is a contractually required\\ntest that wasn\\'t performed. he doesn\\'t say there is a contractually\\nrequired test or, for that matter, any other test that was\\nperformed improperly.\"\\n\\nit is not clear how many of the thousands of flares at issue in\\nthe lawsuit are still in use around the world; the u.s. army\\nstopped using them, according to justice department lawyers, and\\nthe air force restricted them to \"emergency combat use.\" lawyers\\nfor dye say the government has mothballed at least 40,000 flares.\\n\\nso far, atk has retrofitted igniters in 14 flares that were sold\\nto chile and about 5,000 sold to canada, according to a spokesman.\\nand the company has offered to retrofit at cost the igniters in\\ntens of thousands of flares sold to the u.s. government. the trial\\nis set to begin in 2010.\\n\\nlike his uncle, his grandfather and many of their\\nneighbors, arie versendaal spent decades working at the maytag\\nfactory here, turning coils of steel into washing machines.\\n\\nwhen the plant closed last year, taking 1,800 jobs out of this\\ntown of 16,000 people, it seemed a familiar story of american\\nindustrial decline: another company town brought to its knees by\\nthe vagaries of global trade.\\n\\nexcept that versendaal has a new factory job, at a plant here\\nthat makes blades for turbines that turn wind into electricity.\\nacross the road, in the old maytag factory, another company is\\nbuilding concrete towers to support the massive turbines. together,\\nthe two plants are expected to employ nearly 700 people by early\\nnext year.\\n\\n\"life\\'s not over,\" versendaal says. \"for 35 years, i pounded\\nmy body to the ground. now, i feel like i\\'m doing something\\nbeneficial for mankind and the united states. we\\'ve got to get used\\nto depending on ourselves instead of something else, and wind is\\nfree. the wind is blowing out there for anybody to use.\"\\n\\nfrom the faded steel enclaves of pennsylvania to the reeling\\nauto towns of michigan and ohio, state and local governments are\\naggressively courting manufacturing companies that supply wind\\nenergy farms, solar electricity plants and factories that turn\\ncrops into diesel fuel.\\n\\nthis courtship has less to do with the loftiest aims of\\nrenewable energy proponents -- curbing greenhouse gas emissions and\\nlessening american dependence on foreign oil -- and more to do with\\npaychecks. in the face of rising unemployment, renewable energy has\\nbecome a crucial source of good jobs, particularly for laid-off\\nrust belt workers.\\n\\namid a presidential election campaign now dominated by economic\\nconcerns, wind turbines and solar panels seem as ubiquitous in\\ncampaign advertisements as the american flag.\\n\\nno one believes that renewable energy can fully replace what has\\nbeen lost on the american factory floor, where people with no\\ncollege education have traditionally been able to finance\\nmiddle-class lives. many at maytag earned $20 an hour in addition\\nto health benefits. versendaal now earns about $13 an hour.\\n\\nstill, it\\'s a beginning in a sector of the economy that has been\\nmarked by wrenching endings, potentially a second chance for\\nfactory workers accustomed to layoffs and diminished aspirations.\\n\\nin west branch, iowa, a town of 2,000 people east of iowa city,\\nworkers now assemble wind turbines in a former pump factory. in\\nnorthwestern ohio, glass factories suffering because of the\\ndownturn in the auto industry are retooling to make solar energy\\npanels.\\n\\n\"the green we\\'re interested in is cash,\" says norman w.\\njohnston, who started a solar cell factory called solar fields in\\ntoledo in 2003.\\n\\nthe market is potentially enormous. in a report last year, the\\nenergy department concluded that the united states could make wind\\nenergy the source of one-fifth of its electricity by 2030, up from\\nabout 2 percent today. that would require nearly $500 billion in\\nnew construction and add more than 3 million jobs, the report said.\\nmuch of the growth would be around the great lakes, the hardest-hit\\nregion in a country that has lost 4 million manufacturing jobs over\\nthe last decade.\\n\\nthrow in solar energy along with generating power from crops,\\nand the continued embrace of renewable energy would create as many\\nas 5 million jobs by 2030, asserts daniel m. kammen, director of\\nthe renewable and appropriate energy laboratory at the university\\nof california, berkeley, and an adviser to the presidential\\ncampaign of sen. barack obama.\\n\\nthe unfolding financial crisis seems likely to slow the pace of\\ndevelopment, making investment harder to secure. but renewable\\nenergy has already gathered what analysts say is unstoppable\\nmomentum. in texas, the oil baron t. boone pickens is developing\\nwhat would be the largest wind farm in the world. most states now\\nrequire that a significant percentage of electricity be generated\\nfrom wind, solar and biofuels, effectively giving the market a\\ngovernment mandate.\\n\\nand many analysts expect the united states to eventually embrace\\nsome form of new regulatory system aimed at curbing global warming\\nthat would force coal-fired electricity plants to pay for the\\npollution they emit. that could make wind, solar and other\\nalternative fuels competitive in terms of the cost of producing\\nelectricity.\\n\\nboth presidential candidates have made expanding renewable\\nenergy a policy priority. obama, the democratic nominee, has\\noutlined plans to spend $150 billion over the next decade to spur\\nprivate companies to invest. sen. john mccain, the republican\\nnominee, has spoken more generally of the need for investment.\\n\\nin june, more than 12,000 people and 770 exhibitors jammed a\\nconvention center in houston for the annual american wind energy\\nassociation trade show. \"five years ago, we were all walking\\naround in birkenstocks,\" says john m. brown, managing director of\\na turbine manufacturer, entegrity wind systems of boulder, colo.,\\nwhich had a booth on the show floor. \"now it\\'s all suits. you go\\nto a seminar, and it\\'s getting taught by lawyers and bankers.\"\\n\\nso it goes in iowa. perched on the edge of the great plains --\\nthe so-called saudi arabia of wind -- the state has rapidly become a\\nleading manufacturing center for wind power equipment.\\n\\n\"we are blessed with certainly some of the best wind in the\\nworld,\" says chet culver, iowa\\'s governor.\\n\\nmaytag was born in newton more than a century ago. even after\\nthe company swelled into a global enterprise, its headquarters\\nremained here, in the center of the state, 35 miles east of des\\nmoines.\\n\\n\"newton was an island,\" says ted johnson, the president of\\nlocal chapter of the united automobile workers, which represented\\nthe maytaggers. \"we saw autos go through hard times, other\\nindustries. but we still had meat on our barbecues.\"\\n\\nthe end began in the summer of 2005. whirlpool, the appliance\\nconglomerate, swallowed up maytag. as the word spread that local\\njobs were doomed -- whirlpool was consolidating three factories\\'\\nproduction into two -- workers unloaded their memorabilia at pappy\\'s\\nantique mall downtown: coffee mugs, buttons, award plaques.\\n\\n\"if it said maytag on it, we bought it,\" says susie jones, the\\nstore manager. \"at first, i thought the stuff had value. then, it\\nwas out of the kindness of my heart. and now i don\\'t have any heart\\nleft. it don\\'t sell. people are mad at them. they ripped out our\\nsoul.\"\\n\\nwhen the town needed a library, a park or a community college,\\nmaytag lent a hand. the company was newton\\'s largest employer, its\\nwages paying for tidy houses, new cars, weddings, retirement\\nparties and funerals.\\n\\nas whirlpool made plans to shutter the factory, state and county\\neconomic development officials scrambled to attract new employers.\\nin june 2007, the local government dispatched a team to the\\namerican wind energy association show in los angeles. weeks later,\\na company called tpi composites arrived in newton to have a look.\\n\\nbased in arizona, tpi makes wind turbine blades by layering\\nstrips of fiberglass into large molds, requiring a long work space.\\nthe maytag plant was too short. so local officials showed tpi an\\nundeveloped piece of land encircled by cornfields on the edge of\\ntown where a new plant could be built.\\n\\nalthough tpi was considering a site in mexico with low labor\\ncosts, newton had a better location. rail lines and interstate 80\\nconnect it to the great plains, where the turbines are needed.\\nformer maytag employees were eager for work, and the community\\ncollege was ready to teach them blade-making.\\n\\nnewton won. in exchange for $6 million in tax sweeteners, tpi\\npromised to hire 500 people by 2010. it has already hired about 225\\nand is on track to have a work force of 290 by mid-november.\\n\\n\"getting 500 jobs in one swoop is like winning the lottery,\"\\nsays newton\\'s mayor, chaz allen. \"we don\\'t have to just roll over\\nand die.\"\\n\\non a recent afternoon, workers inside the cavernous tpi plant\\ngaze excitedly at a crane lifting a blade from its mold and\\ncarrying it toward a cleared area. curved and smooth, the blade\\nstretches as long as a wing of the largest jets. one worker hums\\nthe theme from \"jaws\" as the blade slips past.\\n\\nlarry crady, a worker, takes particular pleasure in seeing the\\nfinished product overhead, a broad grin forming across his goateed\\nface. he used to run a team that made coin-operated laundry\\nmachines at maytag. now he supervises a team that lays down\\nfiberglass strips between turbine moldings. he runs his hand across\\nthe surface of the next blade for signs of unevenness.\\n\\n\"i like this job more than i did maytag,\" crady says. \"i feel\\ni\\'m doing something to improve our country, rather than just\\nbuilding a washing machine.\"\\n\\nask him how long he spent at maytag and crady responds\\nprecisely: \"23.6 years.\" which is to say, 6.4 years short of\\ndrawing a pension whose famously generous terms compelled so many\\nto work at the maytag plant. \"that\\'s what everyone in newton was\\nwaiting on,\" he says. \"you could get that 30 and out.\"\\n\\nbut he is now optimistic about the decades ahead. \"i feel\\nsolid,\" he says. \"this is going to be the future. this company is\\ngoing to grow huge.\"\\n\\nthe human resources office at tpi is overseen by terri rock, who\\nused to have the same position at maytag\\'s corporate headquarters,\\nwhere she worked for two decades. in her last years there, her job\\nwas mostly spent ending other people\\'s jobs.\\n\\n\"there was a lot of heartache,\" she says. \"this is a small\\ntown, and you\\'d have to let people go and then see them at the\\ngrocery store with their families. it was a real tough job at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nnow, rock starts fresh careers, hiring as many as 20 people a\\nweek. she enjoys the creative spirit of a start-up. \"we\\'re not\\nstuck with the mentality of \\'this is how we\\'ve done it for the last\\n35 years,\"\\' she says.\\n\\nmaytag is gone in large part because of the calculus driving\\nglobalization: household appliances and so many other goods are now\\nproduced mostly where physical labor is cheaper, in countries like\\nchina and mexico. but wind turbines and blades are huge and heavy.\\nthe tpi plant is in iowa largely because of the costs of shipping\\nsuch huge items from far away.\\n\\n\"these are american jobs that are hard to export,\" says crugar\\ntuttle, general manager of the tpi plant.\\n\\nand these jobs are part of a build-out that is gathering force.\\nmore than $5 billion in venture capital poured into so-called clean\\nenergy technology industries last year in north america and europe,\\naccording to cleantech, a trade group. in north america, that\\nrepresented nearly a fifth of all venture capital, up from less\\nthan 2 percent in 2000.\\n\\n\"everybody involved in the wind industry is in a massive hurry\\nto build out capacity,\" tuttle says. \"it will feed into a whole\\nlocal industry of people making stuff, driving trucks.\\nmanufacturing has been in decline for decades. this is our greatest\\nchance to turn it around. it\\'s the biggest ray of hope that we\\'ve\\ngot.\"\\n\\nthose rays aren\\'t touching everyone, though. hundreds of former\\nmaytag workers remain without jobs, or stuck in positions paying\\nless than half their previous wages. outside an old union hall,\\nsome former maytaggers share cigarettes and commiserate about the\\nstrains of starting over.\\n\\njohnson, the former local president, is jobless. at 45, he has\\nslipped back into a world of financial hardship that he thought he\\nhad escaped. his father was a self-employed welder. his mother\\nworked at an overalls factory.\\n\\n\"i grew up in southern iowa with nothing,\" he says. \"if\\nsomebody got a new car, everybody heard about it.\"\\n\\nwhen maytag shut down, his $1,100-a-week paycheck became a $360\\nunemployment check. he and his wife divorced, turning what once was\\na two-income household into a no-income household. he sold off his\\ntruck, his dining room furniture, his maytag refrigerator -- all in\\nan effort to pay his mortgage. last winter, he surrendered his\\nhouse to foreclosure.\\n\\njohnson has applied for more than 220 jobs, he says, from sales\\npositions at lowe\\'s to tpi. he has yet to secure an interview. his\\nunemployment benefits ran out in may. he no longer has health\\ninsurance. he recently broke a tooth where a filling had been, but\\nhe can\\'t afford to have it fixed.\\n\\nwhen his teenage daughter, who lives with him, complained of\\nheadaches, he paid $1,500 out of pocket for an mri. the doctor\\nfound a cyst on her brain. and how is she doing now? johnson\\nfreezes at the question. he is a grown man with silver hair, a\\nblack harley-davidson t-shirt across a barrel chest, and calloused\\nhands that could once bring a comfortable living. he tries to\\ncompose himself, but tears burst. \"i\\'m sorry,\" he says.\\n\\nhe signed up for a state insurance program for low-income\\nfamilies so his daughter could go to a neurologist.\\n\\nalthough the united states is well behind europe in\\nmanufacturing wind-power gear and solar panels, other american\\ncommunities are joining newton\\'s push, laying the groundwork for\\nlarge-scale production.\\n\\n\"you have to reinvest in industrial capacity,\" says randy\\nudall, an energy consultant in carbondale, colo. \"you use wind to\\nrevitalize the rust belt. you make steel again. you bring it home.\\nwe ought to be planting wind turbines as if they were trees.\"\\n\\nin west branch, acciona, a spanish company, has converted the\\nempty hydraulic pump factory into a plant that makes wind turbines.\\nwhen the previous plant closed, it wiped out 130 jobs; acciona has\\nhired 120 people, many of them workers from the old factory.\\n\\nsteve jennings, 50, once made $14 an hour at the hydraulic pump\\nfactory. when he heard that a wind turbine plant was coming in a\\nmere five miles from his house, he was among the first to apply for\\na job. now he\\'s a team leader, earning nearly $20 an hour -- more\\nthan he\\'s ever made. ordinary line workers make $16 an hour and up.\\n\\n\"it seemed like manufacturing was going away,\" he says. \"but\\ni think this is here to stay.\"\\n\\nacciona built its first turbine in iowa last december and is on\\ntrack to make 200 this year. next year, it plans to double\\nproduction.\\n\\nfor now, acciona is importing most of its metal parts from\\neurope. but the company is seeking american suppliers, which could\\nhelp catalyze increased metalwork in the united states.\\n\\n\"michigan, ohio -- that\\'s the rust belt,\" says adrian latrace,\\nthe plant\\'s general manager. \"we could be purchasing these\\ncomponents from those states. we\\'ve got the attention of the folks\\nin the auto industry. this thing has critical mass.\"\\n\\nin toledo, the declining auto industry has prompted a retooling.\\nfor more than a century, the city has been dominated by\\nglass-making, but the problems of detroit automakers have softened\\ndemand for car windows from its plants. toledo has lost nearly a\\nthird of its manufacturing jobs since 2000.\\n\\nnow, toledo is harnessing its glass-making skills to carve out a\\nniche in solar power. at the center of the trend is a huge glass\\nmaker, pilkington, which bought a toledo company that was born in\\nthe 19th century.\\n\\nhalf of pilkington\\'s business is in the automotive industry. in\\nthe last two years, that business is down 30 percent in north\\namerica. but the solar division, started two years ago, is growing\\nat a 40 percent clip annually.\\n\\nnearby, the university of toledo aims to play the same enabling\\nrole in solar power that stanford played at the dawn of the\\ninternet. it has 15 faculty members researching solar power. by\\nlicensing the technologies spawned in its labs, the university\\nencourages its academics to start businesses.\\n\\none company started by a professor, xunlight, is developing thin\\nand flexible solar cells. it has 65 employees and expects to have\\nas many as 150 by the middle of next year.\\n\\n\"it\\'s a second opportunity,\" says an assembly supervisor, matt\\nmcgilvery, one of xunlight\\'s early hires. mcgilvery, 50, spent a\\ndecade making steel coils for $23 an hour before he was laid off.\\nxunlight hired him this year. his paycheck has shrunk, he says,\\ndeclining to get into particulars, but his old-fashioned skills\\ndrawing plans by hand are again in demand as xunlight designs its\\nmanufacturing equipment from scratch, and the future seems\\npromising.\\n\\n\"the hope is that two years from now everything is smoking and\\nthat envelope will slide across the table,\" he says. \"the money\\nthat people are dumping into this tells me it\\'s a huge market.\"\\n\\nin newton, the tidy downtown clustered around a domed courthouse\\nis already showing signs of new life, after the pain of maytag\\'s\\ndemise.\\n\\nthe owner of courtyard floral, diane farver, says she saw a\\nsteep drop in sales after maytag left, particularly around holidays\\nlike valentine\\'s day and mother\\'s day, when she used to run several\\nvanloads a week to the washing machine plant. times have changed\\nsince that decline. when tpi recently dispatched workers to a\\nfactory in china for training, the company ordered bouquets for the\\nspouses left at home.\\n\\nacross the street at network realty, the broker dennis combs\\nsays the housing market is starting to stabilize as maytag jobs are\\nreplaced.\\n\\n\"we\\'ve gone from maytag, which wasn\\'t upgrading their\\nantiquated plant, to something that\\'s cutting-edge technology,\\nsomething that every politician is screaming this country has to\\nhave,\" he says.\\n\\nat uncle nancy\\'s coffee house, talk of unemployment checks and\\nforeclosures now mixes with job leads and looming investment.\\n\\n\"we\\'re seeing hope,\" says allen, the mayor.\\n\\nthe town is hardly done. kimberly m. didier, head of the newton\\ndevelopment corp., which helped recruit tpi, is trying to attract\\nturbine manufacturers and providers of raw materials and parts for\\nthe wind industry.\\n\\n\"this is in its infancy,\" she says. \"automobiles,\\nwasher-dryers and other appliances have

matt carle\\'s first goal of the season.\\n\\nvinny lecavalier tied the score 1-1 with 5:51 left in the second\\nperiod with his sixth goal on a blast from the top of the faceoff\\ncircle. but the senators scored 39 seconds later when dany heatley\\nscored after being left alone in front of the net.\\n\\ngoalie mike smith, who took a painful shot off the thumb and\\nforefinger of his right hand during the morning skate, made 29\\nsaves and was not at fault on either goal and stopped two\\nbreakaways.\\n\\nsenators goalie alex auld also was solid but couldn\\'t stop\\nartyukhin, jussi jokinen or marty st. louis in the shootout.\\n\\nboth teams had seven first-period shots. the senators had the\\nbetter early chances and missed a huge opportunity 15 seconds into\\nthe game when daniel alfredsson had smith down but backhanded the\\npuck wide.\\n\\nsmith was down and the net was open again at 6:34, when mcammond\\nhad the puck alone in front. mcammond hunted for the best angle by\\nskating cross-crease. but smith somehow got a glove up to make the\\nsave.\\n\\nthe lightning did not get its first shot until 9:58, when auld\\nstopped vinny prospal\\'s turnaround wrist shot from the bottom of a\\nfaceoff circle.\\n\\nthat seemed to turn the tide, and tampa bay had the territorial\\nadvantage in the second half of the period as it outshot ottawa\\n7-3, including chris gratton\\'s big slap shot that auld stopped with\\nhis left leg.\\n\\nthe senators entered the game with the league\\'s third-best power\\nplay at 24.5 percent.\\n\\nit cashed in 8:06 into the second period as antoine vermette\\'s\\ngoal gave ottawa a power-play tally in 10 of 11 games. vermette was\\nable to sneak behind defenseman paul ranger and convert a rebound\\nafter smith stopped christoph schubert\\'s blast from the point.\\n\\nthe lightning evened the score with 5:51 remaining on\\nlecavalier\\'s goal, a slap shot that beat auld on the short side. it\\nwas not officially a power-play goal, coming exactly two minutes\\nafter chris neil was called for interference, but neil had not left\\nthe box.\\n\\nthe good feelings were short-lived as heatley, who somehow shook\\nranger, scored off a pass from defenseman filip kuba.\\n\\ntampa bay missed a big chance early in the third period but\\ncould not score on a 1:48 five-on-three on which it used five\\nforwards, passed beautifully and got only one shot on goal.\\n\\ndamian cristodero can be reached at cristoderosptimes.com.\\n\\n&amp;lt;table width\"126\" border\"1\"

workouts with\\ntrainer mickey marotti included some georgia stats: 188  the number\\nof rushing yards bulldogs rb knownshon moreno gained against the\\ngators last season.\\n\\nthey came in evenly divided reps on weights, pushups, crunches\\nand sit-ups.\\n\\n\"it was all the numbers from the stuff we got embarrassed by,\"\\nuf quarterback tim tebow said. \"we worked on that. and i think\\nit\\'s been a lot on our minds all year.\"\\n\\nthe memory motivated the gators, they now admit.\\n\\n\"was it motivation for the summer? yeah, it was,\" meyer said.\\n\"it was. it was the only rival we lost to a year ago and losing\\ndoesn\\'t set well with our team. and that\\'s a good thing.\"\\n\\ntimeout?: if you\\'re wondering why florida called two timeouts in\\nthe final 44 seconds  with a 49-10 lead  it all depends on whom you\\nasked.\\n\\nmeyer said he was trying to get more work for rb emmanuel moody,\\nwho just returned from an ankle injury.\\n\\n\"i thought he deserved that chance,\" meyer said. \"we were\\njust trying to win a game.\"\\n\\nbut tebow and junior wr percy harvin seemed to think it was an\\nopportunity to allow the players and florida fans a few more\\nmoments to savor the victory.\\n\\n\"we looked at the sideline and saw that all their (georgia)\\nfans had gone and we saw our fans still there,\" said harvin, who\\nscored a touchdown in his 10th straight game. \"we just wanted to\\nrub it in a little bit. not too much, but it was great for us.\"\\n\\nmurphy\\'s reward: st. petersburg native louis murphy got the\\nopportunity to walk off the field as a winner in his last game\\nagainst georgia.\\n\\nmurphy, a wide receiver, had one of the game\\'s biggest plays, a\\n44-yard touchdown reception from tebow.\\n\\n\"we were ready more than ever,\" said murphy, a former lakewood\\nhigh standout. \"we came out and hit on all cylinders and we played\\na great game. i didn\\'t see this (lopsided score), but i knew we had\\nthe potential.\"\\n\\nharvin said he was especially happy for murphy because of all he\\nhas been through in the past year. his mother, filomena, died in\\nfebruary.\\n\\n\"this was the game that she started to get sick (last season),\\nand i think it meant more to him,\" harvin said. \"it meant a lot\\nto all of us, our staff, but i know it meant a lot to him.\"\\n\\ntebow slightly injured: tebow stood at a podium about 30 minutes\\nafter the gators\\' victory wearing a protective boot on his left\\nfoot.\\n\\ntebow said he sprained his left ankle on the play just before\\nhis touchdown pass to murphy with 5:33 remaining in the third\\nquarter.\\n\\nthe ankle didn\\'t stop tebow from doing a victory lap around\\njacksonville municipal stadium to slap hands with florida fans  and\\nhe said it won\\'t stop him from playing in next week\\'s vanderbilt\\ngame.\\n\\n\"i just sprained it a little bit, but it\\'s fine,\" tebow said.\\n\"this (boot) is just to keep pressure off of it.\"\\n\\njacksonville  when it was all over, when the final seconds had\\nticked off the clock and no. 5 florida was celebrating its 49-10\\nvictory over no. 8 georgia, the truth finally came through.\\n\\nyes, the gators were bothered all year long, nearly every day,\\nabout their bitter loss to georgia last season. and no, it wasn\\'t\\njust about georgia\\'s infamous end zone celebration. it was just as\\nmuch about how poorly its defense had played. how badly florida\\nlooked overall against the bulldogs.\\n\\nso all week long, florida\\'s sole mission was to play the best\\ndefense it had all season. more important, to stop georgia star\\nrunning back knowshon moreno and not allow the bulldogs to run all\\nover the gators as they had last season.\\n\\nthey executed that plan to perfection.\\n\\nholding its archrival without a touchdown until the final 3:09,\\nflorida redeemed itself in front of 84,649 at jacksonville\\nmunicipal stadium. the 39-point margin of victory was the\\nsecond-largest for florida in the 86-year series.\\n\\nwith a victory over vanderbilt next week, florida can clinch the\\nsec east title.\\n\\n\"(defensive coordinator) charlie strong and his staff did a\\ngreat job,\" uf coach urban meyer said. \"as of tuesday night, they\\nwere still preparing and adjusting their game plan. i thought he\\ncalled a brilliant game and the players executed well. with great\\ndefense, you can win a bunch of ballgames and i thought we played\\ngreat defense tonight.\"\\n\\nflorida (7-1, 5-1 sec) gave up 398 total yards, but held georgia\\n(7-2, 4-2) to 106 rushing yards. moreno, the sec\\'s second-leading\\nrusher, was held to 65 yards on 17 carries.\\n\\n\"the key was to stop the run,\" strong said. \"we knew that\\n(georgia quarterback matthew) stafford could throw the ball and\\nthey have very good receivers, but our whole key was to stop the\\nrun. the way moreno ran against us last year, we could not let that\\nhappen. \"\\n\\nthe gators intercepted stafford (18-of-33 for 265 yards) three\\ntimes  including an 88-yard return by joe haden and a 64-yarder by\\nahmad black. both led to florida touchdowns. dustin doe also had an\\ninterception and terron sanders\\' 20-yard return after recovering a\\nfumble also led to a florida touchdown.\\n\\n\"there\\'s nothing soft about our defense,\" sanders said. \"it\\'s\\na complete turnaround from last season. \"\\n\\nwhile the defense set things up, the offense delivered.\\n\\nflorida quarterback tim tebow was 10-of-13 for 154 yards and two\\ntouchdowns  a 44-yard pass to senior louis murphy and a 25-yarder\\nto junior percy harvin.\\n\\n\"this was a game we felt would make our season and we got it,\"\\nsaid harvin, who had three receptions for 52 yards and four carries\\nfor 37 yards.\\n\\ntebow also rushed for three touchdowns, registering 193 total\\noffensive yards.\\n\\n\"we were very emotional, but we were a lot more than emotional\\nbecause emotion just lasts for 10 or 15 minutes. we were playing\\nwith passion, too. we were very passionate and that lasts a lot\\nmore than emotion does.\"\\n\\nthe gators piled up 373 yards against a defense that entered the\\ngame ranked 21st in the nation, and had held opponents to an\\naverage of 20.3 points a game.\\n\\n\" florida did a good job today, no doubt,\" georgia coach mark\\nricht said. \" we can\\'t let this loss hurt us the next time we\\nplay. the bottom line is we played and got whipped. \"\\n\\nwith so much riding on this game, and the memories of last\\nseason, meyer admitted the victory meant a great deal to him and\\nthe gators.\\n\\n\"what does it mean?\" he asked. \"it means we\\'re first place in\\nthe sec east all by ourselves. it\\'s a rivalry game and we\\'ve done\\nfairly well against our rivals. it means a lot because it\\'s a top\\n10 team. this is a game we had to have.\"\\n\\nantonya english can be reached at englishsptimes.com.\\n\\neven through the tough years, joe maddon seemed to find a way to\\nput a positive spin on things. so it was no surprise that he didn\\'t\\nlet any disappointment over a four-games-to-one loss to the\\nphillies in the fall classic stop him from reflecting on the rays\\'\\nworst-to-the-world series ride. nor did it dampen his excitement\\nover the club\\'s future in an end-of-the-season interview unlike any\\nhe has had as rays manager.\\n\\nfavorite moment\\n\\nfrom the season?\\n\\nthe whole thing.  my favorite moment is to see the faces,\\nwhether it\\'s our players, the guys who work in our clubhouse, the\\ntraining staff, the guys upstairs, the front office people who have\\nbeen here for so many years. to see the look on their faces right\\nnow, and how happy they are. the fact that all the negativity has\\nbeen laid to rest, we have a bright future ahead of us. i\\'ve been\\nlooking at faces a lot.\\n\\nfor example, the other day we ended up in wilmington, del., in\\nthe middle of the night after a tie ballgame. it was freezing\\noutside. and we\\'re all outside getting our luggage, at whatever\\ntime it was, and a significant part of the organization was there.\\nto me, that was a great moment. that might be the one snapshot i\\'ll\\ntake with me.\\n\\nthings that will be taken\\n\\nfrom the world series into next season?\\n\\nthe biggest part is the little things. you can break down those\\ngames as an example  (jayson) werth\\'s two-strike hitting, again,\\nsame with (carlos) ruiz and (pedro) feliz. from our perspective,\\nthe safety squeeze that was done by jason bartlett, the wonderful\\ndefensive plays.  the little things  i want that to be the focal\\npoint next season. we\\'re going to be the target  that\\'s beautiful.\\nfor us to be able to withstand the challenge, i don\\'t want us to\\nplay the game any better in a sense of hit more home runs, i want\\nus to play the game better fundamentally.\\n\\nwhat\\'s striking about the players in the clubhouse?\\n\\nthe unity. the closeness. the support among each other. again we\\nwent from a very low trust organization to a very high trust\\norganization, built on relationships. and all the right internal\\nworkings are in place to make this successful for many years to\\ncome.\\n\\nthe national debate surrounding your handling of the bullpen in\\ngame 5?\\n\\nit is amusing. that\\'s exactly how we had it laid out, it just\\ndidn\\'t work. if they get a couple knocks, it\\'s always going to make\\nit look wrong. i have had so much confidence in all these pitchers\\nall year, and that\\'s what people have to understand. we wouldn\\'t be\\nsitting here right now if it wasn\\'t for that group of people right\\nthere. truly the bullpen probably is as important as any aspect of\\nour game this year. and those guys have had a great year, and to\\nsay that i should have done something differently would admit that\\ni did not have confidence in those people, which, to me, is wrong.\\n\\nhow different everything\\n\\nis right now?\\n\\nit is different. it\\'s entirely different. the whole vibe is\\ndifferent. we\\'ve arrived as an organization, and as a force within\\nmajor-league baseball. and our guys now have a national face, and i\\nlike that. one of the most gratifying things that have occurred\\nthroughout this postseason is how well our players represented us,\\nand i\\'m really proud of that.\\n\\nthoughts on the growing excitement around the area about the\\nrays?\\n\\nit\\'s very exciting. i was just driving over the gandy bridge\\n(thursday) and the guy on the other side just setting up shop on\\nthe grass with a table with some rays (t-shirts), he had it\\nadvertised. i\\'m thinking to myself, \"oh, my god, how has that\\nhappened?\" you\\'re talking about arriving. i\\'ve often talked about\\ngoing to europe and i want to see some rays gear on just anybody\\nwalking down the street somehow. and i will take a photograph. the\\nfact people know who we were and they know how we play. i think a\\nlot of people embraced a lot of what we\\'re about.\\n\\ntampa  coach barry melrose

22:57, respectively.\\n\\nst. louis averaged 21:22 entering saturday, lecavalier 19:22.\\n\\n\"i\\'m sure they don\\'t like it,\" melrose said.\\n\\nlecavalier has said he would prefer playing 20 to 21 minutes.\\nst. louis, too, said he wouldn\\'t mind a few more.\\n\\n\"i\\'m not complaining,\" he said. \"but there are games when you\\nfeel you want to be out there more, especially when you feel great.\\n\\nare 25 minutes too much? a little bit; over a long period of time,\\nabsolutely. but i think it all depends on where we are in the\\ngame.\"\\n\\nthe main cut for lecavalier has been in penalty-kill time, of\\nwhich he had just 37 seconds in his previous seven games.\\n\\n\"some nights they\\'ll play 23, 24 minutes if we\\'re down a\\ngoal,\" melrose said. \"but i\\'d like to keep

columnist\\n\\njacksonville  it was as close as anyone will ever get to a\\nperfect crime on a field of play.\\n\\nit did not merit a penalty, and it probably won\\'t draw a\\nreprimand from the league office. there will be no youtube video to\\npoint at and no angry words to recall.\\n\\nthere is absolutely no evidence urban meyer did anything wrong\\nsaturday.\\n\\nunless you want to count the embarrassed looks on the faces of\\nthe georgia bulldogs when they might as well have had their pants\\npulled down around their knees in the final minute of florida\\'s\\n49-10 victory.\\n\\nfor no discernible reason other than revenge, the gators called\\nconsecutive timeouts with 44 and 30 seconds remaining in a runaway\\ngame. there was no attempt to run the score up. no angry gestures\\non the sideline. just an implied middle finger salute from one\\nrival to another.\\n\\n\"we were enjoying the moment, enjoying the game,\" florida\\nquarterback tim tebow said. \"we didn\\'t do anything wrong. we were\\njust playing the game.\"\\n\\nconsider it a crime of passion. for more than a year, the gators\\nhave lived with the memory of georgia\\'s 42-30 victory that\\nessentially buried florida\\'s chances for a southeastern conference\\ntitle in 2007. more than that, they lived with the humiliation of\\nthe dawgs doing a team-wide end zone dance after an early\\ntouchdown.\\n\\nstrength and conditioning coach mickey marotti had a photo of\\nthe georgia boogie mounted in his office almost from the moment it\\nhappened. more photos showed up on the lockers of florida players\\nlast week.\\n\\nthroughout offseason workouts, the gators were reminded of how\\nsoft they played against georgia when marotti pushed them to do\\nrepeated sets of push-ups, sit-ups and crunches. depending on the\\nworkout, the players had to do 42 (for georgia\\'s points) or 188\\n(for running back knowshon moreno\\'s rushing total) reps.\\n\\n\"this was a lot off of our shoulders,\" safety ahmad black\\nsaid. \"all we\\'ve heard is georgia, georgia, georgia.\"\\n\\nthe subjects of dancing and payback were off-limits around\\ngainesville last week. meyer would not let his players talk about\\nit, and he avoided the subject himself. the best gauge of the\\nflorida coach\\'s feelings was a passage in a recent biography when\\nhe suggested florida would find a way to \"handle\" the slight.\\n\\nso maybe the intent of tebow\\'s 25-yard touchdown pass with 11:30\\nremaining could be debated. and even the 7-yard touchdown pass by\\nbackup quarterback john brantley in the final eight minutes is open\\nto interpretation.\\n\\nbut, really, there is no mistaking the purpose behind the\\ntimeouts. unless you want to argue which timeout was kiss-my-butt\\nand which was stick-it-in-your-ear.\\n\\nfor the record, meyer said the timeouts were simply a way to get\\nextra carries for running back emmanuel moody. later, however,\\nmeyer touched on the importance of respecting the game.\\n\\nmaybe that was a jab at georgia\\'s behavior last season, or maybe\\nit was an explanation for his subtle retaliation saturday. perhaps\\nit was a little bit of both.\\n\\nno matter how he wanted to spin it, the message was received.\\nmeyer and georgia coach mark richt did a drive-by handshake at\\nmidfield when the game was finally completed.\\n\\nmeanwhile, when the final timeouts were called, the bleachers at\\njacksonville municipal stadium told the story as accurately as the\\nscoreboard. the georgia side of the stadium was nearly empty, and\\nthe florida side was getting revved up for the postgame\\ncelebrations.\\n\\n\"we looked over at their sideline and saw all of their fans had\\ngone,\" receiver percy harvin said. \"we just wanted to rub it in a\\nlittle bit, but not too much.\"\\n\\nso if last season\\'s loss kept florida out of the sec title game,\\nsaturday\\'s victory ensures the gators control their own destiny in\\n2008. a victory next week against vanderbilt will clinch the\\neastern division title and a date in atlanta on dec. 6.\\n\\nas for the bulldogs, they began the season as the no. 1 team

texas here saturday night in front of a\\nrecord crowd of 56,333 rowdy fans at jones at&amp;amp;t stadium, leach took\\nhis team from a novelty act in a remote college town to the center\\nof the college football universe.\\n\\nafter falling behind 33-32 for the first time with 1:29\\nremaining in the game, red raiders quarterback graham harrell\\ndirected a six-play, 62-yard drive to win the

edward britton and was dropped by texas\\nsafety blake gideon.\\n\\nthe victory is the biggest in texas tech history and the first\\nover a top-ranked team and puts the red raiders squarely in the\\nmidst of the national championship chase along with no. 2 alabama\\n(9-0, 5-0 sec) and no. 3 penn state (9-0, 5-0 big ten) and muddles\\nthe race in the big 12 south division. it also gives hope

state and at oklahoma before ending the\\nregular season against baylor.\\n\\nsaturday\\'s game also shook up the heisman trophy race. longhorns\\nquarterback colt mccoy had been the clear front-runner for the\\naward, but can now see harrell and florida quarterback tim tebow in\\nthe rear-view mirror.\\n\\ntexas (8-1, 4-1 big 12) had been trying to be just the second\\nteam to have beaten four consecutive top 11 teams in the associated\\npress poll since notre dame did it in 1943.\\n\\nleading 22-6 at halftime, texas tech punted on its first\\npossession of the second half and surrendered a 45-yard punt return\\nfor touchdown by texas wide receiver jordan shipley with 10:26\\nremaining in the third quarter.\\n\\nbut less than three minutes later, mccoy tried to find shipley\\njust beyond his own 20-yard line and had his pass intercepted and\\nreturned 18 yards by texas tech strong safety daniel charbonnet for\\na touchdown and a 29-13 advantage.\\n\\ntexas, however, scored again near the end of the third quarter\\non a 37-yard touchdown pass by mccoy to wide receiver malcolm\\nwilliams to pull within 29-19 of texas tech.\\n\\nthat was the start of texas tech\\'s near unraveling. the\\nlonghorns blocked the 42-yard field goal attempt of kicker matt\\nwilliams. on the next play, mccoy tossed a 91-yard touchdown pass\\nto williams to cut texas tech\\'s lead to 29-26 with 11:00 left.\\n\\nbut the red raiders remained calm on their next possession and\\ncapped a 13-play, 55-yard drive with a 42-yard field goal by kicker\\ndonnie carona to extend their advantage to 32-26 with 5:45\\nremaining.\\n\\ntexas answered right back on vondrell mcgee\\'s 4-yard touchdown\\nrun for a 33-32 lead with 1:29 left for its lone lead of the night,\\nonly to give away to crabtree\\'s heroics.\\n\\nfrom the outset saturday night, texas struggled. on its first\\noffensive play from its own 2-yard line, tailback chris ogbonnya\\nwas tackled in the end zone for a safety to give texas tech a 2-0\\nlead with 10:38 remaining in the first quarter.\\n\\nafter texas\\' ensuing kick, texas tech scored on williams\\'\\n29-yard field goal with 6:47 left in the first quarter.\\n\\nfollowing a 60-yard texas punt, texas tech took over at its own\\n4-yard line and meticulously drove 96 yards in 10 plays to score on\\ntailback baron butch\\'s 3-yard run to go ahead 12-0 to end the first\\nquarter.\\n\\ntexas stalled again on its third possession, but pushed texas\\ntech back to its own 17-yard line with a 67-yard punt. that hardly\\nslowed the red raiders.\\n\\nfacing third-and-14 from texas 32-yard line, harrell held the\\nball for almost 10 seconds and retreated to near mid-field before\\ncompleting a 14-yard pass to crossing wide receiver lyle leong near\\nthe right sideline for a first down.\\n\\non the next play, he threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to wide\\nreceiver eric morris to extend texas tech\\'s lead to 19-0 with 9:39\\nremaining in the second quarter.\\n\\ntexas finally scored with 5:27 left in the second quarter on\\nkicker hunter lawrence\\'s 43-yard field goal, was set up by the\\nrecovery of a texas tech fumble at the red raiders 29-yard line.\\n\\nthe teams traded field goals to in the final 1:37 of the second\\nquarter that left texas tech ahead 22-6 at halftime.\\n\\nafter the winning touchdown, texas tech fans ran on to the field\\nthree times prematurely before the game ended after texas\\' failed\\nkickoff return. a sign said, \"our time our house.\"\\n\\ntexas tech and leach have arrived.\\n\\nquarterback jeff garcia has a solution for his team\\'s inability\\nto score touchdowns when it gets into the red zone  that area of\\nthe field between the opponent\\'s 20-yard line and the goal line\\nthat has been a dead zone for the bucs this season.  take a chance.\\nthrow some caution  and maybe a football  to the wind. give the\\nguys with flypaper hands a chance to snag a pass from a defender.\\n\\n\"we can\\'t go into every single play like there\\'s going to be a\\nperfect outlet, that there\\'s going to be a person wide open and i\\'m\\ngoing to hit that player and he\\'s going to be able to run and make\\na first down,\" garcia said. \"sometimes, we just need to be\\nplaymakers, and we need to allow our playmakers  which are our\\nreceivers, our tight ends  to sometimes go up and outfight a\\ndefender for a football. and we need to trust in that. i think we\\nget caught up into being such a rhythm-type team, looking for the\\nbest outlet, looking for the open receiver, that we lose sight of\\njust taking shots at times and just taking chances.\"\\n\\nit\\'s mystifying, really. the bucs offense is 13th in the nfl,\\naveraging more than 341 yards per game. but in red zone scoring,\\ntampa bay is 29th in the league with only 11 touchdowns in 31\\ntrips, a percentage of 35.5.\\n\\nno matter how easily the bucs breeze up and down the field,\\ntheir trek inside the dead zone is like traversing a desert on a\\nbroken ankle over shards of glass.\\n\\ntake last week\\'s 13-9 loss at dallas. tampa bay settled for\\nthree field goals, and the game ended when the bucs failed to\\nconvert on fourth and 5 at the cowboys 18.\\n\\ngarcia didn\\'t throw one pass to the end zone. sometimes under\\nduress, he checked the ball down to tight end jerramy stevens or\\nwideout ike hilliard on shallow crossing routes. despite having\\nthree timeouts when the drive started, the bucs only attempted\\npasses on their final 11 plays.\\n\\non the last play, receiver joey galloway put a double move on\\ncowboys cornerback alan ball, who slipped, leaving galloway alone\\nin the end zone. but garcia never saw him, throwing incomplete to\\nstevens.\\n\\n\"unfortunately, jeff didn\\'t have a chance to see it,\" galloway\\nsaid. \"that\\'s one of those things where half the play was really\\ngood and we didn\\'t finish it, so it doesn\\'t really matter.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve never been a guy that scored much inside the red zone.\\ni\\'ve been a guy that scored outside the red zone. so, of course,\\nwith that in mind, i\\'d like to let coach know let\\'s go from outside\\nthe red zone.\"\\n\\nthe bucs\\' red zone production has been even worse during their\\nthree losses  all on the road. tampa bay has scored two touchdowns\\nin nine trips, or 22 percent of the time.\\n\\none problem has been the bucs\\' inability  or unwillingness  to\\nrun in the red zone. when the field gets shorter, it\\'s much easier\\nfor defenses to stack the line of scrimmage.\\n\\n\"that\\'s every red zone tape we look at,\" coach jon gruden\\nsaid. \"i think our first-down carries last week, we lost yards\\ntwice. and we got stopped on third down on one. and we do have a\\npretty good quarterback here, and we\\'re going to try to accentuate\\nanything we\\'ve got to do to win a football game. if we\\'ve got to\\nthrow it every snap, we will.\"\\n\\ninjuries have been a factor. the bucs lost fullback byron storer\\nfor the season when he tore his right acl against the panthers.\\nstarter b.j. askew hasn\\'t played since tearing his hamstring in\\nweek 3 at chicago. last week, warrick dunn was limited because of a\\npinched nerve in his back.\\n\\n\"we had fresh, good players, and we had a neat little rotation\\ngoing,\" gruden said of the rushing attack earlier this season.\\n\"obviously, with warrick\\'s injury lingering and two fullbacks out,\\nit\\'s something we\\'ve got to all clean up. we\\'ve got to fight\\nthrough this, we\\'ve got to do some things better, and that we\\nwill.\"\\n\\ngarcia says the bucs have good red zone practices each friday,\\nbut so far, they haven\\'t been able to carry over into games.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know why it\\'s not carrying over,\" garcia said. \"you\\nlook at the situations we had this past game. we unfortunately on\\nthird and 1 don\\'t convert a third down. we see a defense we didn\\'t\\nprepare for. should that matter? it shouldn\\'t matter. we should\\nfind a way. we didn\\'t make it happen. the next time we\\'re down in\\nthe red zone, i get the penalty for crossing the line of scrimmage.\\nwe get into a third-and-long situation. we become our own worst\\nenemy when we get down to the red zone.\"\\n\\ngruden spent the week admitting his play-calling in red zone\\nsituations could have been better. but garcia bears a little of the\\nblame, too. sometimes, he says, a quarterback has to squeeze a\\nthrow and hope for the best.\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t do a very good job, and we didn\\'t play well enough as\\na team,\" gruden said. \"we\\'ve all got to throw our hat in there\\nand assume some responsibility, but i\\'ve got a lot of confidence in\\njeff. hopefully we can all get clicking again.\"\\n\\ngarcia said his training in the west coast offense taught him to\\nthink touchdown, then check down, whenever his team gets in the red\\nzone. coaches such as the late bill walsh and the seahawks\\' mike\\nholmgren have been notorious for trying to strike as soon as they\\nreach the opponent\\'s 20-yard line.\\n\\n\"i think somehow, some way, we need to find a way to be back in\\nthat sort of mode,\" garcia said. \"i think with how we\\'ve played\\nrecently in the red zone, we\\'ve missed out on a lot of great\\nopportunities.\\n\\n\"and when you\\'re in those last two minutes, it is important to\\ntake some shots to the end zone.\"\\n\\nred zone efficiency (tds), through week 8\\n      top 5\\n      team /poss. /tds /fgs /score % / td

authorities said, he\\nbeat\\nthem to death.\\n\\nduring the mid-1980s, police had a suspect for these acts, henry\\nlee\\nbethune, but no hard evidence linking him to a crime scene. then a\\nsergeant in the houston police department\\'s homicide division, jim\\nyarbrough, read a magazine article on the first use of dna to solve\\na\\ncrime mystery in england.\\n\\nyarbrough called the pioneering scientist, an english geneticist\\nnamed\\nalec jeffreys, setting off a chain of events that would lead to the\\nconviction of bethune -- one of the first texas criminals convicted\\nwith\\ndna evidence -- on charges of raping a 74-year-old woman.\\n\\nthis friday marks the 20th anniversary of that conviction -- the\\nfirst\\nbased on dna in a harris county proceeding.\\n\\n\"it\\'s hard to believe now, but at that time there were no\\nlaw-enforcement dna labs in the united states,\" recalled rusty\\nhardin,\\nwho prosecuted the bethune case when he was assistant district\\nattorney.\\n\"essentially, dna was not being used forensically yet.\"\\n\\nthe scientific witness in the trial, dr. c. thomas caskey, went\\non to\\ninvent the dna testing standard now used worldwide by crime labs.\\n\\nat the time of the trial, the goal was simply to end a string of\\ncrimes\\nin which elderly women were beaten and raped. a victim testified\\nthat\\nbethune, who was suspected in at least 14 rapes as well as two\\nmurders,\\nhad told her he preferred old women, because \"young women all have\\ndiseases.\"\\n\\nhardin said he had confidence in the testimony of the victim.\\nbut it\\'s\\noften hard, he said, to get a jury to convict on the basis of such\\nevidence alone.\\n\\nthe jury foreman, stan curry, said at the time, \"the dna just\\ncinched\\nit.\"\\n\\nback then, using dna evidence seemed like a stretch. yarbrough\\nsaid he\\nlearned from his call to jeffreys, the english geneticist, that\\nthere\\nwere only two commercial dna laboratories in the u.s. in 1986 and\\nno\\ngovernment labs.\\n\\nyarbrough collected samples from bethune and sent those, along\\nwith\\ncrime scene material, to the two labs.\\n\\nboth returned \"hits\"; there was just a one in 700 million\\nchance that\\nsomeone other than henry lee bethune had left a semen sample on the\\nmattress of the 74-year-old houston woman.\\n\\nhardin said the two labs offered experts to testify at trial but\\ntold\\nhim there was no better witness than a dna expert in houston.\\n\\n\"i go, \\'well, who is that?\\' \" hardin recalled. \"it was tom\\ncaskey. i had\\nnever met him.\"\\n\\ncaskey was director of the molecular genetics program at baylor\\ncollege\\nof medicine and was interested in getting into forensic dna. at the\\ntrial, he grew tired of a litany of dna questions that didn\\'t seem\\nto\\nhave much to do with the case.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think they understood the questions they were asking,\\nand i\\'m\\ncertain they didn\\'t understand the answers,\" caskey said of the\\ndefense\\nattorneys. \"so at one point, i responded, \\'i\\'m sorry, you are just\\ngoing\\nto have to ask better questions.\\' the judge didn\\'t like that very\\nmuch.\"\\n\\nhardin added, \"ahh, but the jury did.\"\\n\\nbethune, who later was convicted of raping another 74-year-old\\nwoman,\\nremains incarcerated and has been denied parole.\\n\\ncaskey\\'s primary scientific interest at the time involved the\\nidentification of genes linked to human disease. but, during the\\ncourse\\nof his research, he identified short segments of dna -- called short\\ntandem repeats, or strs -- that vary widely from person to person.\\n\\nhis lab developed an str identification technique that soon\\nbecame the\\ngold standard for criminal cases.\\n\\nthe method underlies the u.s. combined dna index system, or\\ncodis, which\\ncontains dna information on more than 6 million offenders. the\\nsystem\\nalso forms the basis of interpol\\'s criminal database and that of\\nmost\\ngovernments.\\n\\nafter he developed the system, caskey testified at the first dna\\ncases\\nheld in various federal districts. he was often asked by defense\\nattorneys whether he stood to benefit from the new technology.\\n\\n\"i got mad about it, so i told my dean i was going to give him\\nall of my\\npatents,\" caskey said.\\n\\ntoday, the patents provide baylor with enough annual revenue to\\nfund the\\neducation of eight students working to obtain medical or doctorate\\ndegrees.\\n\\n\"don\\'t ever say crime doesn\\'t pay. crime does pay,\" quipped\\ncaskey, who\\nnow directs the brown foundation institute of molecular medicine\\nfor the\\nprevention of human diseases, a part of the university of texas\\nhealth\\nscience center at houston.\\n\\nboth caskey and hardin say incidents such as the o.j. simpson\\ntrial and\\nthe failings of houston\\'s crime lab have tarnished dna science.\\n\\n\"assuming everything\\'s done properly, the science is not going\\nto lie,\"\\nsaid hardin, now a prominent defense attorney.\\n\\nafter two decades, the science is more promising than ever, said\\ndavid\\ngangitano, an assistant professor at sam houston state university\\nand a\\nforensic dna expert.\\n\\nnew techniques are making it possible to identify criminals with\\nmuch\\nsmaller samples of dna.\\n\\nand as the price to sequence dna falls, it\\'s possible that\\nforensic\\nscientists will soon be able to match the pollen on a suspect\\'s\\nclothing\\nwith specific trees or use the dna of a drug plant to determine its\\nprecise point of origin.\\n\\nmoreover, dna from a crime scene may soon allow police to\\ndetermine a\\nperpetrator\\'s eye color, hair color, race or other traits that\\nmight aid\\nthem in the apprehension of a suspect.\\n\\nstate of the league at midseason we\\'re halfway through the nfl\\nseason, so time for our midseason report.\\n\\nmost surprising team it seems bizarre to consider a team that is\\n3-4 as a surprise, but we were tempted to put miami in this slot.\\nthe dolphins won one game last season and this season already have\\nvictories over new england and san diego. with parity in the nfl,\\nit\\'s surprising when any team is undefeated at the end of october.\\nbut who would have thought the titans would lose qb vince young\\nalmost from the start and be 7-0 at this point with journeyman\\nkerry collins at quarterback? so we go with the titans.\\n\\ncoach of the year\\n\\nplenty of good candidates out there, such as washington\\'s jim\\nzorn, buffalo\\'s dick jauron, miami\\'s tony sparano and, yes, even\\nbill belichick, who has the patriots at 5-2 without qb tom brady.\\nbut we\\'re starting to think tennessee\\'s jeff fisher just might be\\nthe best coach in all of football. do you realize he is in his 15th\\nseason with the titans? in fact, he goes back to the houston days.\\nand he is 122-99 for his career, including an improbable 7-0 this\\nseason.\\n\\nother surprising teams\\n\\nthe redskins are 6-2 mostly because qb jason campbell, below,\\nhas not thrown an interception this season. the bills (5-2) got off\\nto their best start since 1992. and though they have faded, the\\nbroncos are still 4-3 and lead the afc west.\\n\\nmost disappointing team\\n\\nwe knew the colts were starting to slip a little, but not only\\nare they 3-4, they easily could be 1-6 had it not been for a couple\\nof big-time, fourth-quarter comebacks. they were blown out last\\nweek by the titans, and they likely will not win the afc south for\\nthe first time since 2002.\\n\\nother disappointing teams\\n\\nsome thought jacksonville was a super bowl contender, but the\\njaguars sit right with the colts at 3-4. cleveland and minnesota\\nwere supposed to be better than 3-4. and although philadelphia\\n(4-3) and dallas (5-3) have winning records, both teams have been\\nup and down.\\n\\nmost surprising player\\n\\nquite frankly, we had forgotten kerry collins, above, even\\nplayed in the league. we were reminded when titans qb vince young\\nwent down and wigged out after one game. collins isn\\'t exactly\\nwinning games (he has only three touchdown passes), but he isn\\'t\\nlosing games, either (he has only three interceptions).\\n\\nmost disappointing player\\n\\nhe hasn\\'t been a bust, but qb brett favre, above, hasn\\'t turned\\nthe jets into super bowl contenders. he is having an okay season\\n(15 touchdowns, 11 interceptions), and, thus, the jets are having\\nan okay season at 4-3. then comes word that he might have shared\\nold packers secrets with the lions. is anyone truly happy this guy\\nunretired?\\n\\noffensive mvp\\n\\nactually, we\\'re going to go with co-mvps from the same team.\\nwashington qb jason campbell and rb clinton portis, above, are\\nplaying the kind of football that not only has helped the redskins\\nbuild a 6-2 record, but it\\'s the kind that wins in the playoffs.\\ncampbell has been error-free while compiling the fifth-best\\nquarterback rating in the nfl. meanwhile, portis averages 118 yards\\na game and, barring injury, will win the rushing title  easily.\\n\\ndefensive mvp\\n\\nbecause we went with co-mvps on offense, we will do the same on\\ndefense. we have 11 co-mvps  the entire titans defense. keith\\nbulluck, above, and the titans are allowing fewer than two\\ntouchdowns a game (12.4 points). only one team has scored more than\\n17 in a game against tennessee, and that was last week when the\\ncolts scored a late meaningless touchdown to finish with 21.\\n\\nrookie of the year\\n\\nnot only has qb matt ryan, above, made falcons fans forget about\\nthe past and michael vick, but he has them thinking about the\\nfuture and the playoffs. maybe the postseason is a stretch, but\\nryan is playing better than rookies are supposed to play at that\\nposition. he has more touchdown passes (seven) than interceptions\\n(five), and this is the big number: the falcons are 4-3.\\n\\nfive biggest stories of the first

presidential\\ncandidate ingrid betancourt.\\n\\nbut in some ways, military analysts say, the colombian army has\\nbecome a\\nvictim of its own success.\\n\\nsince 2002, the number of colombian troops has nearly doubled to\\nabout\\n263,000. as the army expanded, oversight lapsed. yet accusations of\\nhuman rights abuses were often dismissed by officials as\\nrebel-inspired\\ncampaigns to

political obscurity to be his\\nrunning mate, it became inevitable that american voters would make\\nhistory in 2008. either the united states would choose its first\\npresident of african ancestry or its first female vice president.\\n\\nwhichever party wins the election, \"nothing\\'s going to look the\\nsame,\"\\nsaid stan greenberg, a democratic pollster who conducts bipartisan\\nsurveys for national public radio.\\n\\nbut the 2008 election, which concludes at polling places on\\ntuesday\\nafter weeks of record-setting early voting, will be historic for\\nmany\\nreasons beyond race and gender.\\n\\nit is the first election during a deep economic crisis since\\n1932, when\\ndemocratic challenger franklin d. roosevelt routed republican\\npresident\\nherbert hoover as the nation sank into the depths of the great\\ndepression. since then, six presidential campaigns have taken place\\nduring economic slumps and only once, in 1972, has the party in\\ncharge\\nof the white house survived.\\n\\n\"one of the safest propositions in american history is, when\\nthere are\\nsevere economic downturns that affect millions of people, then it\\'s\\nthe\\nparty in power that suffers the most,\" said rice university\\npolitical\\nscientist earl black.\\n\\nthe 2008 election also is a rare wartime contest -- just the\\nseventh in a\\ncentury. in the past wartime choices, incumbent presidents were\\nre-elected all three times they ran. but the party in power was\\nvoted\\nout of office in the three races when the incumbent was not on the\\nballot, the last time when lyndon johnson pulled out of the 1968\\nrace.\\n\\nhistory also tells us that american voters like to change the\\nparty in\\nthe white house every eight years. this year\\'s election is the\\nsixth\\ntime in the post-fdr era of term limits that a party in power is\\ntrying\\nto win the presidency in three straight elections. only once --\\ngeorge\\nh.w. bush in 1988 -- did the \"in\" party succeed.\\n\\n\"it\\'s kind of a perfect storm for democrats,\" said jim\\ngranato, director\\nof the university of houston\\'s center for public policy. \"you\\'ve\\ngot an\\nunpopular war, a severe economic crisis and it\\'s unusual for an\\nincumbent party to win three consecutive elections.\"\\n\\nthe 2008 election is also a rare generational contest pitting\\ncandidates\\n25 years apart in age. in the two similar generation-gap elections\\nof\\nthe 20th century, the younger candidate, baby boomer bill clinton,\\ndefeated world war ii veterans george h.w. bush and bob dole. and\\nin the\\nother generational shift of modern times, voters in 1960 chose the\\nnation\\'s first roman catholic president, 43-year-old john f.\\nkennedy, to\\nreplace 68-year-old dwight d. eisenhower.\\n\\nthis year\\'s election could mark the end of three decades of\\nbitter\\npost-vietnam politics and with it the discussions of swift boats,\\ndraft\\nevasion, national guard records and anti-war bomb plots. after all,\\nobama was 6 years old when mccain\\'s skyhawk dive-bomber was shot\\ndown\\nover hanoi.\\n\\nthe generational divide is evident in the electorate. obama\\nholds a\\ndouble-digit lead among voters under the age of 45, while mccain\\nhas an\\nedge among voters older than the democratic nominee. for\\nrepublicans,\\nthe risk is that the largest generation in american history will\\nbecome\\nloyal democrats, much as ronald reagan and franklin roosevelt\\ninfluenced\\ntwo different generations in the 20th century.\\n\\n\"there\\'s not just a lost election (at stake) here, there\\'s a\\nlost\\ngeneration,\" said democratic strategist james carville.\\n\\nrepublicans face other demographic risks this year. hispanic\\nvoters, who\\ncast nearly 40 percent of their ballots for republican george w.\\nbush in\\n2004, are siding with obama by margins of about 2-to-1, according\\nto\\nnumerous polls. the strong anti-gop backlash among latinos has\\ncomplicated mccain\\'s chances in traditionally republican states\\nsuch as\\nnevada, colorado and florida.\\n\\n\"republicans are in a very bad way (among hispanics),\" said\\nuniversity\\nof houston political scientist granato.\\n\\ndespite mccain\\'s support for giving illegal immigrants a pathway\\nto\\ncitizenship, he added, \"the republican brand is viewed as being\\nhostile\\nto immigrants.\"\\n\\ngiven all of the historical precedents that favor the democrats,\\none of\\nthe surprises of 2008 is that mccain has remained competitive for\\nso\\nmany months, said rice\\'s black. he points out that the republican\\nnominee continues to hold a large advantage as the candidate better\\nqualified to serve as commander-in-chief.\\n\\nbut to houston council member jolanda

241 yards and three touchdowns to guide the\\nuniversity of\\nmassachusetts (6-2, 3-2 colonial) to a 49-0 triumph over the rhode\\nisland\\n(2-8, 0-6) before a meade stadium crowd of 7,201.\\n\\n\"liam coen just continues to do what he does,\" said umass\\ncoach don\\nbrown. \"and that\\'s be efficient, run the offense, 15 of 17\\n((completions))\\n.. he was special today and, i\\'ll also add, less than 100 percent,\\nso\\ntaking him out in the third quarter was precautionary.\".\\n\\nthe victory not only bolstered umass\\'s postseason hopes but\\navenged a 12-6\\nloss to the rams here a year ago in which coen, playing in severe\\nweather\\nconditions produced by hurricane noel, completed 7 of 22 passes for\\n22\\nyards with two interceptions. yesterday, coen was a picture of\\nefficiency.\\nhe guided the minutemen to scores on their first six possessions,\\ncompleting 88.2 percent of his passes for the second-highest\\ncompletion\\npercentage in school history behind tim day\\'s 89.4 percent (17 of\\n19) in\\nthe 2004 opener against delaware state.\\n\\n\"all i have to say this year is that there was no rain,\" said\\ncoen, who\\ndeparted with 13:10 left in the third quarter after he connected\\nwith\\nvictor cruz (7 catches, 129 yards, 2 tds) on a 35-yard td strike\\nthat made\\nit 42-0.\\n\\n\"honestly, i don\\'t like going back on last year, but you saw\\nwhat happened\\ntoday and there was no rain,\" coen said. \"it wouldn\\'t have\\nhappened last\\nyear.\"\\n\\njunior running back tony nelson rushed 12 times for 65 yards,\\nand tallied\\numass\\'s first two touchdowns (his ninth and 10th of the season) on\\nruns of\\n2 and 13 yards. the 15th-ranked minutemen shut out the rams by\\nforcing\\nthree turnovers (two interceptions, one fumble), limiting uri to 19\\nrushing\\nyards on 40 attempts, and ringing up eight sacks for 55 yards,\\nincluding\\nfour in the first half on derek cassidy (13 of 24, 185 yards, two\\ninterceptions).\\n\\njosh jennings, a 6-foot, 220-pound junior middle linebacker,\\nintercepted\\ncassidy both times, the first of which set up nelson\\'s 2-yard td\\nrun and\\nthe second which he returned 40 yards for a touchdown to give the\\nminutemen\\na 35-0 halftime lead.\\n\\n\"we tried not to give ((cassidy)) a chance to breathe today and\\nwe\\ncertainly made his pass difficult,\" brown said. \"we played very,\\nvery\\nsolidly against the run, which made them truly one-dimensional, and\\nthen we\\njust took care of business.\"\\n\\nthe rams, who mustered 212 total yards, came up empty when louis\\nfeinstein\\nmissed first-half field goal attempts of 40 and 34 yards.\\n\\nsophomore defensive back shane viveiros of fall river, mass.,\\npreserved\\numass\\'s first shutout since a 7-0 blanking of northeastern in 2006\\nwhen he\\nstymied uri\\'s two other scoring bids, sacking cassidy for a 16-yard\\nloss on\\nfourth down from the umass 5, then recovering cassidy\\'s fumble at\\nthe umass\\n18.\\n\\n\"i was just trying to be a spark of energy for our team,\" said\\nviveiros.\\n\\nso, too, was coen. but once his work was done, there was nothing\\nleft for\\nhim to do but reflect on his final trip home as a collegian.\\n\\n\"it really doesn\\'t get much better than that,\" coen said.\\n\"any game you\\ncan sit back and go, \\'hey, i did what i had to do and the team did\\nwhat it\\nhad to do,\\' you feel good about yourself and you feel good about\\nthe way\\nyou finished.\"\\n\\nmichael vega can be reached at vega@globe.com.\\n\\nthe bruins had long skated off the td banknorth garden ice last\\nnight with\\na 5-1 win tucked in their pockets, but marc savard was still\\nwatching the\\nreplays of the third-period melee, marveling especially at how\\nshane hnidy\\ntuned up dallas counterpart matt niskanen.\\n\\nthere is a faction among hockey watchers that turns its\\ncollective nose up\\nat the fights and brawls that were the norm three decades ago. but\\nlast\\nnight, one of the few occasions when the gloves drop and the fists\\nfly in\\nsuccession, players become fans as well, hungry to consume the\\nrough stuff\\nthat has been nearly bleached out of the genteel nhl.\\n\\n\"i think the fans may have had a flashback to the old days on\\ncauseway\\nstreet,\" said aaron ward. \"the game hasn\\'t really gone this way.\\nbut\\nsometimes situations call for teams rallying together and sticking\\nup for\\neach other. that\\'s what you saw tonight.\"\\n\\nbefore last night, the bruins had practically been peaceniks.\\nthey had\\nengaged in only two fights all season (a pair of shawn thornton\\nbouts\\nagainst montreal\\'s georges laraque and pittsburgh\\'s eric godard),\\njust one\\nmore than the nhl\\'s pacifists in detroit and minnesota.\\n\\nbut when the stars, led by agitators sean avery and steve ott\\n(the new\\nmcfilthy and mcnasty?), tried to swagger their way into the garden\\nand push\\nthe bruins around, their hosts responded.\\n\\nwith their fists.\\n\\nto a man, the bruins were just as proud for the way they stuck\\nup for each\\nother as they were with the result: a victory before 14,576 fans\\nwho got\\nevery penny of their money\\'s worth.\\n\\nthe bruins survived a second-period barrage in which tim thomas\\nturned\\naside all 21 pucks that were fired his way. marco sturm, who came\\nin with\\njust one goal this season, put two pucks behind goalie marty turco.\\nthe\\nboston penalty kill, dead last in the league, killed off all six\\ndallas\\npower plays, including a 45-second two-man advantage in the second\\nperiod.\\n\\nbut they turned the agitating ways of avery and ott against the\\nstars,\\nshaming dallas and its goon squad in a won\\'t-back-down third that\\nsaw the\\ntwo clubs rack up 114 total penalty minutes.\\n\\n\"there used to be a code,\" said thornton, who threw down with\\nkrystofer\\nbarch in the only clean fight of the game, \"that if you did stuff\\nlike\\nthat, you had to answer the bell. but now, we\\'re not allowed to\\npolice the\\ngame ourselves. so they get away with a little bit more.\"\\n\\nthe bruins were first angered by an incident early in the second\\nperiod\\nwhen ott went low on stephane yelle with a hip check. thornton went\\nafter\\nott and landed several punches, but the dallas forward didn\\'t drop\\nhis\\ngloves in return. thornton was whistled for a double minor\\n(roughing) that\\ncaused his coach no dismay.\\n\\n\"yeah, thorny took a four-minute penalty,\" said julien. \"but\\nthere was a\\nguy who almost took our player\\'s knees out.\"\\n\\nlater in the period, after ott belted mark stuart, hnidy shed\\nhis gloves\\nand tried to fight the agitator. again, ott kept his gloves on. at\\n5:22,\\nanother scrum took place that saw ott, avery, hnidy, and milan\\nlucic sent\\noff for unsportsmanlike conduct penalties.\\n\\nin the third period, after andrew ference cleaned ott\\'s clock\\nwith an\\nopen-ice hit, the boston defenseman fought avery at 4:54. then at\\n7:02,\\nfollowing an interference call on turco, ott went low again on\\nlucic,\\nappearing to target the winger\\'s knees. ott and lucic were whistled\\nfor\\nroughing.\\n\\n\"not really,\" said lucic when asked if he was surprised ott\\nnever wanted\\nto fight. \"that\\'s what he tries to do. he\\'s an agitator. i\\'m not\\nreally\\nsurprised.\"\\n\\nat 9:31, with the bruins holding a 3-1 lead (patrice bergeron\\nscored the\\ngo-ahead goal in the second, phil kessel netted his seventh goal of\\nthe\\nyear in the third), thornton and barch squared off. both players\\nlanded\\npunches, with thornton managing to claw off barch\\'s helmet.\\n\\n\"i felt bad for barch to have to mop up the mess that his other\\ntwo\\nteammates couldn\\'t finish,\" julien said.\\n\\nbut the biggest explosion took place after stuart made it a 4-1\\ngame. avery\\nstapled lucic face first into the boards at 11:44, prompting savard\\nto jump\\nthe dallas forward and pop him with several rights. niskanen tried\\nto come\\nto avery\\'s aid, but was intercepted by hnidy, who delivered a\\nstring of\\nheavy rights to the defenseman\\'s head. avery was called for\\nboarding and a\\n10-minute misconduct.\\n\\n\"i think it was a hit from behind,\" savard said. \"nothing\\nother than\\ncoming in and helping a teammate. he\\'s got my back every night. i\\'m\\nnot a\\ntough guy, but just sticking up for each other. it wasn\\'t the\\ncleanest hit.\\ni\\'m just trying to help a teammate. it was getting like that in the\\nthird.\\nobviously, they\\'re a frustrated team. they\\'ve still got a couple\\ngreat\\nplayers over there. it\\'s just too bad a couple guys do the things\\nthey\\ndo.\"\\n\\nfoxborough - brandon meriweather was eventually going to replace\\nrodney\\nharrison at safety in the patriots secondary - that was the\\nlong-term plan\\n- but eventually became immediately when harrison was lost for the\\nseason\\nwith a torn right quadriceps against the broncos oct. 20.\\n\\nthe absence of harrison, one of the team\\'s spiritual and vocal\\nleaders,\\nforced meriweather not only to step up into the starting lineup\\nlast week\\nagainst the rams, but to speak up as well.\\n\\nnobody expects the soft-spoken safety to be as boisterous as\\nharrison, but\\nmeriweather needs to find his own voice while making sure he\\'s\\nheard when\\nit comes to communicating with the rest of the secondary. all\\nreports from\\nthe st. louis game were that communication was not an issue with\\nmeriweather and james sanders calling the shots in the secondary.\\n\\ncommunication will be key again for the patriots secondary\\ntonight, as it\\nfaces peyton manning and the colts at lucas oil stadium. manning is\\nthe\\nmaster of adjusting to what look a defense is giving him, and\\nmeriweather\\nand fellow starting safety sanders will have to adjust right back.\\n\\n\"we don\\'t put it all on one guy to make all the calls and\\ncontrol\\neverything. it\\'s both of them,\" said defensive coordinator dean\\npees.\\n\"they both have to make the calls. they both have to echo it to\\neach other\\nand to the corners. they\\'re both held responsible for it.\\n\\n\"just in the meetings and in practice and stuff, i didn\\'t see\\nit as any\\ndifferent if it was rodney and brandon, brandon and james, james\\nand\\nrodney. i didn\\'t see a whole lot of difference, and i hope there\\nisn\\'t any\\ndifference.\"\\n\\nthere has been a marked difference in the way meriweather has\\nperformed\\nthis year. before harrison\\'s injury he was seeing significant\\nplaying time\\nin the team\\'s nickel and dime packages.\\n\\ndespite not being a starter until last week, the second-year\\nplayer leads\\nthe patriots in interceptions with three, showing the range and\\nball-hawking skills that made him a first-round pick (24th overall)\\nin\\n2007. meriweather also has shown that he\\'s not a milquetoast.\\n\\n\"yeah, he\\'s certainly more vocal than he was as a rookie,\"\\nsaid pees. \"i\\nwould hope every week he gets more and more so, with the more\\nthings that\\nhe sees and the more he understands, not only our scheme, but he\\njust\\nunderstands what the other team is trying to do. so it has\\ndefinitely\\nimproved from a year ago.\"\\n\\nstill, the notion of replacing harrison, who was a big part of\\nthe\\npatriots\\' 24-20 victory over the colts last season, holding dallas\\nclark\\nto two catches for 15 yards, is enough to make anyone speechless.\\nmaybe\\nthat\\'s why meriweather lapsed into patriot-speak when asked about\\nit.\\n\\n\"i treat every game the same,\" he said. \"i\\'m not looking at\\nit like i\\'m\\na starter or i\\'m a backup. i just look at it like it\\'s another game\\nthat i\\nhave to go play.\"\\n\\nit\\'s ok for meriweather to be laconic with the media, as long as\\nhe isn\\'t\\non the field.\\n\\nfive-time pro bowl safety and former dallas cowboy darren\\nwoodson, now an\\nanalyst for espn, said the ability to communicate is key for any\\nsafety.\\n\\n\"you have to be a guy that\\'s vocal,\" said woodson. \"i relate\\nit to\\nplaying with roy williams ((in dallas)). williams is a soft-spoken\\nguy. he\\ndoesn\\'t like to talk. that hurt him as far as guys wanting to know\\nthe\\ncall; that just wasn\\'t his thing.\\n\\n\"brandon will have to become more vocal if he wants to remain\\nthe guy back\\nthere. the safeties don\\'t get enough credit as far as lining guys\\nup.\\nyou\\'re the quarterback in that secondary.\"\\n\\ncommunication aside, woodson said having meriweather in the\\nlineup could\\nbenefit the patriots.\\n\\nwoodson said he would have loved to have played with harrison\\nand called\\nhim an extremely smart player, but he said that the 5-foot-11-inch,\\n200-pound meriweather more closely fits the prototype for today\\'s\\nsleeker\\nsafeties - guys like bob sanders of the colts, ed reed of the\\nravens, and\\ntroy polamalu of the steelers who can cover wide receivers and\\ntight ends\\nand cover a lot of ground.\\n\\n\"((meriweather)) can go get it,\" said woodson. \"rodney\\'s\\nspeed and\\nsanders\\'s speed, they don\\'t have the same recovery speed and\\nability to\\nrecover from hashmark to hashmark,\" said woodson.\\n\\nto harrison\\'s credit, he took an active role in grooming both\\nsanders and\\nmeriweather. while some veterans would have shunned the men who\\neventually\\ncould take their jobs, harrison embraced them and taught them.\\n\\nfittingly for someone as quiet as meriweather, there wasn\\'t a\\nspeech from\\nharrison that made the most lasting impact. it was simply watching\\nhow\\nharrison went about his business that spoke volumes.\\n\\n\"hot rod, he more leads by example than by words, but the thing\\nthat he\\nmostly installed in me is play every play like it\\'s your last\\nbecause you\\nnever know when your last play is going to be,\" said meriweather.\\n\\nthat\\'s the circle of life in the nfl. somebody\\'s potential last\\nplay could\\nbe the beginning of another player\\'s elevation.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not a positive that rodney went down, but it might be a\\npositive in\\n((meriweather\\'s)) career because he can grow knowing he\\'s the guy\\nback\\nthere now,\" said woodson. \"we\\'ll find out a lot about him the\\nsecond half\\nof the season.\"\\n\\nchristopher l. gasper can be reached at cgasper@globe.com.\\n\\nthe red sox\\'

great\\nopportunity with a\\nclean slate to start from the ground up and construct something\\nthat\\'s not\\nonly a great experience while the games are going on, but we have a\\ngreat\\ndeal of fans that show up ((during workouts)).\"\\n\\nthe new stadium will have 9,999 seats, with standing room and\\nberm seating\\nthat will increase capacity to 12,000.\\n\\ncity of palms park, where the red sox have played since 1993,\\nhas a\\ncapacity of 7,290.\\n\\none of the most important parts of the new facility for the red\\nsox is that\\nit will be a single-site facility. currently, the sox have minor\\nleague\\npractice facilities in a different location. the new park will be a\\ncombined-site facility with six practice fields in addition to the\\nstadium.\\n\\nthe combined-site facility played a role in the sox\\' decision.\\n\\n\"it wasn\\'t by itself a determining factor, but it was a\\ncontributing\\nfactor,\" said dee.\\n\\nin sarasota, the sox would have had separate locations as part\\nof the payne\\npark site. other factors included appealing economic terms, access\\nto\\nhotels and shopping areas, and southwest florida international\\nairport\\'s\\nnumerous direct flights from boston.\\n\\nthe red sox will move into the new facility in 2012. the new\\nstadium will\\nbe constructed to resemble fenway. dee added that, with the vacancy\\ncoming\\nat city of palms park, the sox were on board with lee county\\nattempting to\\nlure a third team to the area, joining the sox and twins.\\n\\none piece that has not been determined is the site of the new\\npark. lee\\ncounty is relying on local landowners to donate an 80-acre plot.\\naccording\\nto dee, proposals will be requested in the next week from\\ndevelopers on a\\nsite in southern lee county. the sox will have input on the site\\ndecision.\\n\\nthough it seemed the sox were headed to sarasota, the costs\\nassociated with\\nthe new stadium there were not as favorable for them.\\n\\n\"it\\'s fair to say discussions outside of lee county heated up\\nquickly,\"\\ndee said. \"there was a period where primary discussions would have\\ntaken\\nus out of lee county, but the leadership demonstrated over the last\\neight\\nweeks, three or four, really, speaks volumes about the way they\\nfeel about\\nsports in general and the red sox.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think we were ever one foot out the door, but the lee\\ncounty\\nfolks would say they had to play catch up.\\n\\n\"there was just tremendous momentum and the county moved\\nmountains between\\nsept. 15 ((and now)). the more we looked around and the more the\\nprocess\\nmoved forward, the more we became comfortable where we are.\"\\n\\namalie benjamin can be reached at abenjamin@globe.com.\\n\\nit\\'s always interesting to hear how other people around baseball\\nthink the\\nred sox will approach their offseason.\\n\\nthe perception of a few baseball officials is that the sox\\'\\npriority is to\\ncome up with a catcher, whether it\\'s bringing back jason varitek or\\ngoing\\nanother route. one scout said, \"they\\'ll try to take care of the\\ncatching\\nfirst and then see what\\'s out there and explore a guy like ((mark))\\nteixeira or ((jake)) peavy or ((cc)) sabathia or ((a.j.)) burnett.\\nthey\\nmight even explore prince fielder because they know the yankees\\nwill. but\\nthink about it; they don\\'t have to do a whole lot. they came within\\na game\\nof going to the world series.\"\\n\\nthere are teams looking to see what the sox do with mike lowell,\\nwho told\\nteam officials after his hip surgery that it\\'s the best he\\'s felt\\nin three\\nyears in terms of range of motion and lack of pain. the real test\\nwill come\\nin spring training.\\n\\nthe other speculation revolves around coco crisp and julio lugo.\\n\\na national league general manager said, \"crisp has value. he\\nplayed very\\nwell, he\\'s fast, a great defender. lugo is a tougher sell because\\nof his\\ncontract and the fact he\\'s coming off an injury. but just look at\\nthe\\nshortstop market and you can see there\\'d be a limited market, but a\\nmarket\\nfor him nonetheless.\"\\n\\nwho\\'s the one guy teams would love

20 seconds.\\n\\nrecords are within his reach\\n\\nthe texans have won three in a row, but receiver andre johnson\\nwas sizzling\\neven before the winning streak. johnson can set two nfl records\\ntoday in\\nminnesota, as he looks to become the first player to record five\\nconsecutive games of 130 or more receiving yards and the first\\nplayer with\\nfour consecutive games of at least 10 receptions. having played in\\nseven\\ngames, johnson leads the nfl in receptions (56) and receiving yards\\n(772).\\n\\nnfl sees red over eye black\\n\\nsometimes even the best of intentions can hit players where it\\nhurts, and\\nsuch is the case for steelers safety ryan clark. after etching the\\nnumber\\n21 into his eye black to honor the late sean taylor, a former\\nteammate in\\nwashington, clark was fined $5,000 by the nfl. but the fine\\napparently\\nisn\\'t going to stop clark from doing it again. he is out with a\\nshoulder\\ninjury this week but said he planned to

losing.\"\\n\\ninjuries have hurt\\n\\nthe record has a few explanatory footnotes. manning, who\\'s off\\nto his worst\\nstart (10 touchdown passes, 9 interceptions, a 79.0 rating) since\\nhis\\nrookie year, missed most of training camp and all of the exhibition\\nseason\\nafter undergoing two midsummer knee surgeries. the offensive line\\nhas been\\npatchwork-in-progress until recently. joseph addai, the top running\\nback,\\nmissed the last two games with a hamstring injury. and sanders,\\nvoted the\\nleague\\'s best defender last year, has played in only two games.\\n\\nthe colts\\' creed (\"no excuses, no explanations\") forbids them\\nfrom\\nreciting that woeful litany. besides, new england has had even\\nworse\\nmisfortunes - quarterback tom brady, running back laurence maroney,\\nand\\nsafety rodney harrison all down for the season and the cornerback\\ncorps\\ndepleted. and yet the patriots are 5-2 and tied for their division\\nlead.\\n\\n\"they do it better than anybody i\\'ve seen,\" said dungy. \"they\\ndon\\'t\\nseem to worry about adversity. they don\\'t worry about who can\\'t\\nplay.\\n\\n\"frankly, we\\'ve taken a lesson from them. i\\'ve illustrated them\\nin the\\npast as to how they do it. they get everybody ready to go. the\\nhealthy guys\\nplay as well as they can and the new guys do their job. they\\'ve\\nbeen an\\nexample for everyone over the years.\"\\n\\nthe colts have been losing because they haven\\'t been getting the\\njob done\\nwhen it matters. the offense has lost its pyrotechnic pop and the\\ndefense\\ncan\\'t get off the field.\\n\\n\"i think our whole team is in a slump right now,\" observed\\ndungy, whose\\nsquad hasn\\'t lost more than four regular-season games since 2002.\\n\"it\\'s a\\nteam game. everybody is in it. we have to break out of it. usually,\\nit\\'s\\njust fundamentals and doing things a little bit sharper. i wouldn\\'t\\nput it\\non one person at all. i\\'m in a slump.\"\\n\\nthe offense doesn\\'t look anything like the high-speed machine\\nthat usually\\naverages around 28 points a game. the rushing attack (73.4 yards\\nper game)\\nis the league\\'s worst. manning, whose rating puts him 22d in the\\nleague,\\nhas been throwing picks and missing receivers, who\\'ve also been\\ndropping\\nballs.\\n\\n\"it seems every time that one part of our offense is failing,\"\\nsaid\\nsaturday. \"whether it be the offensive line not giving him enough\\ntime,\\nnot getting open, the ball not being in the right place. whatever\\nit may\\nbe, everybody takes their turn not getting it done.\"\\n\\nthe defense, which gave up 25 straight points in the second half\\nat\\ntennessee, can\\'t get stops when it has to. on the

did\\nin 2001, when they lost five straight after starting 4-3, prompting\\ncoach\\njim mora\\'s classic \"playoffs? playoffs?\" rant.\\n\\n\"this is a good mental test right now,\" said manning. \"this\\nis when\\nyou find out a lot about what you\\'re made of. it\\'s easy to feel\\ngood and be\\nhappy when you\\'re undefeated, but when you\\'re 3-4 and your back\\'s\\nup\\nagainst the wall,

the\\nceltics. but back-to-back game situations might not be a team\\nstrength this\\nseason, judging by a 95-79 loss to the indiana pacers last night.\\n\\nthe celtics had an 8-0 record in the second of consecutive night\\ngames last\\nseason. following a 96-80 win over chicago at td banknorth garden\\nboston\\nfriday, though, the celtics displayed the fatigue of a late\\narrival. they\\nwere also victims of some aggressive and tactically sound defending\\nby the\\npacers, who were playing their home opener.\\n\\n\"we don\\'t have to worry about that streak anymore,\" celtics\\ncoach doc\\nrivers said. \"we started off bad. we were bad all game, sloppy\\nplays,\\nmissed free throws.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know if it was them or us, but let\\'s give it to them.\\nthey just\\nplayed so much harder than us and that\\'s rare for us. they really\\nmoved the\\nball, which we didn\\'t do, and that\\'s rare for us.\\n\\n\"one thing we\\'re going to learn is we can\\'t come out flat,\\nbecause we are\\ngoing to get every team\\'s best. and, if we come out flat, we are\\ngoing to\\nget our butts whipped, and that\\'s what happened.\"\\n\\nthere were signs early on this was not going to be the celtics\\'\\nnight.\\n\\nthe celtics went 3:56 of the opening quarter without a field\\ngoal, indiana\\ngoing on a 19-6 run extending into the second quarter, which helped\\nthe\\nhosts take a 48-41 halftime lead.\\n\\nthe third quarter symbolized the celtics\\' performance - they\\ncommitted\\nseven turnovers and were 3 for 9 at the foul line.\\n\\n\"we just didn\\'t play well, in any aspect of the game,\" rivers\\nsaid. \"it\\nwas amazing, we were down 9, 10, it was a miracle. we didn\\'t\\ndeserve to win\\nthat game. we weren\\'t going to make a run, the way we were playing,\\nit was\\njust not possible.\"\\n\\nthe celtics actually demonstrated a commitment to defense,\\nindiana star\\ndanny granger (game-high 20 points) losing two front teeth as a\\nresult. but\\nthe pacers\\' defending, and the celtics\\' lack of shooting accuracy\\n(27 for\\n78, 34.6 percent) and propensity for committing traveling\\nviolations were\\ndecisive.\\n\\nthings continued to degenerate in the final quarter. indiana\\nwould score\\nwhat turned out to be the clinching points as paul pierce\\ngoaltended\\ngranger\\'s drive, giving the pacers an 81-65 lead with 7:50\\nremaining.\\n\\nthe celtics\\' shooting futility was symbolized by a possession\\nmidway\\nthrough the quarter. pierce and eddie house missed open 3-pointers\\nand t.j.\\nford transitioned for a layup and an 85-65 edge with 5:58\\nremaining.\\n\\nkevin garnett (18 points, 14 rebounds - both team highs) was the\\nonly\\nconsistent offensive threat for the celtics, though he committed\\nsix\\nturnovers (four traveling). pierce (15 points) was 3 for 15 from\\nthe field\\nand 7 for 12 at the foul line.\\n\\n\"we didn\\'t have the right focus,\" celtic guard rajon rondo\\nsaid.\\n\"there\\'s no way we should ever get beat by that many points. it\\'s\\nall\\nfocus. they don\\'t press, they aren\\'t a press team, to where we\\nshould turn\\nthe ball over. they

off at 7:15 p.m., about 15 hours after the\\nceltics checked\\nin at their hotel.\\n\\n\"it was a combination of a lot of things,\" said pierce of the\\nteam\\'s\\nworst regular-season defeat since a

nicely.\"\\n\\nwith mike singletary verbally undressing one of his players in a\\npress\\nconference, and his behind-the-scenes undressing of himself to\\nmotivate his\\nteam, things in san francisco just became a whole lot more\\ninteresting.\\n\\ncan such a hold-nothing-back approach work in today\\'s nfl?\\n\\nthe 49ers are off this weekend, so there will be no immediate\\non-field\\nanswers. but in the opinion of one observer close to the scene,\\ninitial\\nreactions among players, coaches, and team employees to\\nsingletary\\'s rants\\nhave been mixed - some feel it was necessary, others feel he\\'s\\nbordering on\\nout of control.\\n\\nit started when singletary, in his first game as interim coach,\\ntold tight\\nend vernon davis to hit the showers during last sunday\\'s\\nembarrassing 34-13\\nloss to the seahawks. davis had been flagged for unnecessary\\nroughness, and\\nsingletary didn\\'t like his reaction as he arrived to the sideline.\\nso he\\ntold him to get lost, then gave him a public lashing when answering\\nquestions from reporters after the game.\\n\\nlater in the week, it was learned that singletary also used a\\nunique\\nmotivational technique to get his team\\'s attention at halftime,\\npulling\\ndown his pants. his point was that the 49ers were getting their\\nbutt kicked\\nand they should be embarrassed.\\n\\nto some older-generation fans, singletary is surely a breath of\\nfresh air,\\na blast from the past when no-nonsense coaches ruled with an iron\\nfist. but\\ncan that work today?\\n\\n\"this isn\\'t like some disney movie where you can keep screaming\\nat a team\\nfor days and they\\'ll come back and run through a brick wall for\\nyou,\" said\\nformer linebacker chad brown, who played in the nfl from 1993-2007.\\n\"i\\nthink it can work once or twice, not over the long term, but a lot\\ndepends\\non the makeup of the team. i\\'d imagine that would get old pretty\\nquick with\\nan older, veteran type of team.\"\\n\\nbrown pointed to giants coach tom coughlin as an example of an\\nultra-intense, discipline-minded coach who nearly lost his grip on\\nplayers\\nbefore loosening a bit, an old-school guy keeping an open mind to\\nnew-school methods.\\n\\nsingletary acknowledged last week that he\\'s from the old school,\\nhaving\\nplayed under fire-breathing mike ditka and aggressive-minded buddy\\nryan,\\nwho once punched a fellow assistant coach on the sideline.\\n\\nlongtime nfl coach dan reeves believes there\\'s still a place in\\nthe game\\nfor that type of approach, as long as it\\'s genuine.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think being extremely demonstrative is a bad thing, as\\nlong as\\nyou\\'re being yourself, because players, fans, and everyone else\\nwill pick\\nup a phony quicker than anything,\" said reeves. \"i believe\\nplayers want\\nto do the right things, they want to be disciplined, they want to\\nknow how\\nto win, and i think mike singletary can relate to players that\\nway.\"\\n\\nstill, reeves believes that type of approach was easier to adopt\\nin the\\n1980s, when singletary was in the midst of his hall of fame playing\\ncareer.\\n\\n\"the greatest motivator in that period of time was fear - the\\nfear that\\nyou\\'d lose your job - and that fear pushed you and made you the\\nbest you\\ncan possibly be,\" he said. \"a lot of that has been taken away by\\nguaranteed salaries and signing bonuses. it is human nature that if\\nyou\\nguarantee something, that person isn\\'t going to be as fearful. it\\ntakes an\\nunusual person to not be affected by that.\"\\n\\nformer ravens offensive lineman mike flynn, who grew up in\\nagawam and\\nplayed from 1997-2007, doubts that players will respond if\\nsingletary\\ncontinues with this approach.\\n\\n\"the biggest thing is that these guys are professionals,\" he\\nsaid, \"and\\nit sounds good in theory, and it might work in high school and\\ncollege, but\\nthese guys are men. it\\'s hard to disrespect them and treat them a\\ncertain\\nway, and then not have some kind of consequences.\\n\\n\"i know mike from baltimore and he definitely was an old-school\\nguy. he\\'s\\ngoing to be like that in san francisco. if it doesn\\'t work out\\nthere, he\\'s\\ngoing to be that way somewhere else.\\n\\n\"the key is, what kind of respect does he have from the guys?\\nif the guys\\nrespect him, and listen to him, and believe what he has to say,\\nthat will\\nbe fine and they\\'ll let it go. but if he\\'s a guy that\\'s yelling and\\nscreaming and nobody respects what he\\'s saying, it\\'s only going to\\nmake a\\nbad situation worse.\"\\n\\non the flip side, flynn took note that he hadn\\'t heard another\\n49ers player\\ndefend davis, which might be an indication that it\\'s been\\nwell-received ...\\nfor now.\\n\\n\"you may be able to turn around a few guys, get them going in\\nthe right\\ndirection, but eventually you have to change your tone and - not\\ngive in to\\nthe player, so to speak - but be more player-friendly and realize\\nyou\\'re\\ndealing with men,\" flynn said.\\n\\n\"screaming and hollering only motivates you so much.\"\\n\\nothers, such as former patriots corey dillon and artrell\\nhawkins, are\\nbuying in.\\n\\n\"i agree with mike 100 percent, and i think that approach can\\nwork\\ntoday,\" dillon said. \"when i came to new england, i had to put a\\nlot of\\nmy own personal stuff on hold and check my ego at the door to get\\non the\\nsame page with the head coach and organization. he\\'s no-b.s., and\\nthat\\nreminds me a lot of bill ((belichick)).\"\\n\\nadded hawkins, \"i think his style can be successful, because\\nhe\\'s not just\\na coach, he was a player on the highest level. so you consider the\\nsource.\\nevery coach can\\'t do it. mike singletary can.\"\\n\\ntoo expensive?\\n\\ntouching the bases\\n\\napropos of nothing: 1. are the pittsburgh

major\\nleague\\nsource.\\n\\nwheeling and dealing ...\\n\\nthe yankees have been very aggressive in calling teams to see\\nwho might be\\navailable. they called the astros about roy oswalt and

don\\'t be surprised if the phillies\\nget\\ninto it if peavy waives his no-trade ... the angels have made\\nsigning mark\\nteixeira their no. 1 priority and teixeira himself would love

18-12\\n(manning-brady) overture. it was the regular-season game of the\\nlast two\\ncenturies, the battle of unbeaten bands, the most hyped non-playoff\\ngame in\\nleague history. the nfl network devoted 36 hours of pregame\\ncoverage to\\npatriots-ponies on nov. 4, 2007. it was presented as the de facto\\nsuper\\nbowl. tom brady entered the game with 30 touchdown passes and two\\ninterceptions.\\n\\nthe patriots\\' 24-20 win lived up to the hype, part of new\\nengland\\'s\\ninexorable, undefeated march to glendale, ariz. it was the last\\npatriots-colts game played at the rca dome.\\n\\ntonight we have the bradyless patriots against the sub.-500\\ncolts in lucas\\noil (can boyd) stadium.\\n\\nsorry, it\\'s just not the same. like brady, rodney harrison, and\\nthose\\nunblemished records ... the thrill is gone. patriots-colts 2008 is\\nnot even\\nthe nfl game of the weekend - that distinction goes to\\ngiants-cowboys.\\n\\nstill, it is a game of considerable consequence, one that should\\nmake you\\nnervous if you root for the patriots.\\n\\nit\\'s fashionable this fall to dump on the downtrodden colts. in\\nthe\\nprevious three seasons, indianapolis started 7-0, 9-0, and 13-0.\\ngoing\\ninto their matchups against the patriots, they were 7-0 each of the\\nlast\\nthree years. the colts were defending super bowl champs when the\\npatriots\\nlast visited the hoosier state. now they are 3-4 and lame-duck\\ncoach tony\\ndungy has virtually conceded the afc south to the tennessee titans.\\n\\nthings haven\\'t been the same here since indianapolis was stunned\\nby the\\nsan diego chargers in the playoffs last winter, denying us a chance\\nto see\\nmanning back at gillette for another conference championship\\nshowdown.\\nfolks in indy were still getting over the playoff loss when manning\\nhad\\nsurgery on a staph-infected bursa in his left knee in july.\\nmanning\\'s\\nrecovery was slowed by a second procedure on the knee. he missed\\nall of\\ntraining camp.\\n\\npatriots fans gave little mind to details of manning\\'s woes\\nuntil brady\\nexperienced difficulties after his initial knee surgery oct. 6. now\\neven\\ncasual listeners of patriot infomercial radio are experts on\\nmethicillin-resistant staphylococcus and infectious disease\\ncontrol.\\n\\nbottom line: manning, who has never missed a game, is not the\\nsame player\\nand these are not the same colts. he has 10 touchdown passes and\\nnine\\ninterceptions (matt cassel has seven tds and six picks). manning\\'s\\nquarterback rating (79) is lower than cassel\\'s (84.6).\\n\\nindy\\'s surgical-strike quarterback doesn\\'t have as many weapons,\\nnor does\\nhe have enough time to get rid of the ball. his timing and rhythm\\nhave been\\nshort-circuited and he has been forced to play from behind all\\nseason. the\\ncolts could easily be 1-6. they haven\\'t been able to run the ball\\nand for\\nthe first four weeks of the season they couldn\\'t stop anybody\\'s\\nrunning\\ngame.\\n\\nbut they are still dangerous, they are desperate, and they are\\nat home -\\njust like the chargers were when bill belichick and his players\\ntoured\\ncalifornia last month.\\n\\nthe colts also are getting some players back from injury,\\nincluding\\nrunning back joseph addai and all-world safety bob sanders. it\\'s a\\ncombustible mix for a patriots team learning to live without brady,\\ndepleted in both backfields. even with a hoodied genius plugging\\nholes and\\ndevising schemes, it\\'s difficult to win without talent and\\nexperience at\\ncornerback and safety. especially against manning playing at home\\non a dry,\\nfast surface.\\n\\njake lamotta used to say, \"i fought sugar ray robinson so many\\ntimes,\\nit\\'s amazing i didn\\'t get diabetes.\" that pretty much sums up\\npatriots-colts. this will be the ninth meeting between the teams in\\nthe\\nlast six seasons. belichick, rarely given to humor or hyperbole,\\nsaid,\\n\"we have had so many games with them and so much history with this\\nteam,\\nthe scouting report looks like a phone book.\"\\n\\nlucas oil stadium is another new wrinkle. it\\'s massive. it makes\\nthe\\nadjacent rca dome look like a guard shack.\\n\\n\"i know it will be a dynamic atmosphere up there sunday night,\\na lot of\\nnoise, a lot of energy, a new stadium,\" said belichick. \"i am\\nsure it\\nwill be very challenging for us, and hopefully we will be prepared,\\nup for\\nit, and ready to go.\"\\n\\nthey will be ready.

(6-2) in second place in the competitive nfc east.\\n\\ntop rookie: matt ryan. the former boston college quarterback has\\nled the\\nsurprising falcons to a 4-3 record and looks like a star in the\\nmaking.\\n\\nbest free agent signing: michael turner. the backup to running\\nback\\nladainian tomlinson in san diego for four seasons, he has shined in\\na\\nstarring role with the falcons (665 yards, 6 tds).\\n\\nworst free agent signing: jerry porter. what has a three-year\\ncontract with\\n$10 million in bonuses/guarantees produced for the jaguars? one\\ncatch for\\n6 yards.\\n\\nbest unsung performance: titans offensive line. left tackle\\nmichael roos,\\nleft guard eugene amano, center kevin mawae, right guard jake\\nscott, and\\nright tackle david stewart have surrendered just two sacks all\\nseason to\\nlead the nfl\\'s only undefeated team.\\n\\nworst performance: j.t. o\\'sullivan. hyped after winning the\\nquarterback job\\nover former no. 1 overall pick alex smith in san francisco, he\\ntossed 11\\ninterceptions, was sacked 32 times, and fumbled 11 times (six lost)\\nbefore\\nbeing benched last week.\\n\\nbest innovation: dolphins offense. their use of the \"wildcat\"\\nformation,\\nwith running back ronnie brown at quarterback, sent ripples through\\nthe\\nnfl.\\n\\nmost surprising team: giants. they\\'ve sent a decisive message to\\nthose who\\nthought their super bowl win was a fluke.\\n\\nmost disappointing team: chargers. at 3-5, they are fortunate to\\nbe playing\\nin the weak afc west, so they still have time to turn

a 17-0 lead, and had the eagles looking\\nfor\\nanswers, but with a reasonable sense of confidence.\\n\\n\"coach ((bc defensive coordinator frank)) spaziani said 17\\npoints is a\\nscary lead,\" said middle linebacker and cocaptain mike mclaughlin,\\nwhose\\nthird-quarter interception set up bc\\'s first td, a 1-yard run by\\njosh haden\\nthat made it 17-7. \"the team did a great job ((of coming back)).\\nunfortunately, we came up little short.\"\\n\\nas has been the case throughout the season, the bc defense\\ncarried the\\nburden and sparked the comeback, which came with a flourish in the\\nfourth\\nquarter.\\n\\nthe eagles drew to within a field goal when justin jarvis\\nblocked a clemson\\npunt that was recovered by roderick rollins and returned 25 yards\\nfor a td,\\ncutting clemson\\'s lead to 17-14 with 10:36 remaining in the fourth\\nquarter.\\n\\nwhen bc safety wes davis intercepted a cullen harper pass on the\\ntigers\\'\\nfirst play from scrimmage after the blocked punt, the eagles had\\nthe ball\\nback. when quarterback chris crane (18 of 39, 116 yards, 1 td)\\nconnected\\nwith brandon robinson on a 15-yard scoring pass, the eagles had the\\nlead\\nfor the first time at 21-17 with 8:43 left.\\n\\nbut this time neither destiny nor luck was on the eagles\\' side.\\n\\nspiller returned the ensuing kickoff 64 yards to the bc 15. five\\nplays\\nlater, clemson scored on a 4-yard pass from harper to wide receiver\\naaron\\nkelly, and with the extra point, clemson was up, 24-21.\\n\\na year ago, quarterback matt ryan led bc to a dramatic comeback\\nat\\nclemson. now it was crane\\'s turn.\\n\\nwith 2:39 left in regulation, the 6-foot-5-inch senior took over\\nat his 30.\\n\\nthe words crane heard from bc coach jeff jagodzinski were\\nconflicting. be\\naggressive, but be careful. \"i had a conversation with the coach\\nright\\nbefore i went out there and he said, \\'don\\'t end the game previous\\nto fourth\\ndown,\"\\' said crane, who couldn\\'t get a first down on the first\\nthree plays\\nof the series. \"don\\'t have the game end on a first- or second-down\\ncall\\n((interception)).\"\\n\\nfaced with fourth and 4, crane was forced out of the pocket and\\nthrew a\\nsideline pass to fullback james mccluskey in front of the clemson\\nbench.\\nthe officials ruled, however, that mccluskey was out of bounds.\\n\\n\"we just came up short tonight,\" said jagodzinski. \"give\\ncredit to\\nclemson. i\\'m proud of my guys. we fought with everything we had.\"\\n\\ncoming up short is not good enough for a team that can\\'t afford\\nany more\\nlosses. now the eagles (5-3, 2-3) have another test saturday\\nagainst notre\\ndame, and then they hit the road for games against florida state\\nand

left\\nnortheastern with a\\n38-13 loss. some of it had to do with last week, when the wildcats\\'\\nshot at\\nstunning no. 1 james madison ended on a 35-yard hail mary in the\\nfinal\\nminute. and some of it had to do with northeastern\\'s record.\\n\\nthe huskies were 2-6 coming into yesterday\\'s game, according to\\ntalley,\\nonly because they played the toughest schedule in the colonial\\nathletic\\nconference.\\n\\n\"i have been here,\" talley said. \"i have had my heart broken\\nbefore\\nhere. so, i know what can happen in this stadium.\"\\n\\nseeing the huskies convert on fourth and 8 off a fake punt did\\nnothing to\\nease talley\\'s jitters.\\n\\nno. 7 villanova responded, putting up 20 points in a little more\\nthan 12\\nminutes. but before the wildcats could leave with their 20-14 win,\\nthe\\nhuskies made sure to leave talley\\'s nerves a mess.\\n\\n\"we were scared of them coming into the game,\" talley said.\\n\"it was a\\nbig concern for us. i thought it would be a nasty game. but i\\nthought in\\nthe end we would have enough to win. that\\'s what happened.\"\\n\\nafter converting the fake punt, the huskies (2-7, 1-4) got a\\n12-yard\\nhalfback option pass for a touchdown from alex broomfield to brian\\nmandeville that enabled them to stay within striking distance even\\nwhen\\nvillanova (6-2, 4-1) ran off 20 straight points.\\n\\nvillanova quarterback chris whitney threw for 161 yards on\\n11-of-16\\npassing, including a 54-yard missile to brandyn harvey that set up\\na 6-yard\\ntouchdown run by aaron ball (17 carries, 91 yards). it was the\\nlongest pass\\nplay the huskies have allowed all season.\\n\\nbut in the second half, nu found a way to rattle whitney. part\\nof it was\\ndefensive coordinator rapheal dowdye huddling with his players and\\ntelling\\nthem to do their job, and part of it was finally figuring out the\\npace of\\nvillanova\\'s option offense.\\n\\n\"it\\'s different,\" said huskies linebacker cornelius bunch.\\n\"game speed\\nis definitely different than practice speed.\"\\n\\nbunch studied whitney and realized that on that deep ball, as\\nsoon as\\nwhitney dropped back that he was looking 50 yards downfield.\\n\\n\"he doesn\\'t look off his receivers,\" bunch said.\\n\\nwhich explains the pass bunch picked off on the eighth play of\\nthe\\nwildcats\\' first possession of the second half, when whitney dropped\\nback\\nlooking for angelo babbaro.\\n\\n\"i was just watching his eyes,\" bunch said.\\n\\nanthony orio needed two passes to turn that 43-yard interception\\nreturn\\ninto a northeastern touchdown, hitting tony lott (five catches, 62\\nyards),\\nwho corkscrewed through defenders until he reached the pylon for a\\n20-yard\\nscore.\\n\\nthe wildcats had two chances to close the door, when joe marcoux\\nmissed a\\n38-yard field goal, and when whitney threw another interception,\\nthis time\\nto jocquez fears.\\n\\nit wasn\\'t until linebacker marquis kirkland picked off a pass\\nfrom orio (16\\nof 25, 158 yards, 1 td, 2 ints) intended for chris plum that\\nvillanova was\\nfinally safe. and when he ran into nu coach rocky hager after the\\ngame,\\ntalley told him as much.\\n\\n\"he felt like they were pretty lucky to come out of here with a\\nwin,\"\\nhager said.\\n\\n\"their offense scared us a little bit,\" talley said. \"they\\'ve\\nbeen\\nrunning so many different things and special plays, and when you\\'re\\n2-6, i\\nthink you\\'ll try a lot of different things. they do a lot of\\nthings. for\\nthem to be 2-7 right now is a shame. they\\'re an excellent team.\\nthey just\\nhave a rough, rough schedule.\"\\n\\nafter the game, you could measure hager\\'s frustration by the\\nnumber of\\ntimes he said \"cotton-picking,\" as in \"cotton-picking\" inches\\nfrom a\\nwin.\\n\\n\"we will get over the hump,\" he said. \"we\\'ll keep fighting\\nand\\ngrinding.\"\\n\\njulian benbow can be reached at jbenbow@globe.com.\\n\\ntwo days

conrad cochran waited in\\nline to\\ncast his very first vote for william l. dawson, a ground-breaking\\nafrican-american politician from the neighborhood who was running\\nfor\\ncongress. forty-five years later, cochran stood for more than an\\nhour to\\nvote for another exceptional politician who called the south side\\nhome:\\nharold washington, chicago\\'s first black mayor in 1983.\\n\\nnow, at age 89, cochran, can barely stand at all; the walker he\\nneeds to\\nget around has a built-in seat. on thursday, however, the retired\\npostal\\nworker was as excited as anyone inside bronzeville\\'s martin luther\\nking jr.\\ncommunity center to vote for barack obama, a transplanted son of\\nthe south\\nside. and it didn\\'t matter that he had to wait in a three-hour-long\\nline to\\ndo it.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve never seen nothing like this,\" said cochran, who,\\nbecause of his\\nage, was escorted to the head of the line by poll workers. \"it\\nmeans\\nchange\" that\\'s been long in coming, \"and now it\\'s finally\\nhappening,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe change cochran referred to isn\\'t from one administration to\\nanother,\\nor from one set of policies to another: it\\'s a deeper change that\\nhas\\nallowed chicago\\'s large african-american community - the incubator\\nof many\\nblack leaders - to become, for this moment at least, the center of\\nall\\namerican politics.\\n\\nobama ran for the us senate from chicago, and he still lives on\\nthe south\\nside.\\n\\nthe neighborhood has been home to some of the most significant\\nblack\\npolitical figures in american history, including dawson, a powerful\\ncongressman who served more than 30 years; civil rights activist\\njesse\\njackson, creator of the push-rainbow coalition and a two-time\\npresidential\\ncandidate; and carol moseley braun, who in 1996 became the first\\nblack\\nwoman to win election to the us senate.\\n\\n\"only harlem might have been stronger\" in producing black\\npolitical\\nleaders of national prominence, said michael dawson, a political\\nscience\\nprofessor at the university of chicago and a relative of dawson,\\nwho won\\nhis congressional seat in 1942. the city\\'s south side, michael\\ndawson said,\\n\"developed black politicians at a level no other state has seen.\"\\n\\nfor decades, chicago has occupied a unique place in\\nafrican-american\\nhistory, and a high number of nationally-known black entrepreneurs\\ngot\\ntheir start here, from ebony magazine founder john johnson to\\ntalk-show\\nicon oprah winfrey. black chicagoans such as jackson and nation of\\nislam\\nleader louis farrakhan, both with strong ties to the south side,\\nled\\nmovements that influenced the national agenda.\\n\\nthe political springboard that propelled obama\\'s astonishing\\nrise to the\\ndoorstep of the white house, however, was established on the south\\nside,\\ndecades before his birth in hawaii.\\n\\nhistorians note that, beginning in the early 1900s, that area of\\nchicago\\nbecame a destination for hundreds of thousands of former slaves and\\ntheir\\ndescendants who moved to the midwest, fleeing jim crow oppression\\nand the\\ngrinding, hand-to-mouth poverty of the postwar south. lured by the\\nprospect\\nof good jobs and a more tolerant racial climate, many of them\\nboarded\\ntrains, hitched rides, or traveled however they could, following a\\nnorthbound path that traced the mississippi river.\\n\\nstephanie davenport, director of educational programs at\\nchicago\\'s\\ndusable museum of african american history, said the migrants found\\nracial\\nhostility and segregation along with jobs in chicago\\'s factories\\nand\\nfoundries. most of the migrants, she said, didn\\'t have much money\\nand\\nsettled on the south side, which had plenty of cheap, substandard\\nhousing.\\n\\nbut the hard times helped forge a strong sense of community and\\nself-sufficiency, she said; segregation gave rise to the city\\'s\\nfirst\\nafrican-american doctors, dentists, and attorneys, which in turn\\nhelped\\ncreate the city\\'s upwardly-mobile black middle class. as community\\nleaders\\nbegan to demand better working and living conditions, davenport\\nsaid,\\n\"that meant you had to go against the political system\" and learn\\nhow it\\nworked.\\n\\ngradually, south side businesspeople, community activists, and\\naspiring\\npoliticians began to realize their collective power. white\\npoliticians\\n\"could see that there were lots of votes here,\" inspiring\\ntrans-racial\\ncoalitions, davenport said. \"you had all of this coming\\ntogether,\" she\\nsaid. \"and it found a home on the south side.\"\\n\\ntoni preckwinkle, a longtime alderman who represents the hyde\\npark\\nneighborhood in the south side, said the area has \"always had an\\ninteresting relationship with national politics,\" starting with\\narthur\\nmitchell, who was elected to congress in the 1930s. dawson, she\\nsaid, was\\nwidely regarded as a kingmaker for judges and up-and-coming\\npoliticians -\\nblack and white - during his tenure on capitol hill, \"the person\\ndemocrats\\nlooked to for recommendations.\"\\n\\nthe south side \"has produced the preeminent african-american\\npoliticians\\nin the country,\" said preckwinkle, who was an early mentor to\\nobama when\\nhe moved to the area as a community organizer in the 1990s.\\n\\ndavid axelrod, obama\\'s chief political strategist and a former\\nchicago\\ntribune political writer, was working for the newspaper when\\nwashington ran\\nfor mayor in \"a very, very ugly election\" that broke sharply\\nalong racial\\nlines. but obama carried nearly all of the city during the illinois\\nprimary\\n- including the ones washington lost. though it remains to be seen\\nwhether\\nother young, aspiring black politicians follow obama\\'s model and\\ncome to\\nthe south side to establish themselves, the signs for the future\\nare good,\\nhe said.\\n\\n\"we already elected two african-american united states\\nsenators. we\\'ve\\nmade tremendous progress in illinois in breaking down some of these\\nold\\nbarriers,\" said axelrod, pausing between campaign events in\\nflorida during\\nthe last week of the presidential race.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know if it makes it the hub of black politics.\\nhopefully, if we\\nare successful - and even if we\\'re not - at this point it\\'s fair to\\nsay\\nthat obama has helped shatter some old shibboleths and myths and\\nbarriers,\\nand i think that will be important,\" he said.\\n\\n\"but he\\'s not running to be the leader of the black\\ncommunity,\" axelrod\\nsaid. \"he\\'s running to be president of the united states.\"\\n\\nscott helman of the globe staff , who is traveling with the\\nobama campaign,\\ncontributed to this report.\\n\\nwhile barack obama enters the final days of the presidential\\ncampaign with\\na clear lead in the polls - but not so big as to rule out a\\nsurprise\\nvictory for john mccain - the impact of the 2008 presidential\\ncampaign will\\ndepend not only on who wins but also on whether the results signify\\na\\ndeeper realignment in american politics.\\n\\n\"we like to tell the election story through the candidates,\"\\nsaid thomas\\npatterson, a professor at harvard\\'s john f. kennedy school of\\ngovernment.\\n\"but this time there are larger forces in play.\"\\n\\nand while obama\\'s lead, between three and seven percentage\\npoints in most\\nnational polls, is big enough to make him the favorite going into\\ntuesday,\\nthe other big questions of the election are all too close to call.\\n\\nis the \"reagan revolution\" over? going down the stretch,\\nmccain is\\ncampaigning heavily on obama\\'s comment that he wants to \"spread\\nthe\\nwealth.\" and mccain has even discovered a seven-year-old radio\\ninterview\\nsuggesting that obama may believe in \"redistributive\" economics.\\n\\nduring the heyday of the democrats\\' new deal coalition, which\\ndominated\\npolitics from 1932 until 1980, the idea of spreading the wealth\\naround was\\nhardly political poison - it was the backbone of the party\\'s\\neconomic\\nphilosophy. since 1980 and the \"reagan revolution,\" however,\\nusing tax\\npolicies to redistribute income has been widely viewed as an\\noutmoded\\napproach that chokes off economic growth.\\n\\nobama hasn\\'t fully embraced \\'60s-style tax-and-spend liberalism,\\nbut he\\nhasn\\'t run away from it as much as other democratic presidential\\nnominees\\nsince 1984 have done. bill clinton, the most successful democratic\\nvote-getter of that period, went out of his way to declare that\\n\"the era\\nof big government is over,\" and assure voters that he is a\\n\"pro-growth\"\\ndemocrat who favors \"third way\" policies.\\n\\nobama also touts his policies as pro-growth, but has emphasized\\nthat he\\nbelieves people earning more than $250,000 should bear the brunt of\\ntax\\nincreases to cover social initiatives that would disproportionately\\nbenefit\\nlower-income people. to the extent that such a mechanism \"spreads\\nthe\\nwealth,\" he\\'s in favor of it.\\n\\nmany observers have noted that americans want more economic\\nsecurity in\\ntheir lives, including guaranteed healthcare, pensions, disaster\\nrelief,\\nand improvements to public infrastructure. and the mccain campaign,\\nin a\\nbreak with ronald reagan\\'s creed of smaller government, has called\\nfor the\\ngovernment to pay up to $300 billion to buy up home mortgages and\\nchop the\\nmonthly payments to reflect diminished home values.\\n\\nin addition, the mccain proposal that follows the reagan creed\\nmost closely\\n- his call for extending the bush tax cuts and adding new cuts of\\nbusiness\\ntaxes - seems to be falling on deaf ears; in recent weeks, the gop\\nnominee\\nhas concentrated more on warning of tax hikes under obama than\\ntouting the\\nbenefits of his own tax-cut plan.\\n\\ndavid brooks, the conservative new york times columnist, has\\npredicted that\\nthe economic uncertainty will lead to a democratic sweep followed\\nby an\\nintensive return to tax-and-spend liberalism. \"what we\\'re going to\\nsee, in\\nshort, is the gingrich revolution in reverse and on steroids,\"\\nbrooks\\nwrote last month.\\n\\nmccain believes that voters still fear the kind of overreach\\nthat brooks\\npredicts. a modest victory for obama could easily be ascribed to a\\nsimple\\ndesire for a change, benefiting a candidate who tried to present\\nhis\\npolicies in modest terms.\\n\\na big obama win, however, could be read as a mandate for just\\nthe kind of\\nliberalism that brooks fears. and it could signal a much\\nlonger-term\\npolitical realignment. the new deal era and the reagan revolution\\neach\\nfollowed failed presidencies that, fairly or not, are still invoked\\nas\\ncautionary tales - the herbert hoover and jimmy carter\\nadministrations.\\ngeorge w. bush\\'s administration, with record-low approval ratings,\\nmay join\\nthe list.\\n\\nis america prepared to move beyond its racial divisions? on the\\nday of\\nobama\\'s democratic nomination acceptance speech, tens of thousands\\nof\\nafrican-americans, most with children in tow, waited for hours in\\nsecurity\\nlines to enter denver\\'s football stadium to celebrate the crowning\\nof the\\nnation\\'s first black presidential nominee.\\n\\ndespite the football setting, it was more of a church crowd -\\nuplifted,\\ngenerous, and full of faith. while some black voters would express\\nconcerns\\nfor obama\\'s safety and nervousness about his campaign, many others\\nhave\\nremained quietly confident, even when polls narrowed and other\\ndemocrats\\nworried that obama wasn\\'t as far ahead as he should be, given the\\ncountry\\'s\\nproblems.\\n\\nmuch of black voters\\' faith is in obama himself. but there is\\nalso a quiet\\nrecognition among many that, whatever the extent of racial\\ndivisions, they\\ndon\\'t preclude a majority-white country from electing a black\\npresident.\\n\\nthat by itself could change racial pathologies that have existed\\nthroughout\\namerican history.\\n\\nsince george washington, the president has been the symbol of\\nthe nation,\\nas much as european monarchs once embodied their nations\\' identity.\\nhaving\\na black president just four decades after the end of legal\\nsegregation\\nwould force a reconsideration of almost all assumptions about race\\nrelations in america.\\n\\nbut if obama were to lose - and if white resistance to a black\\nnominee were\\ncited as a major factor - black hopes would be dashed in a way that\\ncould\\nincrease racial tensions, at least in the short term.\\n\\nstill, the legacy of the obama campaign, win or lose, on race\\nrelations\\nprobably won\\'t be clear until long after tuesday.\\n\\nare young people becoming a driving force in american politics?\\nback in the\\n\\'60s, the emerging baby boom generation pushed american politics\\nleftward.\\nbut through the \\'80s and \\'90s, voters under 30 see-sawed between\\nbacking\\ndemocrats and republicans, while turning out in smaller numbers\\noverall.\\ntheir strongest sentiment seemed to be their indifference.\\n\\nin the 2000 race between al gore and george w. bush, only 40\\npercent of\\nregistered voters from ages 18 to 29 bothered to vote, compared\\nwith 65\\npercent of voters over 30, according to a survey by the nonpartisan\\npew\\nresearch center.\\n\\nin 2004, the turnout of voters under 30 jumped by nine\\npercentage points,\\nto 49 percent, while that of older voters increased by only three.\\nand\\nthose younger voters supported democrat john kerry over bush by a\\nseven-point margin, 48 to 41 percent.\\n\\nthis year, voters between 18 and 29 are backing obama by a\\nwhopping 29\\npoints - 61 to 32, according to a pew survey. and while more young\\nvoters\\nshowed up for this year\\'s democratic primaries than in 2004, no one\\nis sure\\nwhether turnout of young voters will take another big leap in the\\ngeneral\\nelection.\\n\\n\"we\\'re expecting them to at least match their turnout level of\\n2004, if\\nnot increase it,\" said scott keeter, pew\\'s director of survey\\nresearch.\\n\"given the enormous lead obama has among young voters, they\\'ll be\\na key to\\nwhether he wins or not.\"\\n\\nhow much do americans care about their image in the world?\\narguably, the\\nopinions of foreigners have never counted for anything in us\\npolitics. some\\nof the most unpopular american presidents in the outside world -\\nsuch as\\nreagan - were hugely popular at home, while those most concerned\\nwith the\\nworld - like hoover and carter - were domestic flops.\\n\\nbut the latest plunge in america\\'s standing in the world,\\nspurred by the\\npolicies of the bush administration, has gotten some political\\nattention at\\nhome, especially when linked to the administration\\'s failure to\\npersuade\\nenough allies to share the costs of intervention in iraq.\\n\\nobama has cited his own racial background and time spent in\\nindonesia as a\\nreason why \"the world will look at america differently when i\\'m\\npresident.\"\\n\\nthat argument drew voters to obama during his primary race\\nagainst hillary\\nclinton. and he reinforced just how much his election could do to\\nimprove\\nrelations with us allies by staging a campaign-style rally in\\nberlin,\\nattended by hundreds of thousands of adoring germans.\\n\\nelsewhere in the world, from europe to asia, there has been\\nintense\\nscrutiny of the american election - and excitement over the obama\\ncampaign.\\nthe global interest suggests that millions of foreigners might be\\nprepared\\nto change their opinions of the united states under a president\\nobama.\\n\\nbut in recent weeks, foreign policy has taken a back seat in the\\nelection,\\nso it will be hard to judge how much an obama victory would be a\\nmandate to\\nbe more attentive to us allies. and it remains to be seen whether a\\npresident obama would be able to meet the high expectations that\\namerican\\nallies seem to have for him.\\n\\nwhat does it mean to be a conservative? the republican coalition\\nhas been\\ncompared to a stool with three legs - strong national defense, low\\ntaxes,\\nand conservative social values. it\\'s never been a secret that many\\nrepublicans buy into only one or another of the three legs, but\\nthey\\'ve\\nbought in strongly enough that their disagreements with the others\\nhaven\\'t\\nmattered. recently, though, the stool has been wobbling.\\n\\nback in easter of 2005, the president and both houses of\\ncongress rushed\\nback to washington to intervene in the case of terri schiavo, a\\nbrain-damaged woman whose husband had chosen to remove her from a\\nrespirator. polls showed vast majorities of americans opposed to\\ngovernment\\nintervention, but bush and gop congressional leaders pushed\\nlegislation\\nthrough anyway.\\n\\nthat weekend was a triumph for abortion foes, but may have\\ndriven other\\nrepublicans away. likewise, the unexpected toll in iraq has sparked\\nconcerns among evangelicals, and the recent wall street meltdown\\nhas made\\nmany middle-class republicans question their party\\'s economic\\npolicies.\\n\\nmccain is mostly aligned with the defense wing, but also has\\ncredibility as\\na budget cutter. he has tried to hold together all three\\nconservative\\nconstituencies, even wooing social conservatives - who have long\\nresisted\\nhim - with his pick of alaska governor sarah palin as his vice\\npresidential\\nnominee.\\n\\nstill, his presidency, compared with bush\\'s, would probably\\nreduce the\\nimpact of the religious right. and if mccain is defeated, the three\\nbranches of the gop will have to decide whether to hang together -\\nor go\\ntheir own ways.\\n\\n\"they may choose to dampen down the role of social\\nconservatives, a bit\\nlike the democrats after the \\'80s really pushed down as much as\\nthey could\\non the african-american agenda,\" says patterson. but in the short\\nterm, he\\nsaid, much will depend on events outside the party\\'s control, like\\nthe\\neconomy.\\n\\n\"if the economy\\'s weak, they\\'ll gain seats in congress in two\\nyears,\"\\nassuming that democrats, as expected, maintain control of the house\\nand the\\nsenate, patterson said. \"they\\'ll declare that the party\\'s back.\"\\n\\nbut in what form will remain to be seen.\\n\\ndianne wilkerson\\'s star crashed just as barack obama\\'s soars.\\n\\nfor boston\\'s black community, the anticipated sweetness of an\\nobama victory\\nis soured by the scandal engulfing wilkerson, the only\\nafrican-american\\nmember of the massachusetts senate.\\n\\nmany longtime enablers, black and white, finally cut wilkerson\\nloose,\\nfollowing allegations that she accepted bribes worth $23,500 in an\\nfbi\\nundercover operation. surveillance photos show her not just taking\\ncash,\\nbut stuffing it under her shirt into her bra.\\n\\nfor years, colleagues looked the other way as wilkerson broke\\nfederal tax\\nand campaign finance laws. but last week, the senate passed a\\nresolution\\ncalling on her to resign. this time, there was no presumption of\\ninnocence;\\njust anger that she dragged political friends into what she calls\\n\"the\\nmadness that has become my life.\" senate president therese murray\\nand\\nboston mayor thomas menino, among others, have been summoned before\\na\\nfederal grand jury in connection with wilkerson\\'s effort to secure\\na liquor\\nlicense for a roxbury club.\\n\\nwhen the scandal first broke, wilkerson vowed to continue a\\nwrite-in\\ncampaign to save the seat she held for 15 years. she hoped that\\nblack\\nvoters who turned out for obama would also help sweep her to\\nvictory.\\n\\nbut then a group of boston\\'s black clergy also called upon\\nwilkerson to\\nstep down. when a black politician loses the support of local black\\nministers, it\\'s over. on friday, wilkerson suspended her write-in\\ncampaign\\nand said she will not seek reelection. she did not resign, but said\\nshe\\nwill make another announcement on nov. 5, the day after the\\nelection.\\n\\non one level, wilkerson\\'s humiliating fall is small-time and\\nstrictly\\nlocal. but because of obama\\'s remarkable journey, it is part of a\\nbigger\\nstory, a generational transition in black leadership that is\\nsweeping the\\ncountry.\\n\\nas nov. 4 draws near, the election of the country\\'s first\\nafrican-american\\npresident is starting to feel imminent. as the possibility grows,\\nafrican-americans are starting to feel quietly jubilant.\\n\\ndarnell l. williams, president of the urban league of eastern\\nmassachusetts, passed along an e-mail that was recently forwarded\\nto him:\\n\"rosa sat so that martin could walk. martin walked so that barack\\ncould\\nrun. barack runs so that our children could fly.\"\\n\\nthose references to rosa parks, who refused to sit in the back\\nof a bus in\\nmontgomery, ala., and to martin luther king jr., who famously\\nmarched to\\nthe nation\\'s capitol, speak to years of fighting for civil rights\\nand a\\nmovement that could culminate with obama in the oval office.\\n\\nbut, suddenly in boston, the headiness of watching obama\\'s\\nstunning success\\non the national stage ran up against the unpleasant pettiness of\\nwilkerson\\'s alleged corruption. her response to the charges didn\\'t\\nhelp.\\n\\nfaced with damning photographs that allegedly catch her in the\\nact of being\\nbribed, wilkerson complained that the federal investigation was\\npolitically\\nmotivated. some loyal supporters also cast her as the victim of a\\nwhite\\npolitical establishment eager to bring her down.\\n\\nthat kind of talk does not mesh with the style and rhetoric\\nobama embraced\\nin his historic run for the presidency.\\n\\n\"obama has presented a compelling case for change, and ability\\nto unify\\nand not divide along racial and gender lines,\" said williams, of\\nthe urban\\n\\nleague. \"we have to recognize that part of that change will not\\ninclude\\nactivities and behaviors that are attached to the past.\"\\n\\nto kevin peterson, who heads the ella j. baker house in\\ndorchester,\\nwilkerson represents \"a different style of a different generation,\\nwhich\\nmay be archaic in terms of leadership in the black community.\"\\nafter\\nobama, he said, \"the notion that black people need to employ\\nracially\\npolarizing stances is extinct.\"\\n\\nto coin the candidate\\'s phrase - as the fierce urgency of now\\npropels\\nobama closer to the white house, it squeezes wilkerson out of the\\nmassachusetts state house. once she was the reformer and symbol of\\na new\\ngeneration of black leadership. but she squandered her platform and\\npower,\\njust as obama maximized his.\\n\\nthe

him\\nthink of hippies. he does not like the idea of raising taxes on the\\nrich,\\neither - it\\'s not fair, he believes, \"to take money somebody has\\nworked\\nfor and give it to somebody else who doesn\\'t work.\"\\n\\nbut as he looked out over the dimly lit restaurant he owns in\\nthis\\nonce-thriving steel town, he said he liked barack obama\\'s proposal\\nfor a\\nmiddle-class tax cut. the point used to fill with workers from the\\nnearby\\nasphalt and concrete plants. now, work has slowed, money is tight,\\nand the\\nbar is near-empty some days.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t believe obama\\'s a socialist,\" said hrelec, a\\n58-year-old\\ndemocrat who voted for george w. bush twice, and who is undecided\\nthis\\nyear. \"the working guy in this country needs a break.\"\\n\\nin the final days of the presidential race, john mccain is\\nforcefully\\narguing that obama is a liberal tax-and-spender - even a marxist,\\nhe says,\\nquoting the illinois senator\\'s remark to joe the plumber that he\\nwanted to\\n\"spread the wealth around.\" in beaver county, pa., a swing\\ndistrict\\nnorthwest of pittsburgh teeming with reagan democrats, mccain\\'s\\nargument\\nresonates - but perhaps, in this economy, not as strongly as he\\nwould like.\\n\\nin the towns along the hilly banks of the ohio river, where\\nmorning\\nsunshine cast a milky light on the late foliage last week,\\ncommunities are\\nstill struggling to reinvent themselves a generation after the\\ncollapse of\\nthe steel industry here. voters tend to be right-leaning on social\\nissues\\nand uncomfortable with the idea of increasing taxes on anybody,\\neven the\\nwealthy. but they also remember the days when their towns had a\\nstronger\\nmiddle class, when good jobs were plentiful, and it wasn\\'t hard for\\na\\nsteelworker with a high school education to own a nice house and a\\nsecond\\ncar.\\n\\nsuch jobs are much harder to find now in rochester; in the last\\nyear a\\nsluggish economy has hurt businesses and slowed construction, and\\nthe cost\\nof everything has gone up, said joe kaminsky, a 38-year-old\\nself-employed\\ncontractor from nearby monaca, who remembers the days when his\\nfather could\\nwalk out of one steel mill and find another job at the next mill\\ndown the\\nstreet. standing downtown the other day, surrounded by abandoned\\nstorefronts filled with old junk, kaminsky was on his way to the\\nsalvation\\narmy to see about getting some assistance during the holidays for\\nhis\\nfamily of seven.\\n\\nthe way voters like kaminsky see it, wealth has already flowed\\naway from\\nthe poor and the middle class toward the rich, and some corrective\\naction\\nis in order.\\n\\n\"i think people are fed up with the republican point of view -\\nthe rich\\nget the breaks and we get the shaft,\" said kaminsky, a democrat\\nwho\\nsupports obama.\\n\\neven some hard-core republicans who planned to vote for mccain\\ndismissed\\nhis argument that obama is a socialist, pointing out that many\\nrepublicans\\nvoted for the $700 billion bailout package.\\n\\n\"you want to talk about socialism, look who\\'s owning the\\nbanks,\" said dan\\nrainey, a 60-year-old republican who works at a sports memorabilia\\nstore in\\nbeaver, the thriving and picturesque county seat. he once believed\\nin\\ntrickle-down economics. when ronald reagan was president it seemed\\nto work,\\nhe said. but a bank president \"wasn\\'t making $25 million back\\nthen,\\neither.\"\\n\\nstill, there remains a deep distrust of big government programs\\nhere, and\\nstrong skepticism about obama. a number of voters feared he would\\ntransfer\\nwealth from the middle class to help people \"who don\\'t work\" or\\nwho don\\'t\\ndeserve it.\\n\\n\"for me to pay for someone to have insurance who could pay for\\nit\\nthemselves, i\\'m not into that,\" said debby jurich, a 47-year-old\\nstay-at-home mother from beaver. \"i don\\'t think government should\\npay for\\neverything.\"\\n\\npennsylvania\\'s 21 electoral votes are critical to mccain\\'s\\nchances of\\nwinning the presidency. though he is behind in the polls, he hopes\\nto pull\\nan upset by picking up conservative democrats in swing counties\\nlike\\nbeaver, which only narrowly went for john kerry in 2004.\\n\\nmccain\\'s focus on casting obama as the wealth \"redistributor in\\nchief\" is\\nhard to miss around here these days. in coffee shops and\\nconvenience\\nstores, republican radio ads repeatedly warn that \"congressional\\nliberals\" want to raise taxes and increase spending by $1\\ntrillion. \"they\\ncall it taxing the rich; we call it out of touch with our values,\"\\nthe\\nnarrator says.\\n\\nchris borick, a political science professor and director of\\nmuhlenberg\\ncollege\\'s institute of public opinion in allentown, said his\\ntracking\\npolls for the morning call newspaper of allentown suggest that so\\nfar,\\nmccain\\'s argument is not working - voters believe mccain would help\\nthe\\nrich while obama would help the middle class.\\n\\nthe concept of wealth redistribution is as unpopular here as it\\nis in most\\nof america, borick said, and the notion may play on racist fears of\\nblack\\nwelfare recipients siphoning money from working-class whites -\\nfears that\\nhave special resonance since obama is black.\\n\\nbut \"when your biggest concern is your immediate financial\\nwell-being ...\\nyou\\'re not so much worried about what\\'s going to happen on the\\nmargin,\" he\\nsaid. \"you\\'re more worried about the big picture.\"\\n\\nyet this does not mean, he said, that western pennsylvanians\\nwould be\\ncomfortable with a democratic party that fully embraced\\nold-fashioned\\nliberal ideals. voters like hrelec, the restaurant owner, continue\\nto\\ndescribe themselves as moderate to conservative and prefer a\\ncentrist\\ngovernment.\\n\\n\"i would like to see the democratic party be more along lines\\nof when jfk\\nwas president,\" hrelec said. \"he wasn\\'t so far to the left. he\\ntried to\\nhelp the working people in this country, but he didn\\'t punish the\\nrich\\npeople, either.\"\\n\\nto be sure, there are voters here for whom principle trumps\\neconomic\\nself-interest - people who would pay lower taxes under obama than\\nmccain,\\nbut prefer the republicans\\' tax policy on the grounds that wealth\\nredistribution is anti-american. doug blaker, a contractor in his\\nlate 40s,\\nwas handing out candy to trick-or-treaters the other night outside\\nthe\\npolish falcons hall in ambridge, an ailing former steel town.\\n\\n\"people who came to this country came for a free life,\" said\\nblaker, a\\ndemocrat who is backing mccain. \"if you start taking away some of\\nthat\\nfreedom, what good is it anymore?\"\\n\\nhis friend, tom patrician, a 55-year-old republican and\\npresident of the\\nlocal chamber of commerce who now as an independent contractor\\nearns a\\nfraction of what he once made at a union airline job - said a few\\nthousand\\ndollars wouldn\\'t do him much good anyway. he prefers mccain\\'s\\nexperience to\\nobama\\'s.\\n\\nbut in an economy like this one, the success of mccain\\'s\\nargument may hinge\\nless on ideology, and more on whether he can convince voters that\\nobama\\'s\\nreal purpose - as the gop radio ad implies - is to transfer wealth\\nfrom the\\nmiddle class to the poor, rather than from the rich to everyone\\nelse.\\n\\nkathy lucci, a 48-year-old saleswoman at a jewelry store in\\ndowntown\\nrochester, voted for bill clinton and al gore, but she plans to\\nback mccain\\non tuesday. she and her husband work hard, she said, and they give\\ngenerously to the st. jude society, the veterans of foreign

a food voucher to buy steak.\\n\\n\"when he\\'s talking to people about spreading the wealth,\" she\\nsaid of\\nobama, \"i don\\'t think he\\'s talking to the middle class.\"\\n\\nhrelec disagrees. and as he sat in his quiet restaurant the\\nother day, he\\nseemed much more inclined to support obama because of his\\nmiddle-class tax\\ncuts than to spurn him because of his tax hikes for the rich. \"i\\nbelieve\\nthey spend more on corporate welfare and bailing bankers out than\\nthey give\\nto the needy people in this country,\" he said.\\n\\nthe detroit news plans to move the following

time between the end of the age of the founding fathers and\\nthe beginning of the civil war era was for a long time something of\\na historical black hole for many americans. the presidents in this\\nperiod, with one notable exception, are barely remembered today for\\nanything other than having been president. politics often revolved\\naround now obscure issues like the tariff, the second bank of the\\nunited states and \"internal improvements.\"\\n\\nwell, the emptiness has been filled. in 2005 the princeton\\nhistorian sean wilentz published \"the rise of american\\ndemocracy,\" covering at great length (1,044 pages) the 19th\\ncentury up to the civil war. last year saw the publication of\\ndaniel walker howe\\'s \"what hath god wrought: the transformation of\\namerica, 1815-1848,\" which won the pulitzer prize. it too is no\\nairplane read, coming in at 904 pages, but he covers the period\\nextremely well.\\n\\nand now david s. reynolds, distinguished professor at the\\ngraduate center of the city university of new york and winner of\\nthe bancroft prize for his book \"walt whitman\\'s america,\" offers\\nhis take in \"waking giant: america in the age of jackson\" at a\\nmere 466 pages. that length is in many ways a virtue, and not just\\nfor people who like to read in bed and breathe at the same time.\\n\\nthis period saw a remarkable transformation. there were only 18\\nstates in 1815 but 30 by 1848. florida, texas and vast stretches of\\nthe northwest and southwest were added to the national territory.\\nthe population of the united states increased to nearly 23 million\\nfrom 8 million. and that population became much more diverse as\\nimmigrants began to pour in from europe and spread out across the\\ncontinent with increasing speed.\\n\\namericans were a remarkably bumptious, self-confident, ambitious\\nand materialistic group. the englishwoman frances trollope (mother\\nof the novelist anthony trollope) reported a resident englishman\\ntelling her that \"he had never overheard americans conversing\\nwithout the word \"dollar\" being pronounced between them.\" and\\nyet the country was also in the midst of a major religious revival,\\noften called the second great awakening. this was the period when\\njoseph smith was founding the mormons and william miller the\\nadventists, when revival meetings were sometimes attended by tens\\nof thousands.\\n\\neconomically the country became much richer and much more\\ndiverse as industry developed in the north, cotton spread through\\nthe lower south, and the midwest turned into one of the world\\'s\\ngreat grain-producing areas. transportation improved radically as\\nroads, canals and then, after 1830, railroads began to connect the\\nvarious parts of an immense country and to weld it into a single,\\ncontinent-wide market.\\n\\nthe erie canal was by far the most important of these new\\navenues, for it linked the fertile soils of the midwest directly to\\nthe east coast. the produce that once had to flow down the\\nmississippi began increasingly to flow through the canal to new\\nyork city, which became the greatest boom town the world had ever\\nknown.\\n\\ncuriously, three men who never became president (although they\\nwanted the office) -- henry clay, daniel webster and john c. calhoun\\n-- are more familiar to most americans than many of the men who did\\nreach the white house. but one president dominated the era to the\\nextent that he gave his name to the age and received the ultimate\\nhistorical accolade of having that name turned into an adjective to\\ndescribe his times and policies.\\n\\nthat, of course, was andrew jackson. he was the first president\\nto be born poor, the first not to come from virginia or\\nmassachusetts. he shaped the future of american politics so\\nprofoundly that the great 19th-century historian george bancroft\\nthought him the last of the founding fathers. it was in jackson\\'s\\ntime that property qualifications for voting were largely abolished\\nand what we would recognize as democracy (at least for white men)\\ntook firm hold. the modern two-party system evolved in this period\\nas well, as jackson became the father of the present-day democratic\\nparty. and in the 1850s the anti-jackson whigs would give way to\\nthe republicans.\\n\\nreynolds brings this remarkable man to life. after an attempted\\nassassination misfired, reynolds reports: \"jackson once said he\\nnever felt frightened in any situation, and he certainly was not\\nnow. he lifted his cane and charged his assailant. dropping the\\npistol, the man pulled out another, aimed and fired. again the gun\\nfailed. others wrestled the gunman to the ground. jackson calmly\\ncontinued his day, remarking that he \\'was not born to be shot by\\nan assassin.\"\\'\\n\\nreynolds\\' book is, necessarily, a tour d\\'horizon of the period.\\nand he describes it thoroughly in a manageable amount of space.\\ngiven the vast size of the subject, the number of people to be\\ndiscussed and the number of topics to be covered to give a sense of\\nthis period, that is no small accomplishment.\\n\\nto achieve his goal, reynolds deviates from a strictly\\nchronological approach. instead he covers many major subjects, like\\nthe religious revival, separately. he has a chapter on the literary\\nand artistic accomplishments of the time, when the country began\\nforging a separate identity in the arts. edgar allan poe, ralph\\nwaldo emerson, nathaniel hawthorne, james fenimore cooper and\\nothers gave america a distinct literary voice. artists like thomas\\ncole, asher b. durand, george catlin and william sydney mount\\npainted american subjects in new ways rather than copying european\\nstyles.\\n\\nthere\\'s a chapter on inventions that even covers fads.\\nmccormick\\'s reaper would revolutionize agriculture; morse\\'s\\ntelegraph speeded up communications by orders of magnitude; colt\\'s\\npistol changed manufacturing profoundly. spiritualism and\\nphrenology arose, as did dietary nostrums like those promoted by\\nsylvester graham (who, at least, left the graham cracker as a\\nlasting legacy of his nutty ideas on nutrition).\\n\\nreynolds covers so much with such economy that you sometimes get\\nthe feeling the book was written on index cards. but \"waking\\ngiant\" is, in whole, a terrific introduction of succinct length to\\na period in our history that was once ignored, a period\\nincreasingly recognized as a time when the foundations of much of\\nmodern america were laid.\\n\\npublication notes:\\n      \\'waking giant\\n      america in the age of jackson\\'\\n      by david s. reynolds\\n      illustrated. 466 pages. harper/harpercollins. $29.95\\n\\njanet jackson has had a rough year. her current\\nalbum, \"discipline,\" arrived in february to such disappointing\\nsales that in september, with fewer than a half-million copies\\nsold, she ended her contract with the label, island def jam,\\nleaving her independent. so there was an extra edge during her\\nmadison square garden show on saturday when she shouted, at the end\\nof her song \"control\": \"i\\'m on my own, and i\\'ll call my own\\nshots!\"\\n\\nher first tour in seven years started shakily this fall, with\\nshows suddenly canceled or postponed. her spokesman said that\\njackson, 42, suffered from vestibular migraines that could cause\\ndizziness -- a problem for a performer who, in concert, is more a\\ndancer than a singer. the tour\\'s original opening act, ll cool j,\\ndropped off the bill.\\n\\nyet none of that weighed down jackson\\'s garden show, which had\\nbeen postponed from oct. 16. she strutted through a full-tilt arena\\nspectacle like those she has mounted since her multimillion-selling\\ndays in the 1980s and \\'90s, with dancers, video screens,\\npyrotechnics and lip-synching. (how much jackson was actually\\nsinging during the concert is open to conjecture. except for stage\\npatter, her voice was rarely fully exposed as she shared lead\\nvocals with recorded tracks.) but the foundation for all that\\nrazzle-dazzle was one of the most durable catalogs of hits from the\\nmusic-video era, and plenty of them. jackson\\'s set list had three\\ndozen songs, and all but the oldest and most recent ones triggered\\nimmediate singalongs.\\n\\nher constant subject is longing: for sex both tender and kinky\\nbut also for companionship and devotion. to pack all those songs\\ninto just over two hours onstage, she turned them into medleys,\\ngrouped by musical style.\\n\\nthere were minisets of keyboard-driven funk like \"nasty,\" of\\ncreamy ballads like \"again,\" of upbeat pop like \"escapade,\" of\\nhip-hop-tinged r&amp;amp;b like \"got til it\\'s gone\" (with q-tip rapping\\non the video screen) and of guitar-driven rock like \"black cat.\"\\nshe had a costume for each one and endless variations of her\\nfamiliar angular stop-and-start dance moves; the men in her troupe\\nspun through gymnastics or groveled at her feet.\\n\\nwith her hair pointing skyward in a faux-mohawk, jackson\\nappeared in futuristic sparkles, in a skintight red formal dress,\\nin a maroon bodysuit with glittery epaulets and in quasi-dominatrix\\nlingerie. her long set piece was the title song of \"discipline.\"\\na man taken from the audience was suspended in a leather harness\\nabove a supine jackson, who groped between his legs in video\\nclose-ups. at the end he babbled about his love for jackson into a\\nconvenient microphone.\\n\\njackson also reclaimed the pop she made as a teenager, before\\nshe became her own producer, with a medley from her 1982 debut\\nalbum, \"janet jackson.\" now they sound like the beginning of a\\nstyle that would merge her brother michael jackson\\'s melodic\\nchoruses with the synthesized minneapolis funk of jackson\\'s 1980s\\nrival, prince. that fusion helped shape britney spears, beyonce,\\nthe pussycat dolls and much other current pop-r&amp;amp;b.\\n\\njackson is the kind of performer who made the most of pop\\'s\\nblockbuster era. she has always relied on every enhancement of the\\nold star system. she hired skillful collaborators, catalyzing the\\nbest work from her longtime producers and songwriting partners,\\njimmy jam and terry lewis. (recent songs, without them, have lacked\\nfor melody.) studio techniques polished her modest coo of a voice,\\nand videos and photo sessions disseminated her combination of\\ngirlish smiles and sultry teases. high-gloss pop is her rightful\\nmedium, and it could well be endangered by the new austerities of\\nthe recording business and the world economy. but in all their\\nartificial splendor, her old songs still gleam.\\n\\nan article of faith among conservative critics of american\\nuniversities has been that liberal professors politically\\nindoctrinate their students. this conviction not only fueled the\\nculture wars but has also led state lawmakers to consider requiring\\ncolleges to submit reports to the government detailing their\\nprogress in ensuring \"intellectual diversity,\" prompted\\nuniversities to establish faculty positions devoted to conservatism\\nand spurred the creation of a network of volunteer watchdogs to\\nmonitor \"political correctness\" on campuses.\\n\\njust a few weeks ago, michael barone, a fellow at the\\nconservative american enterprise institute, warned in the\\nwashington times against \"the liberal thugocracy,\" arguing that\\ntoday\\'s liberals seem to be taking \"marching orders\" from\\n\"college and university campuses.\"\\n\\nbut a handful of new studies have found such worries to be\\noverwrought. three sets of researchers recently concluded that\\nprofessors have virtually no impact on the political views and\\nideology of their students.\\n\\nif there has been a conspiracy among liberal faculty members to\\ninfluence students, \"they\\'ve done a pretty bad job,\" said a. lee\\nfritschler, a professor of public policy at george mason university\\nand an author of the new book \"closed minds? politics and ideology\\nin american universities\" (brookings institution press).\\n\\nthe notion that students are induced to move leftward \"is a\\nfantasy,\" said jeremy d. mayer, another of the book\\'s authors.\\nwhen it comes to shaping a young person\\'s political views, \"it is\\nreally hard to change the mind of anyone over 15,\" said mayer, who\\ndid extensive research on faculty and students.\\n\\n\"parents and family are the most important influence,\"\\nfollowed by the news media and peers, he said. \"professors are\\namong the least influential.\"\\n\\na study of nearly 7,000 students at 38 institutions published in\\nthe current ps: political science and politics, the journal of the\\namerican political science association, as well as a second study\\nthat has been accepted by the journal to run in april 2009, both\\nreach similar conclusions.\\n\\n\"there is no evidence that an instructor\\'s views instigate\\npolitical change among students,\" matthew woessner and april\\nkelly-woessner, a husband-and-wife team of political scientists who\\nhave frequently conducted research on politics in higher education,\\nwrite in that second study.\\n\\ntheir work is often cited by people on both sides of the debate,\\nnot least because woessner describes himself as politically\\nconservative.\\n\\nno one disputes that american academia is decidedly more liberal\\nthan the rest of the population, or that there is a detectable\\nshift to the left among students during their college years. still,\\nboth studies in the peer-reviewed ps, for example, found that\\nchanges in political ideology could not be attributed to\\nproselytizing professors but rather to general trends among that\\nage group. as mack d. mariani at xavier university and gordon j.\\nhewitt at hamilton college write in the current issue, \"student\\npolitical orientation does not change for a majority of students\\nwhile in college, and for those that do change there is evidence\\nthat other factors have an effect on that change, such as gender\\nand socioeconomic status.\"\\n\\nthat may be, said daniel klein, an economist at george mason,\\nbut those results don\\'t necessarily mean there isn\\'t a problem.\\nklein, whose research has shown that registered democrats vastly\\noutnumber republicans among faculty in the humanities and social\\nsciences at american colleges and universities, maintains that the\\nfocus on the liberal-conservative split is misdirected. such terms\\nare vague and can be used to describe everything from attitudes\\nabout religion and family to the arts and lifestyles, he said.\\n\\nthe real issue, said klein, who calls himself a libertarian, is\\nthat social democratic ideas dominate universities -- ideas that\\nplay down the importance of the individual and promote government\\nintervention.\\n\\nsuch \"academic groupthink\" means that the works of such\\nthinkers are not offered enough, he argues. \"a major tragedy is\\nthat they\\'re not getting exposed to the good stuff,\" he said,\\nciting the works of john stuart mill, adam smith, friedrich hayek\\nand milton friedman.\\n\\n\"even if we had hard, definite evidence that students weren\\'t\\ninfluenced by their professors, there is still reason for great\\nconcern about the composition of the faculty,\" klein added.\\n\\nk.c. johnson, a historian at the city university of new york,\\ncharacterizes the problem as pedagogical, not political. entire\\nfields of study, from traditional literary analysis to political\\nand military history, are simply not widely taught anymore, johnson\\ncontended: \"even students who want to learn don\\'t have the\\nopportunity, because there are no specialists on the faculty to\\ntake courses from.\"\\n\\n\"the conservative critics are inventing a straw man that\\ndoesn\\'t exist and are missing the real problem that does,\" he\\nadded.\\n\\nanne neal, the president of the american council of trustees and\\nalumni, which closely follows this issue, agrees that \"it is not\\nabout left and right.\"\\n\\nmany researchers and critics also agree that a better grounding\\nin american history and politics is important. \"it wasn\\'t too long\\nago that schools and universities required civic education and\\namerican history,\" fritschler noted. \"almost all of those\\nrequirements have evaporated.\"\\n\\na number of organizations that have a large base of conservative\\nsupporters, like neal\\'s council and the national association of\\nscholars, have been promoting a return to traditional courses in\\nwestern civilization and american history.\\n\\nfritschler said that perhaps the most insidious side effect of\\nassumptions about liberal influence has been an overall\\ndisengagement on campus from civic and political affairs, and a\\nreluctance to promote serious debate of political issues. if\\nanything, he added, the problem is not too much politics, but too\\nlittle.\\n\\n\\'that don\\'t make me a bad guy\\' (show dog nashville)\\n\\ntoby keith\\n\\n\"you already love me\" has all the makings of a great toby\\nkeith song: misbehaving with the boys, disappointing the girl,\\nknowing perfectly well a relationship isn\\'t built to last. \"baby\\ngirl,\" keith sings. \"i know that you could do better than me,\\nmaybe.\" had he recorded this song five or so years ago, that\\n\"maybe\" would have been a winking taunt, an acknowledgment that\\nhe was getting away with something. but here, on keith\\'s 12th\\nstudio album, \"that don\\'t make me a bad guy,\" it\\'s a note of\\nresignation. \"it\\'s too late,\" he continues. \"you already love\\nme.\" nothing to be done now.\\n\\nfor years keith has been reliably blustery, but today his chest\\nis no longer puffed. this album continues a genteel streak that\\nhe\\'s been cultivating lately, perhaps as a corrective to his public\\npersona of swagger and jingoism. this is gentleman country, and\\nwhat\\'s surprising is how natural it sounds. while these vocals lack\\nhis characteristic robustness, his gift for melody is intact. and\\nshockingly, his heart is wide open. on \"hurt a lot worse when you\\ngo,\" he lets a woman walk all over him: \"go on and call me\\nup/tell me you made a grave mistake/you know i never once turned\\nyou away.\"\\n\\nbut still, the specters of songs that could have been hang all\\nover this album. the title track has echoes of the excellent 2005\\nhit \"as good as i once was,\" which insisted, \"i\\'m as good once\\nas i ever was.\" here you can hear keith practically begging for\\nre-evaluation. \"i\\'m only good as i gotta be,\" he notes, though\\n\"that don\\'t make me a bad guy.\" in 2003 keith released the single\\n\"american soldier,\" a celebration of country-first loyalty that\\nbecame one of the defining pop-music statements of this wartime\\nera. on his new album, in the song \"missing me some you,\" that\\nsoldier is staring at the sky -- \"stars down in dixie look the same\\nway here\" in a way that more recalls \"somewhere out there,\" from\\nthe animated film \"an american tail.\"\\n\\nkeith produced this album, and his arrangements lack the\\ndramatic builds that have always been a hallmark of his sound.\\ninstead he tends to genial blues licks and polite country shuffles.\\nonly \"god love her\" truly recalls the keith of old. at the\\nbeginning of the song he runs away with the preacher\\'s daughter.\\nbut by the end he\\'s turned soft: \"like an angel, she saved my soul\\nfrom the devil.\" back in the day she would never have been allowed\\nto meddle.\\n\\n-- jon caramanica\\n\\n      \\'4:13 dream\\' (suretone/geffen)\\n      the cure\\n\\nthere\\'s wah-wah all over the place on the cure\\'s 13th studio\\nalbum, \"4:13 dream.\" through a 30-year recording career robert\\nsmith has led the cure through various recurring modes. behind his\\nslurred, quavery, perpetually nervous yelp, the cure has put across\\nstripped-down new wave, brooding, synthesizer-dominated dirges;\\ncrisp pop; electronics-dominated dance music; vigorously strummed\\nfolk-rock; and splashy, distorted quasi-psychedelic rock. the new\\nalbum is one of the splashy ones, with uptempo songs awash in\\nguitar reverb and cymbal whooshes, akin to albums like \"wish\"\\n(1992) and parts of \"kiss me, kiss me, kiss me\" (1987) and \"wild\\nmood swings\" (1996). the territory is familiar, occasionally too\\nfamiliar. \"i\\'ve been down here before,\" smith sings in \"the\\nscream.\" but it\\'s not a comforting nostalgic reprise; it\\'s another\\nplunge into the maelstrom.\\n\\nthe upbeat songs don\\'t mean that smith, one of rock\\'s most\\narticulate mopers, has gotten all happy. the album includes two\\nlove songs in which, amazingly enough, things are working out\\neuphorically: \"the only one,\" a list of all the sensations his\\nlover gives him, and \"this. here and now. with you.,\" in which\\nthe rapture of the moment nearly eclipses all the singer\\'s\\nmisgivings. pealing guitars carry \"the perfect boy,\" which turns\\nout to be about a girl\\'s optimistic self-delusions; smith leaves\\nher still hoping for her happy ending.\\n\\nbut it\\'s not like the cure to settle into lasting contentment,\\nand the rest of \"4:13 dream\" is filled with upheavals. as the\\nband churns ahead, mr. smith blurts lyrics about insecurity\\n(\"sirensong\"), disorientation (\"freakshow\"), infidelity (\"the\\nreal snow white\") and bitterness about materialism (\"the hungry\\nghost\"). in \"switch\" smith returns to his lifelong alienation --\\n\"i\\'m sick of being alone with myself/and i\\'m sick of being with\\nanyone else\" -- as porl thompson\\'s guitar scrapes and chatters, and\\njason cooper\\'s live and looped drumbeats go bounding ahead. on this\\nhyperactive cure album there\\'s barely any gap between exultation\\nand desperate flailing.\\n\\n-- jon pareles\\n\\n      \\'the renaissance\\' (motown)\\n      q-tip\\n\\nthe last time q-tip put out an album, he was kick-starting a\\nsolo career after the disbandment of a tribe called quest. that was\\nnine years ago, an eternity in hip-hop, and his record-industry\\njourney since has been downright purgatorial. an unreceptive label\\nshelved his intended follow-up; subsequent efforts met with a\\nsimilar fate. small wonder this rapper and producer feels as if\\nhe\\'s emerging from the dark ages.\\n\\nbut if \"the renaissance\" signals a revival, it also sticks to\\nan established script. its sound, an upbeat amalgam of\\njazz-inflected funk, will ring familiar to any q-tip fan, or even\\nto the average hip-hop nostalgist. a few of the album\\'s tracks can\\nalso be found, with only slight variation, on \"open,\" one of\\nthose unofficial releases. and of course there\\'s that voice --\\nnasal, grainy, a little smart-alecky -- still accentuating the\\npositive.\\n\\nq-tip took a hands-on role as producer of \"the renaissance,\"\\nto the point that the music can overshadow the rapping. (it\\'s\\nfitting that he appears on the album\\'s cover with an mpc 2000xl\\nsampler obscuring his face.) he has a taste for head-bobbing tempos\\nand in-the-pocket bass lines, some lifted from vintage soul\\nrecords. he elicits inventive work from musicians like the\\nguitarist kurt rosenwinkel. and he makes decent use of his guest\\nsingers, including a classically suave d\\'angelo, an\\nandrogynous-sounding raphael saadiq, a sassy amanda diva and a\\ncoolly ethereal norah jones.\\n\\nsome of this works wickedly -- \"believe,\" the d\\'angelo track,\\nis a keeper, as is \"gettin\\' up,\" a charismatic come-on -- but\\nthere are just as many small missteps. a few tracks, notably\\n\"manwomanboogie,\" generate interesting frictions but no palpable\\nmomentum; \"official\" and \"you\" suffer from lackluster rhymes.\\n\\nand worse, \"dance on glass\" begins with this dispiriting\\ncouplet: \"the people at the label say they want something to\\nrepeat/ but all my people really want something for the streets.\"\\nq-tip doesn\\'t appear to realize how ridiculous that sounds.\\n\\nperhaps tellingly, the standout track is \"move,\" the only one\\ncreated by an outsider. it\\'s credited to j dilla, the producer who\\ndied in 2006 and worked with q-tip on his long-ago solo debut. here\\nthe resourcefully choppy use of a jackson 5 tune produces something\\ndeep, funky and layered. rapping over it, q-tip sounds loose and\\nunburdened.\\n\\n-- nate chinen\\n\\n      \\'hemispheres\\' (artistshare)\\n      jim hall &amp;amp; bill frisell\\n\\nbill frisell is one of the stylistic children of the jazz\\nguitarist jim hall. both share a mild sense of humor in their music\\n-- composed and improvised -- and a subtle fanaticism for country and\\nblues language. these similarities come out in phrasing and\\nharmonic vocabulary, the bricks of their playing. but it\\'s in the\\nrealm of sound where these musicians find their differences and\\nchallenge each other on \"hemispheres.\"\\n\\nhall started in the 1940s, and his is the sound is modesty: he\\nplays a hollow-body guitar, de-trebling his soft sound with the\\ntone knob. frisell, who grew up on rock \\'n\\' roll, wants to sparkle.\\nhe uses digital effects, and his notes last longer, hovering in the\\nair; he likes to make his instrument sound like other things --\\nhorns, whales, warped honky-tonk records. here each guitarist\\nspends time in the other\\'s extremes. on several tracks there are\\nfew rules at all, and the music becomes purely free and gestural:\\nno plan, no melody -- just sound. likewise, on some tracks frisell\\nscales back to play traditional forms at hall\\'s reduced-volume\\nlevel, and you have to stick your ear into the rustling to hear\\nwho\\'s who.\\n\\nthey have recorded together before, on \"dialogues,\" from 1995,\\nbut that was back when record labels were concerned about length.\\n\"hemispheres\" -- half duets, half quartet recordings with the\\nbassist scott colley and the drummer joey baron -- is a digital\\nrelease on artistshare, downloadable from artistshare.com, where\\nyou get more: not just the album but outtakes, previous\\nperformances, videos of conversations and interviews. the package\\nis geared toward listener satiation, which suits hall and frisell\\nfine. they seem as if they could linger over their family\\nresemblance for much more than the album\\'s two-hour duration. days\\nmore, years more.\\n\\nthis record is a lot to take in. it\\'s not austere, but it is so\\nreserved, so subtonally understated, that to breathe loudly over it\\nis a minor crudeness. there are originals and jazz standards here,\\nbut also a duet version of bob dylan\\'s \"masters of war.\" and\\nsometimes it\\'s unapologetically meandering: the dreamlike\\n\"migration,\" with frisell constructing digital loops and hall\\nplaying droning noises or blues phrases over the shimmering\\nbackdrops, doesn\\'t need to be 15 minutes long.\\n\\nin the quartet half, though, the performances are focused but\\nstill playful, and at best -- as in \"owed to freddie green,\" in\\nwhich both guitarists improvise simultaneously with quiet daring\\nover swing rhythm -- they connect in a properly complicated way.\\n\\n-- ben ratliff\\n\\nthe treasury\\'s schedule of financing

the white house, u.s. influence in the region has fallen\\nsharply.\\n\\nboth presidential candidates, john mccain and barack obama,\\ncriticize bush\\'s foreign policy performance. so what would they do\\ndifferently, and what challenges would they face in the region?\\n\\nsen. obama has never visited latin america, as sen. mccain\\nreminded the audience at the last debate. nevertheless, obama\\'s\\ncandidacy has excited enormous interest there, especially in\\ncountries with large black populations such as brazil.\\n\\nmccain has traveled to the region extensively. he was deeply\\ninvolved in u.s. policy in central america during the 1980s when\\nthe reagan administration sent weapons and financial aid to help\\ndefeat left-wing revolutionaries in el salvador and nicaragua.\\n\\nexperts note that latin america has never loomed very large on\\nwashington\\'s radar screen, at least until a crisis explodes. given\\nthe wars in iraq and afghanistan, as well as the current economic\\ncrisis, \"it seems unlikely that the united states will be able to\\ngive latin america the attention that it needs in the coming few\\nyears,\" says susan kaufman purcell, director of the center for\\nhemispheric policy in miami.\\n\\nbrazil: president bush\\'s promotion of ethanol helped develop a\\nsurprisingly close personal relationship with brazil\\'s moderate\\nleftist president, luis inacio lula da silva. brazil has emerged as\\narguably the most important strategic u.s. ally in the region.\\n\\nmccain supports lifting a tariff on brazilian ethanol. but this\\nis unpopular in america\\'s grain states. obama would keep the\\ntariff.\\n\\nobama is popular with dark-skinned brazilians, who make up about\\nhalf the population.\\n\\ncuba: a mccain administration would stick with the\\nfour-decades-old economic embargo. mccain says he would try to\\nstrengthen it through greater international support. bush tried\\nthat but didn\\'t get anywhere.\\n\\nobama says he would immediately lift recent restrictions on\\ncuban-americans traveling to the island and sending money to their\\nfamilies there. he says he is ready to meet with cuban leader raul\\ncastro, though it is not clear under what conditions.\\n\\ncolombia: mccain is a staunch supporter of plan colombia, the\\ndecade-old $5-billion program to help fight drugs and guerrillas.\\nhe also backs a free trade agreement with colombia currently\\nstalled in congress.\\n\\nobama has supported plan colombia, but opposed the proposed free\\ntrade pact with colombia because of abuses of trade unionists.\\nobama says he doesn\\'t oppose free trade on principle. he supported\\nfree trade with peru.\\n\\nhaiti: though he leans to the left, haitian president rene\\npreval is a good friend of the united states. he recognizes the\\nimportance of u.s. aid, especially in the wake of a disastrous\\nhurricane season.\\n\\nobama may be more sympathetic to pressure from the black caucus\\nin congress to grant temporary status to undocumented haitians in\\nthe united states. after hurricanes gustav and ike, which left more\\nthan 500 haitians dead and destroyed the country\\'s road network,\\nthe bush administration temporarily suspended deportation of\\nhaitians.\\n\\nmccain is also sympathetic on immigrant issues, though he has\\nnot taken an active interest in haiti policy.\\n\\nmexico: a bloody drug war in mexico has barely been mentioned in\\nthe campaign.\\n\\nmccain made a campaign stop in mexico in july, the first ever by\\na presidential candidate, and offered his support for president\\nfelipe calderon.\\n\\nfalling oil production in mexico has prompted urgent calls for\\nreform of laws governing mexico\\'s state oil monopoly. mexico is the\\nsecond-largest supplier of oil to the united states.\\n\\nearlier this year congress passed the merida initiative, a\\nfive-year, $1.4-billion plan to bolster security. the first\\n$400-million in funds will begin to flow before bush leaves office.\\n\\nmccain and obama are sympathetic to calls for comprehensive\\nimmigration reform that could favor undocumented mexicans. mccain\\nhardened his position during the campaign to a\\n\"secure-the-border-first\" stand.\\n\\nvenezuela: both candidates have expressed concern over president\\nhugo chavez\\'s antidemocratic ways.\\n\\nmccain adviser otto reich, whom bush appointed as his top state\\ndepartment official for latin america, says the united states\\nshould suspend all venezuelan oil imports, 10 percent of the u.s.\\ntotal. that would send prices higher in the united states, experts\\nsay, and chavez would likely have no problem selling his oil\\nelsewhere.\\n\\nobama is more willing to sit down and work out their\\ndifferences. \"it is important for us not to overreact in relation\\nto chavez,\" he said in one recent interview. \"what we must do is\\nto make him understand that we do not want him to

was light in my hands, not at all how i imagined a\\n9mm glock would feel.\\n\\ni had never fired a gun in my life. my instructor put both my\\nhands around the frame and then signaled for me to squeeze the\\ntrigger.\\n\\nblam.\\n\\nthe bullet pierced my target, an 8.5-by-11-inch sheet of copy\\npaper, near the center.\\n\\nthen it hit me. this is how it is done. this is how you take a\\nlife. my target was fictional, but in my mind he was still a\\nthreat. i felt no sadness.\\n\\nthat\\'s why soon i\\'ll be the first person in my immediate family\\nand circle of friends to get a concealed weapons permit.\\n\\ni wanted training before purchasing a gun, so i enrolled in\\nclass at shooting sports of tampa. when i arrived, my nerves\\ncalmed. half of my class of 15 was female. and a quarter of us were\\nblack.\\n\\nit\\'s not just me, i thought to myself. everyone is afraid these\\ndays.\\n\\nat shooting sports, the building smelled as if it were on fire,\\nand all 15 people in my class were herded into a tiny room off in\\nthe corner where our instructor put the fear of god in us before we\\neven got into the gun range.\\n\\n\"just because you have a gun does not mean you are capable of\\nfighting with a gun,\" he cautioned. \"no sane person in the world\\nwould ever want to be in a gunfight.\"\\n\\nthough i was never around them, guns were a part of life where i\\ngrew up, washington, d.c. but because of a handgun ban, the only\\nfolks who had them were cops and criminals, until the rule was\\nreversed by the supreme court earlier this year.\\n\\nstill, i never felt unsafe. not until i moved to florida alone.\\nnow i\\'ll take my chances on fighting for myself. i haven\\'t had much\\nluck with the kindness of strangers.\\n\\nsince living on my own in florida, i have not been able to name\\nthe person next door to me at any point. no one has come to\\nintroduce themselves. and the one time i tried to be cordial, the\\nneighbor peered through the blinds and never opened the door. i am\\nnot confident that woman would have called the police if she ever\\nheard me scream inside my apartment.\\n\\nin my junior year of college at florida a&amp;amp;m university in\\ntallahassee, i had a roommate who never spoke to me. only by\\nlooking at her mail did i know her name. we never interacted.\\n\\ni spent a lot of time in my room with the door locked. when i\\nwent home for christmas break, i bought a storage unit for my\\nvaluables because i was afraid she\\'d rob me. when i returned, she\\nwas gone, and i was living alone for the first time ever. the\\nsummer before i moved in, the house next door was invaded, and a\\ngirl was killed.\\n\\ni was terrified.\\n\\nthat was the first time getting a gun ever entered my mind. but\\ni\\'d never even seen one in person and was sure that 20 was not old\\nenough to buy a gun. twenty-year-olds aren\\'t even allowed to drink\\nbeer, they couldn\\'t possibly get hold of a firearm, right?\\n\\nbut in florida, you can buy a handgun from a private person or a\\nrifle or shotgun from a licensed dealer at 18. you have to be 21 to\\nget a concealed weapons permit, and gun safety training is\\nmandatory. \"permit holders are held to a different standard,\" my\\ninstructor said.\\n\\ni had to buy 50 rounds in class to get through my target\\npractice. protective ear covers muffled the sounds of the\\ncontrolled explosions at the end of my arm. protective eyewear kept\\nthe little metal shavings from the side walls from flying into my\\neyes. a couple of hot shell casings flew out and landed on my\\nhands, temporarily searing knuckles and making me wince with my\\nfinger still on the trigger.\\n\\ni\\'d fired the gun  in class. but if my paper assailant was flesh\\nand blood could i do the same thing? could i defend my own life?\\n\\nthen i thought about nefertiti williams.\\n\\na 20-year-old public relations student, she had leaned on me for\\nhelp developing her story ideas because i was the editor of the\\nschool magazine at the time. she was bright, perceptive, had good\\ninstincts and asked the right questions. she called me momma robbyn\\nat times, a nickname i didn\\'t embrace well at 21. the wednesday\\nbefore thanksgiving 2006, i got a call from my roommate and close\\nfriend telling me nefertiti hadn\\'t made it back to bradenton. she\\nhad been murdered in her own home by a roommate after everyone else\\nhad left for the holiday.\\n\\nhe had shot her in the face  just under her cheekbone before\\nshooting himself. police later said he\\'d been experiencing\\ndepression because he was no longer enrolled in school and that it\\nwas unclear why he had shot her. it could have been a crime of\\npassion or just a mistake that he felt he couldn\\'t live with.\\n\\nwhen we returned to school, there were candles and vigils and\\ncrying and sorrow. but there were no answers. would this have been\\ndifferent if she had a gun in her bedroom or in one of many\\ndesigner purses? i don\\'t know. but the odds wouldn\\'t have been so\\nstacked against her.\\n\\ngetting my footing was a challenge at the range. when my feet\\nwere far enough apart, my shoulders were too far back. when my\\nshoulders were above my toes, my thumbs were behind the hammer.\\nwhen my thumbs were crisscrossed, my feet were too close together.\\ni was comfortable firing this gun, but not with following the\\ninstructions. what was wrong with me?\\n\\ni do understand the power of guns.\\n\\nmy father was gunned down while he was leaving a convenience\\nstore. i was 2. he wasn\\'t a criminal, and he had never owned a gun.\\nhe was in the air force. he knew how to use a gun. he learned it in\\nbasic training. he could have had one easily, but the law wasn\\'t on\\nhis side.\\n\\nprobably not coincidentally, washington, d.c., was known as the\\nmurder capital for much of my childhood. the law is on my side\\nhere, and i intend to take advantage of the opportunity.\\n\\nso i started researching the process of obtaining a concealed\\nweapons permit and purchasing a gun. it\\'s not hard, but it takes\\ntime. you have to really want it.\\n\\nfirst you have to submit a form to get the application mailed to\\nyou, which can take two weeks. then comes certification class. four\\nhours of safety training. proving competency with firing a weapon\\nwas difficult since it was first gun i had ever touched.\\n\\nbut i earned the certificate necessary for my application. then\\ni got a $15 passport photo and my fingerprints taken digitally and\\nput in the state database at the tampa police station. that service\\nwas $49. then i took everything to a notary and had them seal my\\napplication, got a money order for $75, paid postage and sent the\\napplication to tallahassee. if i qualify, the florida department of\\nagriculture and consumer services will promptly issue me my permit\\nnext year. i\\'ve been without a gun for 23 years, so i\\'ll just wait\\na little longer now.\\n\\nis my mother supportive? no. she jokes about it with my brother\\nand calls me little (sarah) palin but something tells me she\\'s not\\nsold on the idea.\\n\\n\"why would you want a gun?\" she said. \"what if someone uses\\nit on you?\" \"what if it goes off by accident?\" \"do you even\\nknow how to use a gun?\" \"what if the other person has a gun\\ntoo?\"\\n\\nnothing i said could convince her that there may be an upside to\\nbeing able to defend yourself. but she understands that i am an\\nadult and my decisions are my own. her nervousness was making me a\\nbit uneasy with my decision. what if i really can\\'t handle a gun?\\nwhat if i\\'m forgetful with it like my wallet and someone uses it to\\ncommit a crime? what if someone steals my car? or snatches the\\npurse i picked out to carry it in?\\n\\nin the end, i fight one type of paranoia and embrace the other.\\nat least with a gun, i can level the playing field. i\\'ve picked out\\nmy glock 19 at shooting sports and i plan to make my purchase the\\nday after thanksgiving. i\\'m planning to start by carrying my gun\\neverywhere i\\'m allowed to on the weekend while attending ladies\\'\\nnight at the range on mondays. after that, who knows? maybe i\\'ll\\ncarry every day. you can\\'t know. and that\\'s the point.\\n\\nrobbyn

began friday morning on the web site of tarisio\\n(tarisio.com), auctioneers of fine stringed instruments and bows.\\nsure enough, the cello, made in 1717 by antonio stradivari and\\nnamed after amaryllis fleming, the half-sister of ian fleming,\\nquickly attracted a record bid of $1.35 million. but then, silence.\\n\\nas the minutes ticked by jason price, a partner in the company,\\nrefreshed the screen of his mac powerbook and fidgeted with his\\niphone, his hopes of a higher figure -- or better yet, a bidding war\\n-- slowly evaporating. even more nerve-racking, the one bid in hand,\\nabout $600,000 higher than the record paid for another stradivari\\ncello sold by sotheby\\'s in 1988, failed to meet the reserve price,\\nwhich was kept confidential by tarisio and the fleming family. the\\ncello had been valued at $1.48 million to $1.97 million.\\n\\n\"we\\'re down in the zero-second range,\" price, 32, said just\\nbefore the bidding closed at 1 p.m. \"we\\'re getting closer.\"\\n\\nat the stroke of 1 p.m., the words \"bidding has ended\" flashed\\non his screen. \"now we begin,\" he said, closing his manhattan\\noffice on west 54th street to visitors and initiating a series of\\nphone calls he hoped would result in a post-auction agreement\\nbetween the bidder and the flemings. as of sunday afternoon,\\nnegotiations were continuing.\\n\\n\"i think we are in uncharted territory with our economy, and i\\nthink that puts the fear of god into a lot of people who a year ago\\nweren\\'t fearful,\" price speculated later as he packed for an\\nevening flight to london to return the fleming, which had its own\\nticket and seat.\\n\\nmade in cremona, italy, the instrument is one of only 60 or so\\nstradivari cellos in existence. it is patterned on the b-form like\\nthe davidoff, which jacqueline du pre bequeathed to yo-yo ma, and\\nthe duport, played by mstislav rostropovich. fleming, who died in\\n1999, was the daughter of the painter augustus john and apparently\\nhad both a passion for bach and a reputation as a femme fatale. she\\nbought the cello in the 1960s and used it to perform and teach.\\n(her students included raphael wallfisch.)\\n\\nthe fleming\\'s value might have increased fivefold had the\\ncello\\'s top and head not been replaced in the mid-18th-century by\\nthe spanish luthier jose contreras, said simon morris, a director\\nof j &amp;amp; a beare, the company that would certify the cello upon its\\nsale.\\n\\n\"i think it\\'s just very unfortunate timing,\" said mark\\nmessenger, head of strings at the royal college of music in london,\\nwhere fleming had studied and taught, and which is to benefit from\\nthe sale. \"we couldn\\'t have foreseen that people would have been\\nso reluctant to invest money.\"\\n\\ndespite the failure to find a buyer, morris called the market\\nfor antique stringed instruments \"a fantastic investment.\"\\n\\n\"nobody needs a calf in a tank of formaldehyde for 8 million\\npounds, but if you think you can buy a violin by the best craftsman\\nthat ever lived, it looks pretty reasonable,\" he said, referring\\nto damien hirst\\'s \"golden calf,\" which sold in september at\\nsotheby\\'s for $18.6 million.\\n\\nfor decades investors have been tempted by the creations of\\nmaster italian craftsmen like stradivari, giuseppe guarneri and\\nnicolo amati, instruments whose escalating value is fueled by\\ncraftsmanship that can\\'t be replicated, and myth -- was the\\ninstrument heard by mozart or beethoven? -- scarcity and need. until\\nfriday, the allure only seemed to be increasing.\\n\\nin 2005 maxim viktorov, a russian lawyer, paid $1.05 million for\\na bergonzi violin made around 1720 and once owned by paganini;\\nearlier this year he paid $3.9 million for a 1741 guarnerius, after\\nwhich he flew the violinist pinchas zukerman to moscow, where the\\nviolin was played publicly for the first time in more than 70\\nyears. more recently ian stoutzker, a london banker and\\nphilanthropist, is said to have consigned his own 1741 guarnerius\\nfor a reported $20 million to the chicago dealer geoffrey fushi, of\\nbein &amp;amp; fushi.\\n\\ntarisio was founded in 1999 by price, who studied cello and\\nlater violin-making in cremona and parma; dmitry gindin, a\\nlondon-based dealer and author; and christopher reuning, a boston\\ndealer and restorer. in the ebay era, the partners hoped to take\\nadvantage of the ease and privacy of online bidding while providing\\nthe services -- viewings, valuations and guarantees -- of\\nbrick-and-mortar auction houses. in 2003 they were awarded the sale\\nof the isaac stern estate, which grossed $3.3 million. last year\\ntarisio, which also brokers private sales, did close to $12million\\nin gross sales, price said.\\n\\nafter months of showcasing the fleming\\'s luscious tone and\\nvibrant beauty at viewings in london, new york, boston and cremona,\\nprice spent the weekend \"trying to put people in touch and make\\nthings happen\" on the cello\\'s behalf, though he said there was no\\nrush.\\n\\n\"i think it takes a magical relationship between an instrument\\nand the right person,\" he said with a mixture of wistfulness and\\npragmatism. \"it\\'s like matchmaking. you can\\'t always be sure to\\nfind your match.\"\\n\\nin the recent indie release \"momma\\'s man,\" a young\\nfather named mikey returns to his hometown of new york city on a\\nbusiness trip, and after spending a few days at his parents\\' house,\\nrefuses to leave. he putters around his childhood home, an old\\ntribeca loft, and the vastly changed neighborhood, avoiding his\\nwife, his job, his whole adult life.\\n\\nin this apartment, where the director, azazel jacobs, grew up\\nand where his parents still live, mikey regresses, drifting back\\nthrough time, getting drunk on his own immaturity.\\n\\nbut it is not a time capsule for just him. watching this movie\\nduring its run here in late summer was a voyage to a distant past\\nfor new yorkers who remember when \"loft\" meant something quite\\ndifferent from the \"luxury apartment with huge windows\" that it\\nhas come to signify.\\n\\nmikey\\'s loft is the sort of place one might have found in\\ndowntown manhattan 30 years ago: a wide-open apartment with a\\nsweeping high ceiling, cut from an old manufacturing space.\\n\\nthere was a romance attached to loft living in those days; they\\nseemed bohemian and sexy. but it wasn\\'t always easy.\\n\\n\"you go back to the \\'70s, it was painful to live in a loft,\"\\nsaid chuck delaney, a founding member of the lower manhattan loft\\ntenants association. \"people did it because it was cheap and\\nbig.\"\\n\\nthose raw spaces are difficult to find these days -- maybe\\nimpossible in manhattan -- but they do exist in pockets of the other\\nboroughs. in less-established neighborhoods, they can even be\\naffordable, especially if you are looking to rent, rather than buy.\\n\\nmark reigelman, 25, a designer from cleveland, moved into just\\nthis sort of apartment two years ago: a 1,100-square-foot room in\\nbushwick, brooklyn.\\n\\nreigelman came to new york two and a half years ago for a design\\ninternship. \"after that,\" he said, \"it was either find a job or\\ntry to make my own work successful.\" he chose the latter.\\n\\nnow he makes his living as a freelance designer, splitting the\\n$1,800 monthly rent with two roommates: his cousin cortney elias,\\nan 18-year-old cosmetology student; and chris neuman, 25, who\\ndesigns graphics for video games.\\n\\n\"it was like a blank canvas,\" reigelman said of his apartment.\\n\"it had an identity, but it was so loosely configured, it was\\nreally easy to come in and make it something brand-new, make\\nsomething that at the end of the day, we felt was really ours.\"\\n\\nreigelman is trained in sculpture and industrial design, and his\\noriginal roommate was a sculptor. \"we already had the tools and\\nthe know-how,\" he said. the two men ordered wood and got to work\\nbuilding three bedrooms and a loft office, one room stacked on top\\nof another, creating two rooms on either side of the space.\\n\\ntheir loft is in a building called the tea factory, a name drawn\\nfrom history. at one point, it was owned by spice and tea\\nexclusively ltd.\\n\\nlight manufacturing of this sort used to be common in new york\\ncity. according to mitchell moss, a professor of urban policy and\\nplanning at new york university, only about 100,000 manufacturing\\njobs remain in the city, a tenth of the total at the peak after\\nworld war ii.\\n\\nas businesses trickled out of the city, landlords began renting\\nmanufacturing space to individuals, either to fill vacancies or to\\nget higher rent from residential tenants.\\n\\nthe buildings often had basic plumbing, but heat was unreliable.\\nrooms and walls were not part of the deal, much less garbage\\npickup. some lofts were rife with fire hazards. these spaces were\\ngenerally not up to code or were not zoned for residential use.\\ntenants lived illegally under commercial leases or other tenuous\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n\"there was a shivery feeling that you could be evicted at any\\ntime,\" said sharon zukin, a professor of sociology at brooklyn\\ncollege and the author of \"loft living: culture and capital in\\nurban change\" (rutgers university press, 1989).\\n\\n\"you had to be a certain kind of person, who didn\\'t require the\\nsanitation department to pick up your garbage, didn\\'t have to have\\nheat seven days a week,\" zukin said. you had \"to do a lot of your\\nown work to make your space habitable.\" illegal lofts are still\\nscattered throughout the five boroughs, from northern manhattan to\\ncarroll gardens, brooklyn. it is impossible to know how many.\\n\\nin the 1970s and 1980s, there were several attempts to bring\\nlofts under a regulatory umbrella. the artist-in-residence program\\nauthorized artists to live in some manufacturing buildings. next,\\nthe city rezoned large swaths of downtown and created the loft\\nboard. its landlord, tenant and city representatives were meant to\\nsettle disputes, bring buildings up to code and make them a part of\\nthe rent-stabilization system.\\n\\n\"industry declined very, very rapidly between \\'69 and \\'75,\"\\nsaid sandy hornick, the director of strategic planning for new york\\ncity. the loft regulations that followed, he said, were \"a\\nrecognition of this sort of changing phenomenon, trying to bring\\nsome order to the chaos.\"\\n\\nthe original settlers of loft buildings were often artists eager\\nto take advantage of cheap rents as well as big spaces and\\nload-bearing floors, which allowed for large projects.\\n\\n\"a lot of them were, if not artists, craftsmen of some sort or\\nanother who both lived and worked in their spaces,\" said carl\\nweisbrod, the first chairman of the loft board and now the head of\\ntrinity church\\'s real estate operations. whatever their\\noccupations, he added, they had to be \"particularly handy and\\nresilient and resourceful, so they could really create a living\\nspace.\" today, a second or third generation of tenants live in\\nthese lofts, often without the hardships that their predecessors in\\nthe \\'70s experienced.\\n\\ntwo years ago, when albert senavitis moved into an apartment in\\nan old bushwick loft building once owned by a plastics company, a\\nsleeping loft was already there. senavitis, 22, a film student at\\nthe school of visual arts, uses the big open space to screen\\nmovies, create art installations with friends, and even shoot\\nfilms.\\n\\non a corner of his block, a vestige of industrial new york\\nremains, a stone fabrication shop where slabs of rock are cut and\\npolished for things like countertops. \"you always see dust and\\nsparks flying around here,\" senavitis said. \"then, at like 5\\no\\'clock, it\\'s dead.\"\\n\\nasked if he feels safe in the neighborhood, senavitis said, \"in\\nthis part of bushwick, definitely; other parts, not so much.\" last\\nspring, he was mugged while walking to a friend\\'s house in a far\\ncorner of the neighborhood. but senavitis is undeterred. \"i love\\nthis area,\" he said.\\n\\nhe and his roommate split the $1,850 monthly rent.\\n\\n      (end optional trim.)\\n\\nhowever raw the space or cheap the rent, if the apartments are\\nlegal, loft tenants are entitled to the same residential services\\nas any other new yorker.\\n\\nand unlike their predecessors, most of this latest breed of\\ntenants expect those services. \"when i rented lofts -- and i rented\\na lot of them -- i took care of everything,\" said frank shifreen, a\\n56-year-old artist who has lived in new york for several decades.\\nnow, he owns a loft building on staten island that was used for\\nlight manufacturing, probably of textiles.\\n\\nhe finds tenants uninterested in doing the repairs that he took\\ncare of himself. \"people want to rent apartments, so i\\'ve become a\\nhands-on landlord,\" he said with palpable disappointment.\\n\\nleila abdoulaye sublets a friend\\'s loft in an old piano factory\\nin the south bronx, and she need never worry about repairs. her\\nbuilding, called the clock tower, has a 24-hour superintendent.\\n\\nabdoulaye, a 25-year-old student and model who also works as a\\nrestaurant office manager, pays $700 a month for her room. she\\nshares the apartment with a rotating stream of models. abdoulaye\\nminds the store, as it were, between work and classes.\\n\\n\"it\\'s the quality of the place, the price of the apartment, and\\nthe social life,\" abdoulaye says. \"it\\'s a nice place to live. a\\nhappy place to live.\"\\n\\ndaniel lundby, 32, an out-of-work designer from iowa, also lives\\nin the clock tower, sharing a bright, open space with a roommate.\\n\\nwhen he moved to new york city, he lived in a tiny sublet on the\\nupper east side. \"now,\" lundby said, \"i have three times the\\nspace for the same price.\" his rent has risen about $100 a year\\nsince he moved in more than four years ago, but he says he is\\nsatisfied. \"i think i\\'m still getting a decent deal. it\\'s still\\nworth it to me.\"\\n\\nfor some, the lifestyle of loft buildings that have not been\\nrenovated to shiny opulence is what makes the places appealing.\\n\\nian roberts, 28, lives in a loft on mckibben street in bushwick\\n-- in one of two buildings that have earned the nickname mckibben\\ndorms for their young residents and high turnover, as well as their\\nwild parties and overcrowded apartments.\\n\\nthe noise and the parties are certainly present, roberts says,\\nas well as some persistent leaks. but on the other hand, his share\\nof the rent is $835 a month and the place can take what he and his\\nroommates dish out.\\n\\n\"with these floors,\" he said, pointing to hardwood that had\\nseen better days, \"we don\\'t have to worry about sliding light\\nstands or doing crafts projects.\" roberts and two of his three\\nroommates are photographers.\\n\\n\"i just like to be able to walk in my apartment,\" said\\nroberts, striding back and forth. \"i just like space.\"\\n\\nhe and jeff brown have lived in the loft for three years. they\\nbuilt the bedrooms themselves -- roberts\\' father, a general\\ncontractor, provided some tips.\\n\\nlike many loft apartments, theirs is a big rectangular room\\ncarved out of a much larger floor. it has windows on only one wall,\\nwhich means the bedrooms, built on the interior, are stuffy and\\ndim. but then again those windows stretch 30 feet wide and are 8\\n1/2 feet tall.\\n\\n\"one of the best parts about living here is the sun,\" roberts\\nsaid with his arms splayed wide, pointing left and right. \"it\\nreally does come up over there and set over there.\"\\n\\nthis incident has entered operatic lore: ten years\\nago, the soprano renee fleming was lustily booed by an audience at\\nla scala in milan for her performance in the title role of\\ndonizetti\\'s \"lucrezia borgia.\" it\\'s a juicy story. but it\\'s not\\nquite true.\\n\\nthat night vociferous audience members indeed booed fleming,\\naccording to eyewitnesses. others cheered her. but it\\'s hardly\\nunusual for finicky la scala patrons to break into warring\\nfactions. frustration had built up because the conductor that night\\nhad passed out on the podium and had to take a 30-minute break.\\nfleming\\'s remaining performances during the run passed without\\nincident.\\n\\nin 2000, she proved she could sing this daunting role\\nimpressively in a concert performance with the opera orchestra of\\nnew york at carnegie hall. and on saturday night fleming, who\\ncontinually reassesses her repertory choices, returned to this\\ntouchstone bel canto role at the washington national opera when a\\nnew production, directed and designed by john pascoe and conducted\\nby placido domingo, was introduced at the kennedy center. this was\\nfleming\\'s debut with the company.\\n\\nthough her performance was vocally uneven, whole stretches were\\nsumptuous. making pretty sounds was clearly not her goal. she threw\\nherself into the daunting role, taking enormous vocal risks,\\nsinging with raw intensity and earthy richness, utterly inhabiting\\nthe character of this beautiful, murderous noblewoman in\\nrenaissance italy.\\n\\n\"lucrezia borgia,\" which had its premiere at la scala in 1833,\\nis considered a major donizetti work. yet it has been produced with\\nsurprising infrequency in america. the only metropolitan opera\\nproduction was in 1904, and this was the work\\'s premiere with the\\nwashington company. the score is melodically opulent and\\ndramatically urgent. verdi\\'s \"macbeth\" would have been impossible\\nwithout donizetti\\'s example here.\\n\\nno doubt some opera companies are put off by the story, loosely\\nbased on the historical lucrezia borgia, the daughter of a ruthless\\nmachiavellian nobleman who connived his way into power and,\\neventually, the papacy. in the opera, lucrezia is a femme fatale,\\nmarried to duke alfonso of ferrara. when the opera begins, lucrezia\\nhas tracked down gennaro, a young warrior and her illegitimate son,\\nthough only she knows this. gennaro falls for lucrezia instantly,\\nas things often happen in opera, until he discovers that she is the\\nreviled lucrezia borgia, who willfully poisons rivals in love and\\nin politics.\\n\\nin researching the veiled history of the borgias and examining\\nthe victor hugo tragedy from which the opera is adapted, pascoe has\\ncome to see lucrezia as a determined woman, probably a victim of\\nabuse as a girl, trying to survive in a ferociously masculine world\\nin which revenge and murder become \"the wages of love,\" as he put\\nit in a program note.\\n\\nthis doesn\\'t seem a revelatory take on the opera. after all,\\ndonizetti gives his monstrous heroine some anguished and elegant\\nmusic. even her fiery calls for vengeance are expressed through\\neerie outbursts of coloratura roulades that make lucrezia seem\\ntragically unhinged.\\n\\npascoe\\'s grandly old-fashioned production is spiked with\\ncontemporary psychological twists. towering brick walls frame the\\nset. with sunken dungeons always spewing smoke (for some reason),\\ndecadent party scenes in which drunken young men and women entwine\\nin twos and threes, a menacing prison guard cracking a whip and\\nmore, pascoe certainly evokes the story\\'s sordidness.\\n\\nbut the garishly ornate, cartoonish costumes baffled me.\\npascoe\\'s aim was to depict the period, applying a modern-day\\nsensibility to evoke that aggressively masculine renaissnance\\nsociety. gennaro, sung by the young italian tenor vittorio grigolo,\\nhas punkish blond hair and a tight-fitting, gold-tinged outfit with\\nsci-fi shoulder pads that give him the look of flash gordon. when\\nfleming appears in a dress with a similarly gold-tinged stiff top,\\nshe seems like flash gordon\\'s space princess.\\n\\ngrigolo, who has a thriving side career as a pop star in italy,\\nis a charismatic performer with undeniable audience appeal. his\\nvoice has ping and plaintive colorings. handsome, energetic, able\\nto leap a wall in a single bound, he is a natural onstage. and\\nthere is a comparably athletic quality to his crisp, robust\\nsinging. still, some shakiness and grainy legato suggested that he\\nmay be forcing his voice.\\n\\nsinging lucrezia\\'s manipulative husband, duke alfonso, is the\\nveteran italian bass ruggero raimondi, a great verdi stylist who\\nstill sounded vocally imposing, if a little woolly at times. in a\\nway, the only genuinely romantic relationship is the friendship\\nbetween gennaro and his warrior sidekick maffio orsini, a trouser\\nrole, here sung by kate aldrich, a rich-voiced and dynamic\\nmezzo-soprano.\\n\\npascoe essentially presents these friends as lovers, and in\\nfairness, donizetti\\'s duets for them, when they swear to remain\\ntogether until death, are the opera\\'s most tenderly beguiling\\nmoments. but pascoe makes the homoerotic subtext too overt and\\njarringly hip, by having gennaro and maffio fondle and kiss like\\nhormonal adolescents.\\n\\ndomingo conducted ably, though he sometimes tried so hard to\\naccommodate the singers that the orchestra\\'s execution faltered.\\nstill, this is rightly fleming\\'s show. (sondra radvanovsky will\\nsing three of the remaining six performances.) fleming may not be\\neveryone\\'s ideal of a refined bel canto soprano, but her\\nperformance is smart and honest.\\n\\nsometimes, as she executes an expressive turn or vocal gesture,\\nher voice will become breathy in the middle range or hard-edged on\\nclimactic high notes. but she never compromises her intentions. for\\nthe most part her coloratura passagework is accurate and supple,\\nthough she seemed to tire during her fitful and vocally ornate\\nfinal scene, when lucrezia is mad with grief that her son has been\\nthe inadvertent victim of her latest poisoning plot.\\n\\nthe audience gave fleming a tremendous ovation, with one lone\\nboo, from what i could tell, amid the hearty bravos. you can\\'t\\nplease everybody.\\n\\nprime minister gordon brown of britain on sunday urged persian\\ngulf nations to help bolster the international monetary fund\\'s\\nbailout capacity, as leaders around

369,000 government inspectors.\\n\\nthe aggressive moves come amid growing worries that the animal\\nfeed industry could be contaminated by melamine, endangering the\\nnational food supply and posing a health threat to consumers.\\n\\nin the past week and a half, eggs produced in three provinces\\nwere found to be tainted with high levels of melamine. and in\\nseptember, melamine-tainted infant

number of rogue\\noperators had deliberately added melamine to feed, often using it\\nas cheap filler to save money.\\n\\nthe government response was similarly reassuring early last year\\nwhen several animal feed makers were caught exporting\\nmelamine-tainted feed ingredients to the united states and other\\ncountries, resulting in contaminated pet food supplies that\\nsickened and killed cats and dogs.\\n\\nthat case led to the largest pet food recall in american\\nhistory. melamine dealers in china said in interviews last year and\\nas recently as friday that it was not uncommon for

presidential campaign, the debate over how\\nfuture campaigns will be financed is set to begin in earnest.\\n\\nthe outcome promises to have a profound impact on future\\npresidential runs, either upping the fundraising ante irrevocably\\nor forcing sweeping changes to prevent such large amounts of cash\\nfrom coursing through campaigns again. but just as it has in this\\nelection cycle, it is likely that politics, as much as principle,\\nwill shape the jockeying.\\n\\ndemocrats, in particular, who have traditionally supported\\nlimits on campaign spending, are grappling with whether they can\\nembrace obama\\'s example without being seen as hypocritical. they\\nare keenly aware that they have developed through the internet a\\ncommanding fundraising advantage over republicans, much like the\\ndirect-mail money machine that conservatives used to lord over\\nthem.\\n\\n\"i think there is going to be tremendous reluctance on our side\\nto yield any of that advantage,\" said tad devine, who was a senior\\nstrategist for sen. john f. kerry\\'s presidential campaign in 2004.\\n\\nbob kerrey, the democratic former senator from nebraska who\\nserves as an honorary chairman of a group that fights for public\\nfinancing of federal races, wrote an opinion article in the new\\nyork post last week in which he confessed to new-found ambivalence\\non the issue in light of obama\\'s success among small donors and the\\nenergy he has seen in this year\\'s election.\\n\\nhe said in an interview that part of his change of heart might\\nindeed be related to the existing system\\'s benefits to democrats,\\nand he said he believed many others in his party were wrestling\\nwith the issue anew because of the changed calculus. but he added\\nthat obama\\'s army of small donors had altered the terms of the\\ndebate, causing him to believe that he had been wrong about the\\nneed for such limitations.\\n\\n\"i think the reformers\\' arguments have been substantially\\nundercut by the facts on the ground,\" kerrey said.\\n\\nboth candidates have campaigned as reformers and declared that\\nrestoring the public financing system for presidential campaigns\\nwould be a priority in their administration. but obama apparently\\ndid not absorb much by way of political cost when he broke a pledge\\nto accept public financing if his opponent did as well.\\n\\nobama built a huge financial advantage over the republican\\nnominee, sen. john mccain, which may have written the epitaph for\\nthe current system.\\n\\nan oct. 28 usa today-gallup poll found most americans did not\\neven know who was taking public financing and who was not; only\\nmccain opted for the $84 million in public financing. but the\\nsurvey also found most of those polled supported limits on campaign\\nspending.\\n\\nhouse and senate leadership aides said it was highly unlikely\\nthat the issue would earn much attention next year, given other\\npriorities like the economy and the war in iraq. there is also the\\nmatter of the brewing debate among democrats, who will probably\\ncontrol congress, over whether such limits are even warranted.\\n\\n\"democrats may decide this is working pretty well,\" said rep.\\ndavid price, d-n.c., who last year was the lead sponsor of a\\nmeasure in the house to update the presidential public financing\\nsystem. \"i don\\'t really know what might materialize in the way of\\nviews on our side.\"\\n\\ncampaign finance reform has been a signature cause for mccain,\\nthough he declined in recent years to sponsor bills updating the\\npresidential public financing system.\\n\\nyet if mccain were to win on tuesday, the resistance in\\ndemocratic circles to new financing rules would presumably only\\ngrow as they plot another assault on the republicans\\' white house\\ngrip in 2012.\\n\\nthe existing presidential public financing system began in the\\n1970s after the watergate scandal as a way to limit the influence\\nof money in politics, but it has not kept pace with increased\\nspending. the 2004 race was the first time both major nominees,\\nkerry and president bush, decided to bypass the federal matching\\nfunds for the primary. obama became the first major party candidate\\nto opt out of the system for the general election. such a move\\nallows candidates to raise more money.\\n\\nbut advocates for tighter restrictions on campaign finance said\\nthey were alarmed by the more than $1.5 billion that had been\\nraised by the presidential candidates in this year\\'s primary and\\ngeneral elections -- the first time the presidential aspirants have\\ntopped $1 billion. (the obama campaign raised $640 million, the\\nmccain camp less than $250 million.) the advocates said that they\\nwere poised to begin aggressively lobbying for changes to the\\npublic financing system and that they hoped the issue would be\\ntaken up quickly by the new president and congress.\\n\\nthe bill they are promoting seeks to offer new incentives to\\nparticipate in the public finance system by substantially\\nincreasing the amount of public money available to candidates. its\\nprovisions include increasing the ratio of public matching funds\\navailable in the primary, eliminating state-by-state primary\\nspending limits and increasing the size of the grant for the\\ngeneral election.\\n\\nadvocates for the bill said they were not convinced of obama\\'s\\nargument -- now being embraced by many fellow democrats -- that by\\nraising unprecedented sums from small donors he has addressed the\\nproblem of big-money influence in politics. skeptics note that\\nobama raised record amounts from large donors as well.\\n\\nin addition, they said, this year\\'s presidential campaign\\nhighlighted new issues. among them: megadonors to joint fundraising\\ncommittees that benefit the candidate and the party, as well as\\nquestions about the integrity of internet donations, an issue that\\nhas drawn increasing scrutiny in recent weeks because of the obama\\ncampaign\\'s lucrative online efforts.\\n\\n\"whether we get to move this meaningful campaign reform forward\\nis going to depend largely on the leadership of either obama or\\nmccain,\" said craig holman, a lobbyist for public citizen, a\\nwatchdog group. \"if either one of them decides they don\\'t care,\\nwe\\'re going to have a hard time convincing congress to take up the\\nissue.\"\\n\\nan article of faith among conservative critics of american\\nuniversities has been that liberal professors politically\\nindoctrinate their students. this conviction not only fueled the\\nculture wars but has also led state lawmakers to consider requiring\\ncolleges to submit reports to the government detailing their\\nprogress in ensuring \"intellectual diversity,\" prompted\\nuniversities to establish faculty positions devoted to conservatism\\nand spurred the creation of a network of volunteer watchdogs to\\nmonitor \"political correctness\" on campuses.\\n\\nbut three sets of researchers recently concluded that professors\\nhave virtually no impact on the political views and ideology of\\ntheir students.\\n\\nif there has been a conspiracy among liberal faculty members to\\ninfluence students, \"they\\'ve done a pretty bad job,\" said a. lee\\nfritschler, a professor of public policy at george mason university\\nand an author of the new book \"closed minds? politics and ideology\\nin american universities\" (brookings institution press).\\n\\nthe notion that students are induced to move leftward \"is a\\nfantasy,\" said jeremy d. mayer, another of the book\\'s authors.\\nwhen it comes to shaping a young person\\'s political views, \"it is\\nreally hard to change the mind of anyone over 15,\" said mayer, who\\ndid extensive research on faculty and students.\\n\\n\"parents and family are the most important influence,\"\\nfollowed by the news media and peers, he said. \"professors are\\namong the least influential.\"\\n\\na study of nearly 7,000 students at 38 institutions published in\\nthe current ps: political science and politics, the journal of the\\namerican political science association, as well as a second study\\nthat has been accepted by the journal to run in april 2009, both\\nreach similar conclusions.\\n\\n\"there is no evidence that an instructor\\'s views instigate\\npolitical change among students,\" matthew woessner and april\\nkelly-woessner, a husband-and-wife team of political scientists who\\nhave frequently conducted research on politics in higher education,\\nwrite in that second study.\\n\\nno one disputes that american academia is decidedly more liberal\\nthan the rest of the population, or that there is a detectable\\nshift to the left among students during their college years. still,\\nboth studies in the peer-reviewed ps, for example, found that\\nchanges in political ideology could not be attributed to\\nproselytizing professors but rather to general trends among that\\nage group.\\n\\nthe treasury department has turned down a request by\\ngeneral motors for up to $10 billion to help finance the\\nautomaker\\'s possible merger with chrysler, according to people\\nclose to the discussions.\\n\\ninstead of providing new assistance, the treasury department\\ntold gm on friday, the bush administration will now shift its focus\\nto speeding up the $25 billion loan program for fuel-efficient\\nvehicles approved by congress in september and administered by the\\nenergy department.\\n\\ntreasury officials were said to be reluctant to broaden the $700\\nbillion financial rescue program to include industrial companies or\\nto play a part in a gm-chrysler merger that could cost tens of\\nthousands of jobs.\\n\\nbut it remained unclear whether the officials were also seeking\\nto avoid making any decision that would conflict with the goals of\\na new presidential administration. the democratic candidate, sen.\\nbarack obama, has said in recent days that he supports increasing\\naid to the troubled auto companies, while sen. john mccain has not\\nsaid whether he would support aid beyond the $25 billion.\\n\\nwhile gm and chrysler continue to talk, no deal is expected\\nuntil the government clarifies its role, if any. potential\\ninvestors in the deal have been hesitant to back the merger without\\nfederal assistance.\\n\\ngm\\'s chairman, rick wagoner, had lobbied treasury secretary\\nhenry m. paulson jr. to provide emergency aid to the auto companies\\nunder the bailout program to stabilize the financial markets.\\n\\nthe bush administration is still considering a range of options\\nto aid the detroit automakers, which are losing billions of dollars\\nand rapidly depleting their cash reserves, said auto industry and\\nadministration officials, who did not want to be identified because\\nof the sensitive nature of the discussions.\\n\\nthe first step is to get the energy department to expedite the\\nrelease of the $25 billion in low-interest loans for gm, chrysler\\nand the ford motor co.\\n\\nbeyond that, the administration is also bringing the commerce\\ndepartment into discussions about channeling additional aid to the\\nautomakers.\\n\\nwith auto sales deteriorating to their lowest level in 15 years,\\ndetroit\\'s traditional big three are struggling to stay solvent and\\navoid bankruptcy.\\n\\nthe deepening troubles led gm into merger talks in september\\nwith chrysler\\'s majority owner, the private equity firm cerberus\\ncapital management, and the request to the treasury department for\\nassistance.\\n\\nauto industry executives and analysts said over the weekend that\\nthe loan program is essential to retooling plants and developing\\nvehicles that meet more stringent government fuel-economy mandates.\\n\\ngetting the loans will allow gm, ford and chrysler to redirect\\nmoney already budgeted for cleaner cars to other capital needs.\\n\\n\"the auto companies are clearly running out of cash, and badly\\nin need of more liquidity,\" said david cole, chairman of the\\ncenter for automotive research in ann arbor, mich. \"releasing the\\n$25 billion in loans is a necessary first step.\"\\n\\nthe detroit companies employ more than 200,000 workers in the\\nunited states and provide health care and pensions to more than 1\\nmillion americans. the companies are also a lifeline to thousands\\nof dealers and countless suppliers.\\n\\nsupport for aiding the industry is growing among political\\nleaders in states with heavy automotive employment. last week, the\\ngovernors of michigan, ohio, new york, kentucky, delaware and south\\ndakota wrote a letter to paulson and the federal reserve chairman,\\nben s. bernanke, urging \"immediate action\" to assist the\\nindustry.\\n\\n\"while all sectors of the economy are experiencing difficult\\ntimes, the automotive industry is particularly challenged,\" the\\nletter said. \"as a result, the financial well-being of other major\\nindustries and millions of american citizens are at risk.\"\\n\\ncerberus, which bought chrysler last year for $7.4 billion, has\\nbeen unable to reverse a steady decline in the fortunes at the\\ncompany, the smallest of detroit\\'s big three. while overall auto\\nsales in the united states are down 12.8 percent this year,\\nchrysler\\'s sales have fallen 25 percent, mainly because of its\\nfocus on gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.\\n\\ncerberus has had discussions with the japanese automaker nissan\\nmotor and its french partner, renault, about bringing chrysler into\\ntheir international automotive alliance. but people familiar with\\nthe discussions said cerberus is now focused solely on a potential\\ngm deal.\\n\\nthe depth of the big three\\'s problems will become even more\\nevident this week with the release of october sales figures and\\nthird-quarter earnings announcements by gm and ford.\\n\\nindustry sales fell 26.6 percent in september, but october\\'s\\ntotals could be even worse. the auto research web site edmunds.com\\nforecasts that sales of new vehicles during the month will drop\\nnearly 30 percent from the same period last year.\\n\\nehud olmert, the departing prime minister of israel,\\nannounced a series of measures on sunday in response to a rise in\\nviolence by extremist jewish settlers in the west bank, including a\\nhalt to all direct or indirect government financing of illegal\\noutposts.\\n\\nthe announcement amounted to an acknowledgment that public funds\\nwere still being spent on the outposts, contrary to government\\npolicy and despite a long-standing pledge to the united states to\\nremove at least two dozen settlements immediately.\\n\\nmilitant settlers in the southern west bank clashed over the\\nweekend with israeli soldiers and border police officers who came\\nto remove an illegal home built near the settlement of kiryat arba,\\nadjacent to hebron.\\n\\nsettlers also have damaged palestinian property in the area in\\nrecent days, as part of a policy they call \"price tag,\" in which\\na price is exacted for actions against the outposts by the army or\\nthe police.\\n\\nin the weekly cabinet meeting here, olmert said the overwhelming\\nmajority of jewish settlers were law-abiding citizens. \"but,\" he\\nsaid, \"there is also a not small group of wild people who behave\\nin a way that threatens proper law and governance, not only in the\\nareas in which they live, but also in the overall atmosphere of the\\nstate of israel.\"\\n\\namong the measures olmert proposed for curbing the violence were\\nan increase in law enforcement personnel, arrests and timely\\ntrials; the use of administrative detention and distancing orders\\nagainst settlers who break the law; and a halt to public financing\\nof the illegal outposts.\\n\\nin the west bank not including east jerusalem, there are at\\nleast 120 official settlements with more than 260,000 jewish\\nresidents. most of the international community views all jewish\\nconstruction in the areas conquered by israel in the 1967 war as\\nillegal; the united states regards the settlements as an obstacle\\nto peace.\\n\\na damning 2005 report on the outposts was commissioned, under\\npressure from washington, by ariel sharon, the former israeli prime\\nminister, and was researched and written by talia sasson, a former\\nstate prosecutor. it found widespread collusion among officials in\\nsuccessive governments to spend state funds to build outposts, in\\ncontravention of stated policy and law.\\n\\nasked what sort of government funds were still making their way\\nto the outposts, mark regev, a spokesman for olmert, referred to\\nthe sasson report and the to government financing of settler\\nregional councils in the west bank and said that the government\\nwould \"have to be more careful\" about where the public funds were\\ngoing.\\n\\ndani dayan, the chairman of the yesha council, an umbrella\\norganization that represents all the settlers, attacked olmert\\'s\\nannouncement about financing as \"collective punishment\" and said\\nthat politicians were mounting a campaign of incitement and\\ndemonization against the settlers in advance of the national\\nelections set for feb. 10.\\n\\ndayan said that the only government investment in the outposts\\ntoday was indirect, in the form of the regional council funds,\\nwhich go to services like garbage collection and school buses.\\n\"does this mean that they won\\'t clear the garbage?\" dayan asked,\\nadding that he hoped \"this bad government will be replaced with a\\nbetter one in four months.\"\\n\\n\"what\\'s up, lenny,\" a broker on the floor of the\\nnew york stock exchange says, just before the ringing of the\\npavlovian bell that opens the financial market. lenny answers this\\nmorning bid with the customary response: \"what\\'s up.\"\\n\\nposed less as a sincere inquiry into one\\'s well-being than as a\\npassing nod to another day in the financial scrum, the greeting can\\nalso be interpreted in these uncertain times as a question baldly\\nseeking reassurance: what\\'s up?\\n\\nstocks? hopes? layoffs? blood pressure?\\n\\n      (begin optional trim.)\\n\\nleaving unexplored the phrase\\'s deeper meaning, the two brokers\\nmelt into a blue-coated sea on the main floor of the exchange,\\nwhere the lennys have come to personify the amorphous,\\ntemperamental, life-altering thing called wall street -- an\\nall-encompassing name for the stock market, the economy, your\\n401(k).\\n\\nfrom the balcony above this gladiator\\'s pit, photographers\\ncrouch to capture expressions of joy, of anguish, of bewilderment,\\nthat are then presented as clues to how we should feel -- even\\nthough that broker\\'s frown may reflect nothing more than digestive\\ndisagreement with a wolfed-down fried egg sandwich.\\n\\nnot long ago, a floor broker named danny trimble cocked a finger\\nto his head and placed it against his temple, for reasons unrelated\\nto the market; soon an image of trimble \"shooting\" himself made\\nthe newspapers. no matter that he is not a hedge fund manager, bank\\nceo, or fat cat; no matter that he is just a financial foot soldier\\nfrom jersey, hoarse from shouting at his son\\'s pop warner football\\ngames.\\n\\ntrimble, 41, works at the edge of the exchange\\'s main floor,\\nshoulder-to-shoulder with six other men in a booth the size of an\\nelevator car. not everyone graduated from college, but all are\\nresident scholars of the hurly-burly floor, educated in reading\\nmarkets, hunting for matches and executing buy-and-sell orders.\\nthey are worth their commissions, they say, because they provide\\nthings a computer cannot, things like experience, intuition -- a\\n\"feel.\"\\n\\ncrammed into this booth with no place to sit are mike ackerman,\\npaul davis, billy johnson and nick stratakis, of b and b\\nsecurities; trimble and chris martin, of greywolf equity partners;\\nand ralph roiland, a clerk. scrappy independents, all; no one works\\nfor goldman sachs.\\n\\nstill, when they step onto broad and exchange streets to breathe\\nthe autumn air, they sometimes get blamed for the world\\'s economic\\ncrisis. \"you walk out there and people think you\\'re what\\'s wrong\\nwith this country,\" says martin, father of three, of morristown,\\nn.j.\\n\\nwith the opening of the market imminent, the men in the booth\\nsend instant messages to clients, asking, hoping, for interest in\\ntrading stock. but the volatile activity in recent weeks has\\nunnerved many investors; some respond with noncommittal \"thanks\"\\nand \"i\\'m away from my desk.\"\\n\\nat 9:30 on the dime, the opening bell rings, clanging off the\\ncentury-old walls of white marble, the ceiling of gilded gold.\\nbrokers rush to the center of the floor, where specialists in\\nindividual stocks track the last best data. shouts of \"buy off\\n10,000, pair off 10,000,\" and \"how\\'s marathon?\" feed the low\\nroar of business.\\n\\nafter a while, though, quiet returns. brokers gaze at computer\\nscreens in their booths, some to monitor stocks, some to play\\nvirtual games. in one corner, a man is deciphering a crossword\\npuzzle, while three beside him play cards. the stock exchange has a\\ndifferent rhythm now, its denizens say, because of technological\\nadvances and the shrinking of the once-dominant house firms. it\\'s\\nnot like before.\\n\\nmany of the men, and it\\'s still almost all men, remember the\\ndays when they stood several deep around the specialists, nudging,\\npushing, staying put for several straight hours, shouting\\n\"squad!\" for pages to hustle handwritten notes to clerks on the\\nwings, jockeying at the banks of phones now hanging from hooks like\\nrelics.\\n\\nthose were the days when black humor and practical jokes helped\\nto blow off steam and show affection for comrades.\\n\\nthe one-liners would fly minutes after, say, the space shuttle\\nchallenger went down. a trader would return to work, disfigured,\\nafter a serious car accident to find at his station a toy car,\\nburned and crushed. and he would laugh.\\n\\nbilly johnson, 48, a burly former firefighter from oceanport,\\nn.j., recalls how his floor colleagues helped him to toast his\\napproaching marriage: by ripping his jacket and covering him with\\nshaving cream, perfume and potato chips.\\n\\nthe jokes and put-downs still go on, and lately someone has been\\nbeeping a horn concealed in his jacket. but the humor is not quite\\nas black.\\n\\n\"a lot of that stopped after 9/11,\" says doreen mogavero, 53,\\nan experienced floor broker who points out that ground zero is a\\ncouple of blocks away. \"it wasn\\'t that funny anymore.\"\\n\\ngone too is that loud physicality of the floor. headsets and\\nhand-held computerized pads mean less running around, fewer clerks,\\nsofter voices, a smaller chance for error. those technological\\nadvances have opened the market to just about anyone with a\\ncomputer, making floor trading seem almost quaint. many traders\\nretired rather than change their ways; others got laid off,\\nincluding one now walking through the exchange. selling insurance,\\nsomeone says.\\n\\nof the 1,366 broker\\'s licenses available for an annual fee of\\n$40,000, only 553 are being used. in 2006 there were 3,534 people\\nworking on the floor; today there are 1,273.\\n\\n\"the stress now is the lack of business,\" says benedict willis\\niii, 48, a senior broker who started here in 1982. moments later he\\nis interrupted by applause. it is the sound of a lost job: a floor\\nbroker of 20 years has just been laid off from a major firm, and\\nnow his colleagues are showing their respect.\\n\\n\"they\\'re clapping him off,\" willis says. \"it\\'s the second one\\nthis week.\"\\n\\none of the brokers in that small booth, mike ackerman, leads a\\nscandinavian delegation on a brief tour of the exchange, past\\ncomputer screens flashing red and green, past taped-up photographs\\nof family members, closed baseball stadiums and the lower manhattan\\nskyline when it was intact. as he takes them to the balcony, a\\ndelegate asks a question in halting english: does ackerman feel\\npersonally responsible for the collapsing economy?\\n\\ngood question, answers ackerman, 39, father of three, from\\nbasking ridge, n.j. good question. but -- no.\\n\\nhe and all the people down on that floor are executing trades on\\nbehalf of others, using a hybrid method that combines a computer\\'s\\ntechnology with a human\\'s gut instinct. they do not deal in\\nsubprime mortgages; they do not get golden parachutes. but hey:\\ngood question.\\n\\nthese brokers make money whether the market goes up or down;\\ntheir earnings depend on the volume of trades, and the floor\\naverages 117 million orders a day. still, they prefer north to\\nsouth. \"it\\'s political economics,\" willis explains. \"we want to\\nreassure investors that it\\'s ok to come back.\"\\n\\ntomorrow the market will plummet in the very last minutes.\\nbeaten brokers will repair to bars like bobby van\\'s across the\\nstreet, where the bartenders know their drinks before they\\'ve\\nordered.\\n\\nbut right now the market climbs with every tick toward the 4\\np.m. closing, as though willed to rise by all the lennys now eyeing\\nthe electronic board. up, up,

made his first visit to pakistan for talks with\\ntop political and military leaders. the relationship between\\npakistan and the united states has worsened in recent weeks after a\\nstring of american strikes in pakistan on militant hide-outs.\\n\\npetraeus, credited with turning around the war in iraq, was\\naccompanied by richard a. boucher, the assistant secretary of state\\nfor south

deadly consequences from his side if the\\npakistan military joins washington in opposing him,\" rafiq said.\\n\\ncol. moammar gadhafi, the leader of libya, visited\\nmoscow over the weekend for talks on oil and natural gas deals,\\njust two months after secretary of state condoleezza rice was his\\nguest in libya. the visit here suggested that gadhafi, a one-time\\npariah, is maneuvering to play russia and the united states off\\nagainst each other for commercial and political favors.\\n\\nduring the visit, gadhafi pitched a bedouin tent in a kremlin\\ngarden and invited prime minister vladimir v. putin for tea.\\n\\non sunday, gadhafi flew to belarus for a meeting with president\\nalexsander g. lukashenko, a leader who supported the colonel during\\nhis period of ostracism, visiting libya in 2000. gadhafi was\\nexpected to then visit ukraine before returning to north africa\\nafter his first visit to the region since the fall of the soviet\\nunion.\\n\\ngadhafi, whom former president ronald reagan once famously\\ncalled \"the mad dog of the middle east,\" is well on his way to\\nmending ties with the united states and other western governments\\nafter renouncing terrorism and efforts to build weapons of mass\\ndestruction. the trip showed that he has not closed the door on\\nformer east bloc allies.\\n\\n\"they want to say, \\'look, we have options,\"\\' said alex\\nturkeltaub, a managing director at frontier strategy group, a risk\\nconsultancy firm. \"this is a shot across the bow to the new\\nadministration in washington.\"\\n\\nrussian energy companies have been offering libya sweeping\\ncooperation and investment programs. in a bold offer in july, for\\nexample, gazprom, the russian natural gas monopoly, offered to buy\\nall of libya\\'s natural

something\\nthe untied states would not likely offer, russian authorities are\\nnegotiating to provide libya a civilian nuclear research reactor,\\nthough it was unclear whether the sides reached an

40\\npercent of the european union\\'s gas imports. for now, the north\\nafrican nations of libya and algeria compete with russia to supply\\ngas to southern europe. but russia is toying with forming an\\nopec-style group, the gas exporting countries forum, to eliminate\\nthis competition.\\n\\nat the same time, gazprom has been buying licenses to libyan gas\\nfields in joint ventures with the

been regarded as the\\ncultural, intellectual and artistic heart of pakistan, famous for\\nits poets and writers, its gardens and historic sites left over\\nfrom the mughal empire.\\n\\nthe turmoil sown by militancy may have reached into the capital,\\nislamabad, but it rarely seemed to intrude here among the leafy\\nboulevards that are home to many of pakistan\\'s secular-minded\\nelite.\\n\\nbut in recent weeks, panic has found its way even here, with a\\nseries of small bombs and other threats that offer a measure of\\njust how deeply the fear of militant groups like the taliban has\\npenetrated pakistani society.\\n\\non oct. 7, three small bombs exploded in juice shops in a\\nsprawling, congested neighborhood called garhi shahu. the shops,\\nwhich had gained a reputation as \"dating points,\" offering\\nenclosed booths for young couples to cuddle, were gutted in the\\nblasts. one person was killed, and several others were wounded.\\n\\nan unknown group called tehreek-ul haya, or movement for\\ndecency, claimed responsibility and warned of more attacks against\\n\"centers of immorality\" in the city.\\n\\non oct. 9, shabbir labha, the president of the local traders\\nassociation, received an unsigned handwritten letter that\\nthreatened to bomb lahore\\'s biggest video and music market.\\n\\nthe next day, he got an anonymous phone call asking him if he\\ncould do something about the sale of the pornographic cds and dvds\\nthere. \"i assured the caller that i can,\" labha recalled, sitting\\nin his basement office on a recent afternoon.\\n\\nwithin a day, the traders had handed over more than 60,000\\npornographic videos and burned them in a bonfire as the city\\'s top\\ngovernment officials, the police and a large crowd looked on.\\n\\n\"we were not sure if the threats were made by the taliban or\\nnot,\" labha said. \"but the bomb blasts in garhi shahu had made us\\napprehensive. we didn\\'t want to take any chances.\"\\n\\nthe fact that a single, anonymous letter could inspire such a\\nspectacle surprised many people here. some voiced alarm that the\\ntolerant, liberal outlook of lahore was under attack from\\ntaliban-style moral policing, usually found only in more restive\\ncorners of the country like the north west frontier province.\\nthere, in cities much closer to the tribal areas where many\\nmilitant groups are based, music stores have been attacked\\nrepeatedly by the taliban.\\n\\nbut in lahore, the capital of punjab province, the music and\\nvideo market on hall road was famous for the sale of english and\\nindian movies, as well as a thriving underground trade in\\npornographic movies, which are illegal here. the small stores in\\ndingy, clustered plazas had attracted buyers for more than two\\ndecades.\\n\\ndespite repeated crackdowns and warnings, the police had been\\nunable to stop the trade in pornography. but the specter of the\\ntaliban achieved in a day what the police had been unable to do for\\nyears.\\n\\nahmad rafay alam, a columnist for the news, one of the country\\'s\\nleading daily publications, wrote afterward that the\\n\"talibanization of lahore has begun.\"\\n\\n\"i was very surprised,\" said moonis elahi, a member of the\\nprovincial assembly, referring to the response of the traders, who\\nhe said were less concerned about making a stand than about saving\\ntheir livelihoods.\\n\\n\"the traders wanted to pacify the extremists,\" he said.\\n\\nsince then, the lingering threat of bomb blasts and suicide\\nattacks continues to sow fear, though many of the letters and the\\ncalls have proved to be hoaxes. elahi said a close friend was so\\nfed up with threats to a school that his child attended that he was\\ncontemplating a move to dubai, in the united arab emirates.\\n\\npolice officials, however, dismissed the concerns of\\n\"talibanization\" as overblown and played down the threats. \"in\\nour assessment the letter was a hoax,\" said pervez rathore, the\\npolice chief of lahore. \"it was a local mischief.\"\\n\\nin addition to fear, the hall road episode has exposed fissures\\nin society in lahore, between the city\\'s liberal elite and the\\nconservative impulses of its working and middle classes, some of\\nwhom have excused or supported the threats and the traders\\'\\nresponse.\\n\\nejaz haider, an editor at daily times, one of the leading\\nenglish-language newspapers, said the burning of the cds did not\\nnecessarily mean that the hall road traders had become reformed\\nmuslims overnight. \"it just showed the pragmatism of the\\ntraders,\" he said.\\n\\nkhalil rehman chugtai, the secretary of the traders\\' union of\\nhall road, said the threats were in fact a blessing. \"we had been\\ntrying to eliminate the sales of porn movies for long with no\\nluck,\" he said. \"the letter helped us to get rid of them.\"\\n\\nchugtai said there would now be no tolerance for the sale of\\nsuch \"immoral movies.\" a few days after the bonfire, he said, one\\nvideo store owner was found selling pornography again. \"we\\napprehended him, blackened his face and paraded him through the\\nmarket,\" he said.\\n\\nsaeed ahmad, who owns a juice shop near the three that were\\nattacked last month, even defended the bomb blasts.\\n\\n\"what happened was for the better,\" he said. \"they didn\\'t\\njust serve juices there. immoral acts were going on inside the\\ncabins set up by the owners, who took money from couples.\"\\n\\nstill, raza ahmad rumi, a writer and blogger who takes great\\npride in his city, insisted that \"islamic extremism has had very\\nlittle appeal here.\" the cultural life of lahore goes on, as it\\nhas for centuries.\\n\\nhe said that a recent stage play, \"hotel moenjodaro,\" whose\\ntheme was against religious fundamentalism, drew a packed audience.\\n\"it was very encouraging,\" ahmad said.\\n\\nnonetheless, he said, the hall road incident and the juice store\\nblasts were alarming. \"if the traders, the merchant class, which\\nforms the bulk of the middle class of lahore, becomes talibanized,\\nthen the whole complexion of the city will change,\" he said.\\n\"that\\'s a fear amongst the secular intelligentsia and elite of\\nlahore.\"\\n\\nin 1967, after several years of research, a young market\\nforecaster named yale hirsch unveiled a grand theory of the\\nrelationship between presidential elections and the stock market.\\n\\ntracking data back to 1833, hirsch found that on average, stocks\\nperformed better in the final two years of a presidential term, a\\ntrend he attributed to maneuvering by the party in power to better\\nits chances of re-election.\\n\\n\"as presidents and their parties get anxious about holding on\\nto power, they begin to prime the pump in the third year, fostering\\nbull markets, prosperity and peace,\" reads a recent edition of the\\n\"stock trader\\'s almanac,\" the venerable perennial founded by\\nhirsch that collects financial tidbits, gentle market humor and\\nreams of historical data.\\n\\nbut as with its older cousin in the almanac business, poor\\nrichard\\'s, the pattern described in the book has not always panned\\nout. with the dow jones industrial average down 30 percent this\\nyear, it would seem 2008 is going to be such a year.\\n\\na decline so startling might suggest that predicting the market\\nby watching american election patterns is not a practice to, er,\\nput a lot of stock in. hirsch\\'s theory, however, was only an early\\nentry in a long tradition of market watchers seeking connections\\nbetween two of america\\'s favorite pastimes: picking presidents and\\npicking stocks.\\n\\nmany analysts, looking for a jump on tuesday\\'s results, have\\npointed out that declines in the stock market right before a\\npresidential election generally point to an advantage for the\\nchallenging party.\\n\\ninvestors looking to make a quick buck this week can dig up\\nresearch showing that stocks tend to do better the day after a\\nrepublican presidential victory than a democratic one. and bullish\\ntypes expecting a barack obama victory have noted that over time,\\nstocks perform better under democratic administrations.\\n\\nor, perhaps, there is no connection at all.\\n\\nwithout doubt, declines in the stock market can signal broader\\nproblems in the economy, and the performance of the economy\\ninfluences how people vote. but to forecast the market based on a\\npolitical event is to enter the murky realm of distinguishing\\nchance correlations from true cause and effect.\\n\\n\"to me, things like the weather, the super bowl and\\npresidential elections are basically coincidental,\" said laszlo\\nbirinyi jr., an investment adviser and head of birinyi associates\\nin westport, conn.\\n\\n\"i would never consider it in terms of investment\\ndecision-making,\" he said. \"you will find people who will wax\\nrhapsodically on it, but quite frankly to me, it\\'s an exercise in\\nfutility.\"\\n\\nwith stocks facing their worst declines in decades, this year\\nmay be particularly difficult to predict. some investors say the\\nproblems in the economy are so far-reaching that the winner of the\\nelection could, in the short-term at least, hardly matter at all.\\n\\n\"the amount of attention being paid to the election is less\\nthan it would be under more normal circumstances,\" said russ\\nkoesterich, a strategist at barclays global investors. \"right now,\\npeople are still focused on gaining clarity about the solvency of\\nthe financial sector.\"\\n\\nsharp differences divide the candidates on matters like tax\\npolicy and government regulation, and their proposals could\\neventually be enacted into law. but birinyi noted that campaign\\nspeeches are far removed from the hurdles and compromises of\\ncapitol hill.\\n\\n\"the process of legislative government is so long and drawn\\nout,\" he said. \"to isolate the issue and the impact is, to me, to\\ntry to find the function of a bay leaf in a recipe of coq au vin.\"\\n\\nsome investors expect the market to stay focused on the problems\\nin the economy, including the credit freeze and rising corporate\\nlayoffs. \"the market realizes that whoever comes into the\\nadministration, it\\'s not going to have much of an impact on growth\\nover the next couple of quarters,\" koesterich said.\\n\\ndespite the cautions of such sober analysts as koesterich, it is\\ndifficult for people to resist looking for patterns that supposedly\\npredict the future.\\n\\njeremy j. siegel, a professor at the wharton school, studied\\npresidential election cycles for his 1994 book, \"stocks for the\\nlong run,\" and found that when a republican wins a presidential\\nelection, stocks tend to perform better the day after.\\n\\nsiegel attributed that to the relatively conservative leanings\\nof the investor class. \"the first flush is, \\'the republicans won;\\ni\\'m happy,\"\\' he said. \"but once it plays out, the democrats in\\nthe long run have had historically better returns.\"\\n\\nsiegel studied stock returns from 1888 to 2004. from monday to\\nwednesday of presidential election weeks, stocks moved higher by an\\naverage of 0.7 percent in the event of a republican victory. stocks\\nfell 0.5 percent on average when the democrats took the white\\nhouse.\\n\\nthe study, which used the standard &amp;amp; poor\\'s index as a gauge,\\ncomes with caveats. in the postwar election years, from 1948 to\\n2004, the average return on a republican victory was zero, while\\nstocks dropped 0.2 percent on democratic victories. stocks also\\ntended to do better when the branches of government were divided\\nbetween the parties, with the best performance under a democratic\\npresident and republican congress.\\n\\nbut on a longer time scale, much of a president\\'s legacy -- at\\nleast that part of his legacy measured by the dow jones industrial\\naverage -- has really been determined by \"whether markets are high\\nor low when you came into office, not what sorts of policies you\\nbring in to spark it up,\" siegel said.\\n\\nand what of hirsch\\'s theory of presidential elections? hirsch\\ndeclined to be interviewed. but his son, jeffrey, who has taken the\\nreins of the business, defended the theory.\\n\\n\"the advantage of the cycle is it works most of the time, and\\nit provides you an overarching theme as to when most of the\\nmarkets\\' gains and losses are made,\" the younger hirsch said.\\n\\n\"nothing\\'s 100 percent perfect,\" he added. \"it\\'s not\\nsomething used in a vacuum. it\\'s not that you look at the stars and\\nthe calendar, and only follow that.\"\\n\\nand his thoughts for 2009? \"next year might not be as bad. or,\\nconversely, there\\'s something horrible going on, something negative\\nin this global crisis, which could mean next year will be even more\\ndifficult.\"\\n\\nif sen. john mccain defies the polls and wins\\npennsylvania, it will be in part because of voters like harry\\nklemash, 67, a democrat who supported sen. hillary rodham clinton\\nin the primary and is still not comfortable with sen. barack obama.\\n\\n\"obama has too many socialist policies, and he doesn\\'t have\\nenough experience,\" klemash, a retired pressman, said sunday as he\\nwalked his miniature poodle in marconi park in south philadelphia,\\na largely white, catholic, ethnic neighborhood.\\n\\nwith the presidential election a day away, the polls point to an\\nobama victory in pennsylvania, with obama holding a big lead in\\nphiladelphia. but the polls are tightening, and mccain has shown no\\nsigns of letting up in the state.\\n\\nas the republicans try to map situations in which mccain could\\npull off an upset, they are focusing on philadelphia\\'s mostly white\\nenclaves.\\n\\n\"i\\'m spending a lot of time in philadelphia,\" said robert\\ngleason, the chairman of the state republican party.\\n\\n\"we\\'re working the northeast,\" he said, referring to a largely\\nwhite part of the city. \"we\\'ve got values voters up there,\\ncatholics. my people up there say they can carry four to six wards\\nthis year, and four years ago, they carried none.\"\\n\\nwhile wealthier whites in philadelphia, especially in center\\ncity, overwhelmingly support obama, some blue-collar democrats\\nnever made the transition from supporting clinton. in south\\nphiladelphia, mccain signs have cropped up in the windows of the\\nlow brick houses and on the postage-stamp lawns.\\n\\n\"hillary won some of those white wards by 10-1,\" said shanin\\nspecter, son of sen. arlen specter, r-pa., and a lawyer who is\\nsteeped in local politics. \"obama is likely to significantly\\nunderperform kerry and gore in those white row-house wards.\"\\n\\nthe obama campaign is fully aware of the challenge.\\n\\n\"this is a tough ward,\" said paul rossi, 61, a data processor\\nwho lives in the neighborhood and is helping out at an obama office\\nthat opened saturday not far from marconi park. \"it\\'s a matter of\\nconvincing people culturally that they won\\'t be harmed by obama.\"\\n\\nit is no accident that sen. joe biden, obama\\'s running mate, is\\nbeing dispatched to speak in marconi park on monday night for his\\nfinal rally of the campaign. the white, blue-collar catholics here\\nare just the kind of voters whom biden, also catholic, was chosen\\nto help win over. biden is to be joined by members of the\\nphiladelphia phillies, who just won the world series.\\n\\nsusan streicher, 59, a retired secretary and registered\\ndemocrat, acknowledged that biden\\'s catholicism was appealing to\\nher but said she preferred mccain and gov. sarah palin, mccain\\'s\\nrunning mate, because they oppose abortion rights. her husband,\\njohn, 63, a postal worker, dismissed mccain, saying that he was a\\n\"warmonger\" and that alaska, palin\\'s home state, \"is all\\nwilderness.\" both said they thought obama would win.\\n\\nthere is no doubt that obama, who won philadelphia in the\\nprimary, will sweep the city again. but while it is a major part of\\nthe statewide puzzle, it is still only a piece.\\n\\nin 2004, sen. john kerry, the democrat, won about 80 percent of\\nthe vote in philadelphia, beating president bush by 412,000 votes\\nhere. but kerry won the state by only 144,000 votes.\\n\\ngov. edward g. rendell of pennsylvania said sunday that although\\nhe still expected obama to win the state, he was \"nervous\" and\\nhad been on the phone \"screaming at chicago,\" meaning the obama\\nheadquarters, to send reinforcements. hillary clinton is due in\\npittsburgh on monday; former president bill clinton is to stump for\\nobama in erie and elsewhere the same day.\\n\\nmccain continues to devote his most precious resource, his time,\\nto pennsylvania. he made three in-person pleas to voters in the\\neastern part of the state over the weekend and planned a final,\\nshort rally for monday at the pittsburgh airport.\\n\\nalthough mccain has paid scant attention to philadelphia,\\ngleason, the republican state chairman, said mccain hoped to do\\nbetter in the city than bush did, and the party has begun running\\nadvertisements highlighting obama\\'s ties to the rev. jeremiah a.\\nwright jr., his former pastor, which could tap into concerns among\\nwhite voters.\\n\\n\"in south philadelphia,\" gleason said, \"with the battle\\nbetween the african-americans and all the other wards, we can keep\\nobama under a 400,000 margin in philadelphia.\" (he added with a\\nlaugh, \"i get a big salary to be positive.\")\\n\\nrendell agreed that because of the white wards, obama might get\\na smaller percentage of the philadelphia vote than kerry did,\\nperhaps 75 percent instead of kerry\\'s 80 percent. but with\\nadditional democratic registrations, he said, and a bigger turnout,\\nobama would exceed kerry\\'s numbers.\\n\\nin addition, rendell said, mccain could not rely on the\\nrepublicans\\' deepest well in the state, which, until 1992, had been\\nthe four suburban counties around philadelphia. rendell and gleason\\nagreed that montgomery county, the most affluent and liberal of the\\nfour, would vote for obama, and that bucks and delaware counties\\nwere also likely to swing for him. the fourth, chester county, is\\nclosely contested.\\n\\nelsewhere in the state, mccain needs a big turnout in central\\npennsylvania and is making an incursion into the scranton area. in\\ncounterpoint to mccain\\'s appeal there to catholic democrats, the\\nobama team on sunday sent in caroline kennedy.\\n\\ndespite the frenzied last-minute campaigning and polls\\nsuggesting a tighter race, g. terry madonna, a political analyst at\\nfranklin &amp;amp; marshall college in lancaster, said he expected obama to\\nwin the state by at least seven points.\\n\\nas part of the obama campaign\\'s highly organized\\nget-out-the-vote operation, scores of volunteers were hustling in\\nand out of the new branch office here on sunday.\\n\\nmany were from out of state, including two women from new york\\nwho said they had expected to be sent to more rural environs and\\nwere surprised when they were sent to philadelphia.\\n\\n\"we thought, oh, it\\'s an urban area, it\\'s done,\" said marian\\nmasone, 57, a film curator who lives in brooklyn.\\n\\nthey said they were also surprised by the negative reaction to\\nthem in south philadelphia. masone and her friend, eileen newman,\\n62, who works in film management and lives in manhattan, said that\\nsome people said \"no way\" to them about obama and that one told\\nthem, \"get off this block.\"\\n\\nas for klemash, the south philadelphia resident, he said he was\\nambivalent about mccain, too. \"mccain is too close to bush,\" he\\nsaid, yet he admires mccain\\'s military service. then again, he\\nsaid, palin was a bad choice as mccain\\'s running mate because she\\ndoes not have enough experience. but then again, he said, obama\\ndoes not have enough experience, either.\\n\\nhis conclusion: \"this is a really hard election.\"\\n\\nwhy auto industry is worth saving\\n\\n\\n\\n      analysts: big 3 woes imperil u.s. economy\\n\\n      by alisa priddle\\n\\n      the detroit news\\n\\nthe auto industry employs hundreds of thousands in michigan, but\\nits reach is broader than that.\\n\\nabout 3.1 million people work for automakers, parts suppliers\\nand their related businesses in the united states.\\n\\nevery direct job at an automaker in the u.s. creates five more\\njobs, said sean mcalinden, chief economist and vice president for\\nresearch for the center for automotive research in ann arbor. two\\nof the five are related to suppliers and dealers; the other three\\nare spinoff jobs at businesses where auto industry workers spend\\ntheir paychecks.\\n\\nby contrast, one wall street position creates about 2.5 jobs,\\nmcalinden said. congress expedited aid to the financial services\\nindustry this year. the next closest industry to autos is high\\ntech, responsible for a total of four jobs, including spinoffs, he\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"the cost benefit to the economy (of helping automakers) is\\nbetter than any individual buyout offered on wall street,\"\\nmcalinden said.\\n\\nno other industry in america has as broad and significant an\\nimpact -- even with the restructuring by detroit\\'s big three\\nautomakers in recent years that has closed factories and cost tens\\nof thousands of jobs, mcalinden said.\\n\\nthat\\'s why michigan politicians, union leaders, auto executives\\nand governors from five other states are lobbying for federal aid\\nfor the industry, saying the help is necessary to prevent huge job\\nlosses from a bankruptcy or collapse of one or more of detroit\\'s\\nautomakers.\\n\\nimportant despite problems\\n\\nthey\\'re lobbying to get a piece of the u.s. treasury\\ndepartment\\'s $700 billion fund to help salvage the economy, or\\nother aid, as well as accelerate and possibly expand the $25\\nbillion loan program approved to help automakers modernize their\\nfactories to build more fuel-efficient models.\\n\\ndeclining auto sales have contributed to the nation\\'s economic\\ndownturn, but that hasn\\'t diminished the industry\\'s importance,\\nsaid charles chesbrough, senior economist for csm worldwide in\\nnorthville, an automotive market research firm.\\n\\n\"we won\\'t see a turnaround in the economy as a whole,\" he\\nsaid, \"until we see improvement in the auto industry.\"\\n\\nthe importance of the auto sector will be underscored this week\\nwhen car plans to release a new analysis of the impact on the\\neconomy if operations cease at any of the big three. mcalinden said\\nthe resulting drop in tax income and other losses over three years\\nwould far exceed the amount being sought in government aid. jobs\\nare tied to everything from buying a car to washing it and refining\\nthe gas that fuels it, and more than 14 million u.s. workers --\\nabout 1 in 10 -- can draw a line from their job back to an auto\\nfactory or office worker, according to c a r .\\n\\nminimum of 5 million jobs\\n\\nin a letter to treasury secretary henry paulson and federal\\nreserve chairman ben bernanke, gov. jennifer granholm and five\\nother governors said automakers in the u.s. directly employ about\\n355,000 workers. the nation has 783,100 people who make parts for\\nautomakers, either for installation at the factory or for sale in\\nthe aftermarket, which includes accessories and repair parts, said\\ndebbie maranger menk, project manager for car. they work in all 50\\nstates, including nine in alaska and 145,000 in michigan, she said.\\n\\neach of those supplier jobs has its own substantial trickle-down\\neffect. another 1.97 million workers produce the steel, rubber and\\nother materials needed to make the parts, or provide engineering,\\ndistribution and other support services -- bringing the total to\\n2.76 million employees with jobs tied to suppliers. the spinoff\\neffect then spills into stores and restaurants relying on the\\nincome of this pool of workers.\\n\\n\"there are 1.7 million people who owe their jobs to the fact\\nthe 2.7 million have jobs,\" menk said, equaling 4.4 million just\\non the supplier side. factoring in some overlap in the retail\\nspinoff from each supplier and automaker job, she estimates total\\nemployment in the auto industry at a minimum of 5 million jobs.\\n\\nshe describes car\\'s figures, which are based on a study released\\nearlier this year that used 2006 data, the most recent available,\\nas conservative. they are significantly lower than figures used by\\neast lansing-based anderson economic group. senior consultant ilhan\\ngeckil said anderson estimated the number of jobs provided by\\nautomakers, suppliers, dealers and aftermarket companies, and the\\nresulting spinoff jobs amounted to 8.7 million as of 2006.\\n\\nbig 3\\'s clout slipping away\\n\\nadmittedly, the auto sector has lost some clout. sales are down\\n13 percent so far this year, following year-end declines of 3.6\\npercent in 2006 and 2.9 percent in 2007.\\n\\nafter years of contributing about 5 percent of the country\\'s\\ngross domestic product, or gdp, the figure dropped to 2.9 percent\\nat the end of 2007 and is trending around 2.5 percent now of the\\n$14.5 trillion total, said dana johnson, chief economist for\\ncomerica bank in dallas. johnson paints a dramatically different\\npicture of the value of the auto industry nationwide, saying the\\nsector accounts for less than 1 percent of jobs and that the adage\\nof \\'what\\'s good for gm is good for the country,\\' is no longer the\\ncase. it is good for michigan and select states, he said, but not\\nthe u.s. as a whole.\\n\\nautos are a key sector within manufacturing, but johnson said\\nmanufacturing accounts for only about 10 percent of american jobs\\ncompared with 30 percent decades ago.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t believe the auto sector deserves special\\nconsideration,\" johnson said . bailing out financial institutions\\nwas necessary to prevent \"terrible contagion effects that could\\ncollapse the economy,\" johnson said. \"that should be the\\nstandard. to argue national prosperity depends on them (automakers)\\noperating, to me, is much more of a stretch.\"\\n\\n\\'black eye on the economy\\'\\n\\nit\\'s not to those who have seen detroit\\'s big three eliminate\\nmore than 100,000 jobs the past three years.\\n\\nallowing an

automakers also buy $15 billion a year in advertising\\n, not counting the huge amount dealers spend.\\n\\nautomakers spend more on research and development than any other\\nindustry except the government, about $18.5 billion a year,\\nmcalinden said, with 85 percent of that done in michigan.\\n\\nboth presidential candidates have energy policies and tax\\nincentives for fuel-saving research that cannot be achieved without\\na healthy and robust auto industry, csm\\'s chesbrough said. \"the\\nauto sector is key to where the country needs to go in the future\\nto reduce oil dependence,\"

killer diseases on other things\\nand has failed to honor requests to return the money, according to\\nthe organization\\'s inspector general.\\n\\nthe actions by zimbabwe have deprived the organization, the\\nglobal fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria, of resources\\nit needs and damaged efforts to expand lifesaving treatment, said\\nthe inspector general, john parsons. zimbabwe\\'s actions also\\njeopardize a more ambitious $188 million global fund grant to\\nzimbabwe, due for consideration by the fund\\'s board on friday,\\nparsons said.\\n\\nthe global fund has continued to demand that zimbabwe return the\\nmoney, and global fund officials say zimbabwean financial officials\\nhave promised to do so by thursday. but parsons said zimbabwean\\nofficials also said they had not repaid the money because they did\\nnot have enough foreign currency.\\n\\nthe breakdown of trust between the global fund and the\\ngovernment of zimbabwe comes at a moment of widening humanitarian\\ncrisis and casts further doubt on the willingness of western donors\\nto invest heavily in rebuilding the economically broken nation as\\nlong as mugabe is in charge, even if a deadlock over a\\npower-sharing government is resolved. parsons said in an interview\\non sunday that last year the global fund deposited $12.3 million in\\nforeign currency into zimbabwe\\'s reserve bank. he declined to\\nspeculate on how the $7.3 million it was seeking to be returned had\\nbeen spent, except to say it was not on the intended purpose. civic\\ngroups and opposition officials maintain that the reserve bank\\nhelps finance mugabe\\'s patronage machine.\\n\\nparsons did offer an example of the human consequences of the\\nreserve bank\\'s failure to hand over the money for disease fighting.\\nthe global fund has brought in large quantities of medicines that\\ncan cure malaria, but has been able to finance the training of only\\n495 people to distribute them safely instead of the planned 27,000.\\nthere were 2.7 million cases of malaria among zimbabwe\\'s 12 million\\npeople in the world health organization\\'s most recent estimates.\\n\\n\"the drugs expire by

director clare kilner as \"a female\\n\\'superbad\"\\' -- schneider plays curtzman, the entrepreneur behind a\\n\"girls gone wild\"-type franchise called \"chicks go crazy.\"\\njenna dewan (\"step up\") plays priscilla, the virgin in the film\\'s\\ntitle, who after a night of drunken debauchery finds herself on one\\nof curtzman\\'s tapes and then teams with naz, her wild-child\\nroommate played by brianne davis, to track down the tape.\\n\\nembracing detroit\\n\\nthe $4-million movie, which will be filmed entirely in metro\\ndetroit and has a crew that\\'s 90-percent local, began shooting in\\ngreektown last week. filming continues for the next few weeks,\\nthough schneider is scheduled to wrap his scenes on tuesday.\\n\\nthe film\\'s producers began scouting locations here in april and\\nreturned in june, ultimately choosing detroit over a short list of\\nfour other cities. the original plan was to have greektown stand in\\nfor new orleans, though the script was eventually rejiggered to\\ntake place in detroit. that\\'s why the film, originally titled\\n\"virgin on bourbon street,\" is currently untitled, and using the\\nworking title \"american virgin.\"\\n\\n\"i hate shooting one location for another. so i thought, \\'this\\nis detroit, let\\'s embrace it,\"\\' says kilner (\"how to deal,\"\\n\"the wedding date\"), during a lunch break last week at

curious onlookers strolled by the set\\n. schneider is familiar to audiences from his work on \"saturday\\nnight live\" where he played rich, the \"making copies\" guy, on\\nfilms such as \"deuce bigalow: male gigolo,\" \"the animal\" and in\\nmost adam sandler comedies. (he usually shows up to perform some\\nvariation on the line, \"you can do eet!\"). taking a break from\\nfilming on thursday, he was serenaded with a \"you can do eet!\"\\nfrom a local passerby, and he groused half-kiddingly, \"i\\'ve never\\nheard that.\"\\n\\nschneider, who joked he\\'s approachable because he\\'s the same\\nsize on tv as he is in person, praised the work of the local\\nextras. \"(in l.a.) they could yawn if they see tom cruise walking\\ndown the street, but here, people are really excited. they couldn\\'t\\nhave been nicer.\"\\n\\nsex and sexuality\\n\\nthe film deals frankly with sex and sexuality; but, the\\nfilmmakers say, tries not to take a hard-line stance on the \"girls\\ngone wild\"-ization of american culture. dewan\\'s priscilla is a\\nprudish virgin who wears a purity ring, and davis\\' naz opens the\\nfilm engaged in a foursome; yet the filmmakers say the movie tries\\nnot to judge either of them.\\n\\n\"i\\'d hate for a film to be judgmental or come across with a\\nmoral position, but i guess my point of view is anything extreme is\\nkind of repressing in some way,\" says england-born director\\nkilner. \"women are in charge of their sexuality and celebrating\\nit, but there\\'s a fine line between celebrating it and making your\\nown choices and being exploited, and this is what this film\\nexplores.\"\\n\\ndavis, who plays the party gal, says the film\\'s message is\\nsimple: \"be who you are. not what people want you to be, not a\\ntrend or a part of a movement. just who you are.\"\\n\\nall of which seems like a surprising amount of depth for a film\\nwhere the prop department worked up a license plate that reads \"c\\nboobz.\"\\n\\nschneider -- whose character is loosely modeled after \"girls\\ngone wild\\'s\"

fuel-efficient\\nvehicles approved by congress in september and administered by the\\nenergy department.\\n\\ntreasury officials were said to be reluctant to broaden the $700\\nbillion financial rescue program to include industrial companies or\\nto play a part in a gm-chrysler merger that could cost tens of\\nthousands of jobs.\\n\\nbut it remained unclear whether the officials were also seeking\\nto avoid making any decision that would conflict with the goals of\\na new presidential administration. the democratic candidate, sen.\\nbarack obama, has said in recent days that he supports increasing\\naid to the troubled auto companies, while sen. john mccain has not\\nsaid whether he would support aid beyond the $25 billion.\\n\\nwhile gm and chrysler continue to talk, no deal is expected\\nuntil the government clarifies its role, if any. potential\\ninvestors in the deal have been hesitant to back the merger without\\nfederal assistance.\\n\\ngm\\'s chairman, rick wagoner, had lobbied treasury secretary\\nhenry m. paulson jr. to provide emergency aid to the auto companies\\nunder the bailout program to stabilize the financial markets.\\n\\nthe bush administration is still considering a range of options\\nto aid the detroit automakers, which are losing billions of dollars\\nand rapidly depleting their cash reserves, said auto industry and\\nadministration officials, who did not want to be identified because\\nof the sensitive nature of the discussions.\\n\\nthe first step is to get the energy department to expedite the\\nrelease of the $25 billion in low-interest loans for gm, chrysler\\nand the ford motor co.\\n\\nwith auto sales deteriorating to their lowest level in 15 years,\\ndetroit\\'s traditional big three are struggling to stay solvent and\\navoid bankruptcy.\\n\\nsupport for aiding the industry is growing among political\\nleaders in states with heavy automotive employment. last week, the\\ngovernors of michigan, ohio, new york, kentucky, delaware and south\\ndakota wrote a letter to paulson and the federal reserve chairman,\\nben s. bernanke, urging \"immediate action\" to assist the\\nindustry.\\n\\nthe depth of the big three\\'s problems will become even more\\nevident this week with the release of october sales figures and\\nthird-quarter earnings announcements by gm and ford.\\n\\nher crowds are smaller now, and most of the\\nreporters are gone. the campaign posters say his name, not hers.\\nand instead of championing her ideas for health insurance or tax\\nrelief, sen. hillary rodham clinton is giving out 1-800 numbers and\\ninternet addresses for sen. barack obama\\'s campaign.\\n\\nwatching clinton campaign for her old rival, masking what\\nfriends say is lingering disappointment, it is easy to recall\\nhappier days. while she often said, during her 17-month race, that\\nit took \"a clinton to clean up after a bush,\" she has now tweaked\\nthat line a bit.\\n\\n\"it took a democratic president to clean up after the first\\npresident bush,\" she said to cheers at a rally here on saturday in\\nthe political battleground of central florida. \"it will take a\\ndemocratic president to clean up after the next president bush!\"\\n\\nmoments later, she made another comment that echoed a clinton\\ncampaign advertisement that ran on the eve of the pennsylvania\\nprimary in which clinton warned voters not to \"take a leap of\\nfaith\" with obama to protect the country.\\n\\nbut for the crowd in winter park, clinton had this to say: \"i\\'m\\nnot asking anyone to take a leap of faith, i\\'m just saying, look at\\nthe evidence,\" arguing that obama\\'s economic proposals were far\\nbetter than mccain\\'s.\\n\\nthe bitterness of that long primary battle, however, is the last\\nthing that obama supporters brought up about clinton in florida\\nlast weekend. of 20 interviewed, all effusively praised her. all 20\\nsaid that if obama won, they hoped that she would be his secretary\\nof state or that she would shepherd his health care or energy bills\\nthrough the senate. all 20 said they hoped she would run for\\npresident again.\\n\\n\"i would have supported her this year if not for her vote for\\nthe iraq war and the fact that she never said it was a mistake,\"\\nsaid jocelyn bartkevicius, a democrat and writer and editor who\\nattended the rally here. \"but she has been so strong for obama\\nthis fall, such a good sport. i wouldn\\'t hold a long-term grudge.\\ni\\'d be with her next time.\"\\n\\nfor the friends and allies already thinking about clinton\\'s\\npolitical future, the possibility of a victory by sen. john mccain\\non tuesday would upend an array of assumptions, not least of which\\nthat clinton -- if she were to run again -- would not do so until\\n2016, when she would be turning 69. at the same time, under a\\nmccain presidency, clinton could be well positioned, given her\\nfriendship with him and good standing among washington republicans,\\nto help him with a democratic-led congress on alternative energy,\\nwhich they have both highlighted on the campaign trail.\\n\\nwhile clinton\\'s high profile in democratic politics has been\\nfortified by her work for obama, her friends say it is too soon to\\nsay what the future holds for her. for one thing, they say, she is\\nnot over her primary loss: some days it is hard for her, even a\\nlittle heart-breaking, to campaign for obama, given how much she\\nwanted to be president.\\n\\nothers say that she is being a good soldier because she wants to\\nbe a power player in washington if obama wins but that she is not\\nsure what her role might be. \"she is a human being,\" said jill\\niscol, a good friend and former supporter of clinton. \"she\\'s a\\nreal person, and so she has her feelings, but what matters to her\\nmost right now is making sure obama wins.\"\\n\\nclinton told fox news last month that there was \"probably\\nzero\" chance of her becoming senate majority leader. several\\nsenate democratic aides concur, noting that many of her colleagues\\nsupported obama for president. asked about the chances that she\\nwould run again for president, she said, \"probably close to\\nzero.\" (the question was not predicated on whether obama would win\\nor lose on tuesday.) supreme court nominee? \"zero,\" she said. \"i\\nhave no interest in doing that.\"\\n\\nwhile clinton still has a campaign debt of several million\\ndollars, she has been steadily raising money for her political\\naction committee, which advisers say could become a means to\\nchampion women\\'s issues.\\n\\nclinton won about 17 million votes in her presidential primary\\ncampaign, and by all accounts she will emerge on election day as a\\nrespected force in the eyes of not only her allies but also of\\npeople around obama, for whom she has raised several million\\ndollars and done more than 75 rallies, fundraisers, conference\\ncalls and other tasks.\\n\\n\"it\\'s one of those times where she has won by losing, in a very\\nreal sense,\" said sen. charles e. schumer, her democratic\\ncolleague from new york. \"whether people were with her, like i\\nwas, or not with her, i think everyone\\'s respect for her in the\\nsenate has gone up in the way she has handled herself since the end\\nof the race.\"\\n\\nover the long term, some political allies believe that clinton\\nwould be a strong choice to lead the democratic senatorial campaign\\ncommittee in 2010, given her fundraising contacts, her eye for\\npolitical talent and her proven ability to raise money for the\\nparty. she has raised several million dollars for obama and helped\\nseveral senate candidates this year.\\n\\nschumer also led the senatorial committee in 2006; he said he\\nwould not think until after tuesday about doing it again. some\\nadvisers to clinton said that the idea was intriguing but that they\\ndid not know how she felt about it. she declined to be interviewed\\nfor this article.\\n\\nin the near term -- the first year of the next presidential\\nadministration -- several associates said she would like to be an\\nally of the white house\\'s next occupant, whoever that is.\\n\\nfor a president obama, her favorite, clinton advisers say she\\nmight be positioned to be a point person on his proposal for\\nexpanding access to health insurance or for his energy plan, two\\nissues that she and obama promoted during the primaries.\\n\\nher hand in health care depends largely, her advisers say, on\\nsen. edward m. kennedy, given his experience with health care\\nissues and his seniority. kennedy has been in the senate for 46\\nyears, clinton for 8, and she does not hold a committee\\nchairmanship, where real power resides. kennedy has been battling\\ncancer, and many washington democrats believe that he will be too\\nill to carry a major legislative program. but clinton, like other\\ndemocrats, would defer to him.\\n\\nfor a president mccain, on the other hand, clinton might be an\\nemissary between his white house and a democratic-led congress.\\n\\n\"she has done more for obama than dean did in 2004 for kerry,\\nmore than bradley did for gore in 2000, more than kennedy did for\\ncarter in 1980,\" said james a. thurber, the director of the center\\nfor congressional and presidential studies at american university\\nin washington, d.c. \"as much as this must hurt her, she has been\\nthe ultimate trooper this fall.\"\\n\\nafter years of unfettered growth in military\\nbudgets, defense department planners, top commanders and weapons\\nmanufacturers now say they are almost certain that the financial\\nmeltdown will have a serious impact on future pentagon spending.\\n\\nacross the military services, deep apprehension has led to\\nclosed-door meetings and detailed calculations in anticipation of\\npotential cuts. civilian and military budget planners say that they\\nare already analyzing worst-case contingency spending plans that\\nwould see their overall budgets frozen or slashed.\\n\\nthe obvious targets for savings would be expensive new arms\\nprograms, which have racked up cost overruns of at least $300\\nbillion for the top 75 weapons systems, according to the government\\naccountability office. congressional budget experts say likely\\ntargets for reductions are the army\\'s plans for fielding advanced\\ncombat systems, the air force\\'s joint strike fighter, the navy\\'s\\nnew destroyer and the ground-based missile defense system.\\n\\neven before the crisis on wall street, senior pentagon officials\\nwere anticipating little appetite for growth in military spending\\nafter seven years of war. but the question of how to pay for\\nnational security now looms as a significant challenge for the next\\npresident, at a time when the pentagon\\'s annual base budget for\\nstandard operations has reached more than $500 billion, the highest\\nlevel since world war ii when adjusted for inflation.\\n\\non top of that figure, supplemental spending for the wars in\\niraq and afghanistan has topped $100 billion each year, frustrating\\nrepublicans as well as democrats in congress. in all, the defense\\ndepartment now accounts for half of the government\\'s total\\ndiscretionary spending, and pentagon and military officials fear it\\ncould be the choice for major cuts to pay the rest of the\\ngovernment\\'s bills.\\n\\non the presidential campaign trail, sens. john mccain and barack\\nobama have pledged to cut fat without carving into the muscle of\\nnational security. both have said they would protect the overall\\nlevel of military spending, and mccain has further pledged to add\\nmore troops to the roster of the armed services beyond the 92,000\\nnow advocated by the pentagon, an increase endorsed by obama.\\n\\nsome critics, citing the increase in military spending since\\nsept. 11, 2001, say it would be much easier to cut military\\nspending than programs like social security and medicare at a time\\nwhen most people\\'s retirement savings are dwindling because of the\\nfinancial crisis. rep. barney frank, d-mass., the chairman of the\\nhouse financial services committee, has raised the idea of reducing\\nmilitary spending by 25 percent. at the pentagon, senior officials\\nhave taken up the mission of urging sustained military spending.\\nadm. mike mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has asked\\ncongress and the nation to pledge at least 4 percent of the gross\\ndomestic product to the military. and defense secretary robert m.\\ngates has warned against repeating historic trends, in which the\\nnation cut money for the armed services after a period of warfare.\\n\\n\"we basically gutted our military after world war i, after\\nworld war ii, in certain ways after korea, certainly after vietnam\\nand after the end of the cold war,\" gates said. \"experience is\\nthe ability to recognize a mistake when you make it again.\"\\n\\ngates acknowledges that military spending is almost certain to\\nlevel off, and he expressed a goal that the pentagon budget at\\nleast keep pace with inflation over coming years.\\n\\napprehension over potential budget cuts has trickled down the\\npentagon bureaucracy to those who draft the military\\'s annual\\nspending proposals.\\n\\n\"if that\\'s what they want, they have to know that we simply\\ncannot do everything we are doing now, but for less money,\" said\\none pentagon budget officer who was not authorized to speak for\\nattribution. \"so if there\\'s going to be less, it\\'s up to the\\npresident, congress and the public to tell us what part of our\\nnational security mission we should stop carrying out.\"\\n\\nmuch of the pentagon budget pays for personnel costs, which are\\ndifficult to cut at any time, particularly while troops are risking\\ntheir lives in combat.\\n\\nobama has said his plan to begin drawing down american forces\\nfrom iraq would ease a wartime taxpayer burden that now totals more\\nthan $10 billion a month. but budget analysts at the pentagon and\\non capitol hill say that even troop reductions in iraq -- whether at\\nthe cautious pace laid out by president bush and endorsed by mccain\\nor at the more rapid pace prescribed by obama -- would present only\\nsmall savings in the first years.\\n\\nmoving tens of thousands of troops and their heavy equipment\\nhome from the persian gulf region is a costly undertaking. and\\nhousing at stateside bases is more expensive than in the war zone,\\nso savings would be seen only in subsequent years.\\n\\ncalls by both presidential candidates to shift troops from iraq\\nto afghanistan would add costs to the pentagon budget, according to\\nmilitary planners and congressional budget experts. it is\\nsignificantly more expensive to sustain each soldier in afghanistan\\nthan in iraq because of afghanistan\\'s landlocked location and\\nprimitive road network.\\n\\nthe federal budget is due to congress in february, but that\\ndocument is expected to be little more than an outline, arriving\\nsoon after inauguration day. congressional officials predict the\\nnew president will require several months to put his imprint on a\\ndetailed spending plan.\\n\\non the campaign trail, obama has said he would initially\\nmaintain overall military spending at current levels.\\n\\n\"obama has made it very clear that he doesn\\'t see how the\\ndefense budget can be cut now given the commitments we have,\" said\\nf. whitten peters, a former air force secretary now advising obama\\non national security policies. \"his sense is that there is not\\nmoney to be cut from the defense budget in the near term.\"\\n\\nbut in looking to future pentagon budgets, it is clear that\\n\"all the weapons programs cannot fit,\" he added.\\n\\n\"so,\" he continued, \"you\\'re going to have to make some hard\\ndecisions.\"\\n\\nmccain, a former navy combat pilot who was taken prisoner during\\nthe war in vietnam, is known for taking on what he has seen as\\nwasteful pentagon spending.\\n\\naccording to one of his advisers on military policy, mccain\\n\"feels very strongly that the whole procurement process is totally\\ndysfunctional.\"\\n\\n\"he believes that putting order, discipline and accountability\\nback into the process will stop the gold-plating and bring costs\\ndown,\" said the adviser, who asked not to be named in order to\\ndiscuss the candidate\\'s views frankly.\\n\\nthese budget pressures also seem quite likely to add to the\\ntensions between congress and the pentagon over the best balance\\nbetween supporting the troops fighting insurgencies and\\ndevelopingweapons that might be needed in larger wars.\\n\\n\"i think we need a complete review of this whole thing,\" said\\nrep. neil abercrombie, d-hawaii, the chairman of a house armed\\nservices subcommittee. \"you cannot make a case for undermining the\\nreadiness of the army and the marines in the circumstances that we\\nface today with a commitment of so much money to weapons systems\\nthat are at best abstract and theoretical.\"\\n\\nexecutives at the leading defense contractors say they realize\\nthat the pentagon\\'s spending is likely to be more restrained.\\nboeing\\'s chief executive, w. james mcnerney jr., recently wrote in\\na note to his employees: \"no one really yet knows when or to what\\nextent defense spending could be affected. but it\\'s unrealistic to\\nthink there won\\'t be some measure of impact.\"\\n\\nronald d. sugar, the chief executive of northrop grumman, told\\nstock analysts last month that financing for the company\\'s projects\\nseemed locked in for the coming year. but, sugar added, \"clearly\\nthe pressures are going to increase in the out years.\" a number of\\nscholars who have examined the subject, including david c.\\nhendrickson, a political scientist at colorado college, predict\\nthat \"defense will not prove to be \\'recession-proof.\"\\'\\n\\n\"serious savings could be had by reducing force structure and\\nlimiting modernization,\" said hendrickson, who posted a\\n\"blogbook\" on the financial crisis at\\npictorial-guide-to-crisis.blogspot.com. \"though american power has\\nweakened on every count, there is no reconsideration of objectives.\\ndefining a coherent philosophy in foreign affairs and defense\\nstrategy that is respectful of limits is vital.\"\\n\\nother analysts, like loren b. thompson of the lexington\\ninstitute, a policy research center, say that weapons spending will\\nbe fiercely defended by many in congress and their allies in the\\nweapons industry as a way to stimulate the economy. buying new\\narmaments and repairing worn-out weapons, thompson said, protects\\njobs and corporate profits, and therefore benefits the economy\\noverall.\\n\\ndukakis delivers the laughs in \\'worst\\'\\n\\n      by mekeisha madden toby\\n\\n      detroit news television writer\\n\\n      mekeisha madden toby\\n\\n

political settlement with the rebels. the trick is that\\neastern congo has always been a headache to rule. and the rebels\\nbased in the thickly forested hills around here seem stronger than\\never.\\n\\nthey are led by a charismatic troublemaker, laurent nkunda, who\\ncommands a well-trained, well-equipped guerrilla army from an\\nabandoned belgian farmhouse in the jungle. he is an ethnic tutsi,\\nand congolese officials have painted nkunda, a renegade general, as\\na pawn of tutsi-led rwanda next door.\\n\\nthough it is unclear how actively rwanda might be supporting\\nnkunda, rwandan meddling here would be far from unprecedented.\\ncongo has suffered a long history of exploitation, going back to\\nthe belgian colonial times. various rebel groups and foreign forces\\nhave annexed large swaths of the country to extract gold, diamonds,\\ntin and timber.\\n\\nat times, too, the congolese government has invited its\\nneighbors in, trying to find defenders at critical moments.\\n\\njust a few days ago, for example, the government urged its old\\nfriend angola to send troops back into congo, as angola did in\\n1998, to counter nkunda\\'s rebellion and a perceived rwandan menace.\\nvillagers near goma said last week that they had seen uniformed\\nrwandan soldiers fighting alongside nkunda\\'s men and that the\\nrwandans had burned homes and killed children.\\n\\n\"i saw them come over the border with my own eyes,\" said\\njackson busisi, a farmer.\\n\\nrwanda denies all this.\\n\\ncongo analysts say that nkunda may have some legitimate\\npolitical goals -- and congolese ones at that. for starters, he\\nseems determined to eliminate the hutu death squads who\\nparticipated in the massacre of 800,000 people in rwanda in 1994\\nand then fled into congo, where they continue to brutalize, with\\nimpunity. the congolese government has promised to disarm the\\nsquads. but the rebels -- and many western diplomats -- say the\\ngovernment is actually giving the hutu death squads guns.\\n\\n\"the congolese army is working hand in hand with these\\nkillers,\" said babu amani, a spokesman for the rebels.\\n\\nthe rebels want to play a bigger role in governing eastern congo\\nand even possibly to carve the territory into ethnic fiefs. nkunda\\nhas recently been reaching out to hutus, and it seems that he is\\ntrying to refashion himself into a leader for all rwandan-speaking\\npeople in the eastern congo province of north kivu, where rwandan\\nspeakers make up about 40 percent of the population and dominate\\nmany of the important businesses.\\n\\nbut nkunda\\'s ambitions may go beyond even that. across the\\ncountry, congolese are getting fed up with their president, joseph\\nkabila, who has little to show after winning a historic election in\\n2006, congo\\'s first nationwide democratic vote since independence\\nin 1960. the top opposition leader, jean-pierre bemba, a former\\nvice president, has been in jail in the hague in recent months,\\nfacing international war crimes charges in connection with\\nbloodshed and mass rapes in the central african republic five years\\nago. this may be an irresistible opportunity for nkunda\\'s rebel\\ntroops, the national congress for the defense of the people, or\\ncndp, to forge opportunistic alliances with other dissident groups\\nand possibly try to push kabila out.\\n\\n\"cndp has the brains, the money, the muscle and the\\ndetermination to achieve it,\" said a western analyst who works on\\ncongo issues and said he would speak only on condition of anonymity\\nbecause of the sensitivity of his job. \"the other side has none of\\nthe above.\"\\n\\nthis may explain why nkunda paused last week right at the\\ndoorstep of goma, without walking in. he showed that he was\\npowerful and that the government was weak. he avoided dealing with\\nthe mess of occupying a major city, especially when the united\\nnations had urged him to stay out. in the end, he obtained the\\nleverage he needed for future negotiations, without sustained\\nfighting or damage to his reputation.\\n\\na meeting has now been called between rwanda and congo. aid\\norganizations are urging the united states to put more pressure on\\nrwanda, its ally, to rein in nkunda. diplomats are shuttling\\nbetween congo and rwanda, trying to get the two sides to focus on\\npeace treaties they have already signed, so another regional war\\ndoes not break out.\\n\\n\"there will be a summit,\" vlassenroot said. \"and there will\\nbe a nice document coming out of it. but it won\\'t change\\nanything.\"\\n\\nwhat congo needs, he said, is a true change of culture that\\nwould end the long tradition of corruption and criminally inept\\ngovernment and the attendant rebellions.\\n\\ngiven the decades of unending crisis here, no one sees that\\nhappening anytime soon.\\n\\nduring its long history, an eight-bedroom

also\\nwhere actress judy garland spent her pre-hollywood childhood, and a\\nlocal author is hoping that small piece of hollywood history can\\nbring a bit of fame -- and tourist dollars -- to lancaster.\\n\\ngarland, then known as frances ethel gumm, moved with her family\\nto lancaster in 1927 when she was about 5 and left in 1933. two\\nyears later, she signed her first contract with mgm and by 1939\\nachieved worldwide fame in \"the wizard of oz.\"\\n\\nfor the past year, local author and journalist bonnie domrose\\nstone has been talking to community groups to drum up interest in\\nacquiring the house for a garland museum -- drawing tourists in with\\na yellow brick road leading from lancaster boulevard to the home\\'s\\nfront yard.\\n\\n\"how valuable it is to have a house on the original property on\\nthe street where she walked,\" stone said.\\n\\nstone is still in the early stages of planning and has not\\nobtained funding or a cost estimate yet.\\n\\nshe noted that the nonprofit judy garland museum in grand\\nrapids, minn. -- where the actress was born on june 10, 1922 --\\nattracts 20,000 visitors a year.\\n\\nstone said the museum could tie in with the city\\'s signature\\nevent, the lancaster poppy festival, and the fact that many films\\nhave been shot in the antelope valley.\\n\\n\"we\\'ve got the state\\'s only poppy reserve and festival. those\\ntwo things would tie in beautifully with having judy garland\\'s\\nhouse as a museum and visitor center,\" stone said.\\n\\n\"the potential to bring in tourism is there. it just has to be\\ntapped.\"\\n\\ngarland -- who died of an accidental overdose of barbiturates on\\njune 22, 1969 -- actually lived in three different homes in\\nlancaster, and performed with her two older sisters. mary jane and\\ndorothy, at a movie theater on sierra highway operated by her\\nfather. but stone believes the house at 44665 cedar ave. is the\\nbest choice for a museum because it is now in bank foreclosure, and\\nthe other two homes are still privately owned.\\n\\nat the same time, another group of local residents is looking at\\nrestoring a theater at a school that garland attended and turning\\nit into a performing arts venue bearing her name.\\n\\ngarland attended cedar avenue school and performed in the\\nschool\\'s theater, whose double-door, concrete-arched entrance\\nresembles that of a church.\\n\\nthe school was built in the 1920s and was the first elementary\\nschool in the lancaster school district. all that remains of the\\ncampus is the theater and a classroom wing.\\n\\nretired district superintendent steve gocke has promoted the\\nidea since 2002.\\n\\nboth the district\\'s board and fundraising foundation have gotten\\nbehind the plan. when gocke retired at the end of 2006, a few\\nthousand dollars in donations were made to support the project,\\nfoundation officials said.\\n\\n\"we\\'re in the process of getting enough people interested in it\\nto get force behind it,\" said gocke, who wants to get the\\nsurviving family\\'s blessing to use garland\\'s name.\\n\\ngarland\\'s lancaster roots also recently attracted the attention\\nof a

incumbents in suburban and even\\nmore outlying areas -- the traditional foundation of republican\\npower in the house. with many of the most contested house races\\noccurring in republican-held districts that extend beyond cities in\\nstates like florida, michigan, minnesota and ohio, democrats said\\nexpected victories would give them suburban dominance.\\n\\nthe same is true for senate democratic candidates, who are\\nseeking to nail down swing counties outside urban centers and move\\nthe party toward a 60-vote majority. that majority could overcome a\\nfilibuster, if party leaders could hold the votes together.\\n\\namong open house seats democrats say they have a good chance of\\ncapturing include those being vacated by rep. john r. kuhl jr. in\\nnew york, ralph regula and deborah pryce in ohio, jim ramstad in\\nminnesota, jerry weller in illinois and rick renzi in arizona.\\n\\nincumbents democrats believe they can defeat include rep. joe\\nknollenberg in michigan, tom feeney and ric keller in florida, don\\nyoung in alaska, robin hayes in north carolina and bill sali in\\nidaho.\\n\\ndemocrats say they have been able to peel away suburbanites by\\nemphasizing republican culpability for the economic decline, a\\npoint they say house republicans helped make themselves by\\ninitially balking at the $700 billion bailout and sending the\\nmarkets into a tailspin that depleted retirement and college\\nsavings accounts.\\n\\n\"suburban voters are angry that their quality of life and\\nstandard of living is under attack,\" said rep. rahm emanuel of\\nillinois, chairman of the house democratic caucus and a leading\\nadvocate of democrats trying to broaden their appeal in the\\nsuburbs.\\n\\nthe partisan spending gap was stark. as of last week, senate\\ndemocrats had spent more than $67 million against republican\\ncandidates, compared with $33.7 million in advertising by\\nrepublicans. in the house, the democratic congressional campaign\\ncommittee had spent $73 million, compared with just over $20\\nmillion for the national republican congressional committee,\\naccording to campaign finance reports.\\n\\nmost of the house republican money was spent on behalf of\\nincumbents or in districts where a republican is retiring,\\nemphasizing how much the party was playing defense. by contrast,\\nhouse democrats spent most of their money in the last month going\\nafter republican seats in colorado, nebraska, washington, west\\nvirginia and elsewhere. on sunday, democrats prepared one last\\nradio advertisement to begin running monday in an effort to claim\\nthe seat of thomas m. reynolds, a republican retiring from his\\nupstate new york district near buffalo.\\n\\n\"that kind of says it all,\" said rep. thomas m. davis iii, a\\nretiring virginia republican whose own suburban seat is likely to\\ngo democratic on tuesday. davis said republicans simply faced too\\nmany disadvantages heading into election day, including a lopsided\\nnumber of retirements in the house and senate, an unpopular\\npresident and an economic collapse.\\n\\n\"you like to see a fair fight,\" said davis, a former chairman\\nof the republican congressional campaign committee, \"but basically\\nwe are playing basketball in our street shoes and long pants, and\\nthe democrats have on their uniforms and chuck taylors.\"\\n\\nneither of the national senate campaign arms was advertising in\\ncolorado, new mexico or virginia, indicating that republicans were\\nvirtually ceding those states, where members of their party are\\nretiring, to the democrats. senate democrats were also optimistic\\nabout the prospects of unseating sen. john e. sununu in new\\nhampshire and sen. ted stevens in alaska, where stevens campaigned\\ndespite being newly convicted on felony ethics charges.\\n\\ndemocrats said they saw themselves with the advantage in\\nminnesota, north carolina and oregon, giving them a reasonable\\nchance at claiming eight seats and enlarging their senate majority\\nto 59 if they hold their current seats.\\n\\nif democrats swept those races, it could leave the potential\\n60th vote to break filibusters resting on the outcome in georgia,\\nmississippi or kentucky, where sen. mitch mcconnell, the republican\\nleader, is in a competitive race with bruce lunsford, a\\nbusinessman. polls show democrats trailing but within striking\\ndistance in all three races, with the final results potentially\\nhinging on the presidential race and turnout among democratically\\ninclined black voters.\\n\\nin mississippi, which has not sent a freshman democrat to the\\nsenate since john c. stennis was elected in 1947, sen. roger\\nwicker, a republican appointed last year to fill the seat left\\nvacant by trent lott\\'s resignation, is in a tight race with former\\ngov. ronnie musgrove, a democrat.\\n\\n\"we feel we have a lot of momentum,\" said sen. charles e.\\nschumer of new york, chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign\\ncommittee, \"but we are ever mindful that getting to 60 is an\\nextremely difficult thing to do because we are in so many red\\nstates.\"\\n\\nrepublicans privately acknowledged that there was little hope\\nfor some of their candidates, including sen. elizabeth dole of\\nnorth carolina. but republicans have not given up on the idea of\\nunseating sen. mary l. landrieu in louisiana, a state where sen.\\njohn mccain was running well against sen. barack obama in the\\npresidential race. a victory over landrieu by john kennedy, the\\nstate treasurer, would be a significant moral victory for\\nrepublicans, and they pointed to internal polls that show a close\\nrace.\\n\\nin louisiana, north carolina and oregon, republicans were trying\\nto energize voters with the threat of democratic dominance in\\nwashington, running advertisements that warn voters about\\n\"complete liberal control of government.\"\\n\\n\"we agree with chuck schumer that this is a tectonic\\nelection,\" said rebecca fisher, spokeswoman for the national\\nrepublican senatorial committee. \"and if democrats get their way,\\nthis country will shift so far left it will take generations to get\\nback on track.\"\\n\\nboth parties were focusing substantial final energies on the\\nsenate race in minnesota, where sen. norm coleman, the republican,\\nwas in a heated clash with his democratic challenger, al franken, a\\nformer comedian and radio talk show host. the race remained close\\nas coleman was named in a last-minute lawsuit in texas alleging\\nthat a businessman had funneled $75,000 to him through his wife\\'s\\nbusiness. coleman, who has filed an unfair campaign practices\\ncomplaint accusing franken of broadcasting falsehoods in his\\nadvertisements, denied any impropriety, but the lawsuit led to a\\nflurry of news accounts only days before the election.\\n\\nin kentucky, mcconnell enlisted hundreds of volunteers to knock\\non doors and to make phone calls in the remaining hours. he was to\\nembark on a fly-around of the state\\'s cities monday in his effort\\nto repel the serious challenge from lunsford, who brought in one of\\nkentucky\\'s favorite daughters, the actress ashley judd, to campaign\\non his behalf in the closing days.\\n\\nstrategists for both parties said it seemed increasingly\\npossible that the full senate picture might not even be settled\\ntuesday, given that a third-party candidate could cause both sen.\\nsaxby chambliss, r-ga., and his democratic opponent, jim martin, to\\nfall short of 50 percent of the vote, forcing a runoff on dec. 2.\\n\\nparty operatives also warned that tuesday was likely to produce\\nsome surprises, considering the strong resentment toward congress\\nthat has been reflected in polls for months. they predicted upsets\\nof some house incumbents not thought to be in trouble.\\n\\nrepublicans said they believed some top targets of the\\ndemocrats, like rep. dave reichert of washington and christopher\\nshays of connecticut, would be able to hang on because they, and\\nothers, had run strong campaigns built on their individual images\\nand records.\\n\\n\"republican candidates who have established their own personal\\nbrand, and have framed their respective races around creating a\\nclear choice, will succeed on election day despite the turbulent\\npolitical environment,\" said ken spain, a spokesman for the\\nnational republican congressional committee.\\n\\none problem for house republicans was that freshmen lawmakers\\nwho gave democrats control of the house after the 2006 elections\\nwere faring much better than party leaders had expected. some, like\\nrep. kirsten gillibrand, who represents the hudson valley in new\\nyork, became prime republican targets virtually from the moment\\nthey were elected but are favored to win second terms after raising\\nformidable sums of money and cultivating moderate voting records\\nthat insulated them from attack.\\n\\nrep. john yarmuth of kentucky, president of the democrats\\' 2006\\nfreshman class, said only two of its members were in serious\\ntrouble: rep. nick lampson of texas, who represents a heavily\\nrepublican district south of houston, and rep. tim mahoney of\\nflorida, who has been entangled in a scandal over extramarital\\naffairs.\\n\\nyarmuth credited house democratic leaders with pursuing an\\nagenda that gave the freshmen substantial achievements to promote\\nback home, especially a generous new education benefit for veterans\\nthat counterbalanced the democrats\\' opposition to the war in iraq.\\n\\n\"i think that was a trademark of this last congress that\\ncreated a moderate image that we were pro-military, pro-troops,\"\\nyarmuth said.\\n\\nmilitary and civilian deaths in iraq for october hit\\nthe lowest monthly levels since may 2004, the u.s. military said\\nsunday.\\n\\nthe announcement was further evidence of a decline in violence\\nsince a significant troop increase last year, but the tragedy of\\none family in kirkuk is a reminder of just how dangerous life in\\niraq continues to be.\\n\\nin the past year, khudaer muhammad abdullah, 49, endured the\\nloss of his two older sons. on sunday he lost his last son, and his\\n4-year-old daughter is now hospitalized with serious wounds. his\\nlast son, muhammad khudaer muhammad, 7, was killed when part of a\\nrocket-propelled grenade exploded on a vacant lot where he was\\nplaying soccer with three other children, according to police\\nreports.\\n\\n\"where should we go now?\" abdullah asked. \"death faces us\\neverywhere.\"\\n\\nthat may be a predicament familiar to families across iraq, but\\nthe u.s. military was still eager to publicize the decline in\\ndeaths.\\n\\n\"thanks to the strategic partnership we have with the coalition\\nforces, the iraqi security forces and the people of iraq, the\\noverall situation here with regard to security continues to\\nimprove,\" brig. gen. david g. perkins, a spokesman for the united\\nstates-led forces in iraq, said at a news conference.\\n\\ndespite those improvements, violence continued to rage in the\\nnorthern city of mosul, where at least 15 iraqis were killed and 32\\nwere wounded last week.\\n\\non sunday, two iraqi soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb\\nexploded in the path of their convoy in the eastern neighborhood of\\nkarama in mosul, said a security official who spoke on the\\ncondition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to\\nthe news media.\\n\\nin the qandeel mountains in northern iraq, officials of the\\nkurdistan workers\\' party said that 20 of their fighters had been\\nkilled in attacks by turkish warplanes, but they said that the\\nmorale of their fighting force remained strong.\\n\\nthey were called the \"dirty 30\" -- bodyguards for osama bin\\nladen captured early in the afghanistan war -- and many of them are\\nstill being held at guantanamo bay, cuba.\\n\\nothers still at the much-criticized detention camp include\\nprisoners who the government says were trained in assassination and\\nthe use of poisons and disguises.\\n\\none detainee is said to have been schooled in making detonators\\nout of sega game cartridges. a yemeni who has received little\\npublic attention was originally selected by bin laden as a\\npotential sept. 11 hijacker, intelligence officials say.\\n\\nas the bush administration enters its final months with no\\napparent plan to close guantanamo, an extensive review of the\\ngovernment\\'s military tribunal files suggests that dozens of the\\napproximately 255 prisoners remaining in detention are said by\\nmilitary and intelligence agencies to have been captured with\\nimportant terrorism suspects, to have connections to top qaida\\nleaders or to have other serious terrorism credentials.\\n\\nsens. john mccain and barack obama have said they would close\\nthe detention camp, but the review of the government\\'s public files\\nunderscores the challenges of fulfilling that promise. the next\\npresident will have to contend with sobering intelligence claims\\nagainst many of the remaining detainees.\\n\\n\"it would be very difficult for a new president to come in and\\nsay, \\'i don\\'t believe what the cia is saying about these guys,\"\\'\\nsaid daniel marcus, a democrat who was general counsel of the 9/11\\ncommission and held senior positions in the carter and clinton\\nadministrations.\\n\\nthe strength of the evidence is difficult to assess, because the\\ngovernment has kept much of it secret and because of questions\\nabout whether some was gathered through torture.\\n\\nwhen the administration has had to defend its allegations in\\ncourt, government lawyers in several cases have retreated from the\\nmost serious claims. as a result, critics have raised doubts about\\nthe danger of guantanamo\\'s prisoners beyond a handful of the camp\\'s\\nmost notorious detainees.\\n\\nbut as a new administration begins to sort through the\\ngovernment\\'s dossiers on the men, the analysis shows, officials are\\nlikely to face tough choices in deciding how many of guantanamo\\'s\\ndetainees should be sent home, how many should be charged and what\\nto do with the rest.\\n\\nthe pentagon has declined to provide a list of the detainees or\\neven to specify how many there are beyond offering a figure of\\n\"about 255.\" but by reviewing thousands of pages of government\\ndocuments released in recent years, as well as court records and\\nnews media reports from around the world, the new york times was\\nable to compile its own list and construct a picture of the\\npopulation still detained at guantanamo. much of the analysis is\\nbased on records of hearings at guantanamo about individual\\ndetainees, which have been made public since 2006 as a result of a\\nlawsuit by the associated press.\\n\\nthe times has posted those documents on its web site arranged by\\ndetainee name.\\n\\nthe analysis shows that about 34 of the remaining detainees were\\nseized in raids in pakistan that netted three men the government\\ncalls major qaida operatives: abu zubaydah, ramzi binalhibh and al\\nhajj abdu ali sharqawi. sixteen detainees are accused of some of\\nthe most significant terrorist attacks in the last decade,\\nincluding the 1998 u.s. embassy bombings, the 2000 attack on the\\nuss cole in yemen, and the sept. 11 attacks. twenty others were\\ncalled bin laden\\'s bodyguards.\\n\\nthe analysis also shows that 13 of the original 23 detainees who\\narrived at guantanamo on jan. 11, 2002, remain there nearly seven\\nyears later.\\n\\nof the approximately 255 men now being held, more than 60 have\\nbeen cleared for release or transfer, according to the pentagon,\\nbut remain at guantanamo because of difficulties negotiating\\ntransfer agreements between the united states and other countries.\\n\\ntwo of those still held, government documents show, were seen by\\nbin laden as potential sept. 11 hijackers. the case of mohammed\\nal-qahtani, whom the government has labeled a potential \"20th\\nhijacker,\" has drawn wide notice because he was subjected to\\ninterrogation tactics that included sleep deprivation, isolation\\nand being put on a leash and forced to perform dog tricks.\\n\\nthe other detainee deemed a potential hijacker, whose presence\\nat guantanamo has gone virtually unmentioned in public reports, is\\na yemeni called abu bara. the 9/11 commission said he studied\\nflights and airport security and participated in an important\\nplanning meeting for the 2001 attack in malaysia in january 2000.\\n\\nthe guantanamo list also includes two saudi brothers, hassan bin\\nattash and walid mohammed bin attash. the government describes them\\nas something like qaida royalty. military officials said during\\nguantanamo hearings that their father, imprisoned in saudi arabia,\\nwas a \"close contact of osama bin laden\" and that his sons were\\ncommitted jihadists.\\n\\nwalid mohammed bin attash is facing a possible death sentence as\\na coordinator of the sept. 11 attacks. hassan bin attash was\\nalleged to have been involved in planning attacks on american oil\\ntankers and navy ships.\\n\\nhassan bin attash\\'s lawyer, david h. remes, said the\\ngovernment\\'s claims about the detainees were not credible. he and\\nother detainees\\' lawyers say that the government\\'s accusations have\\nbeen ever-changing and that much of the evidence was obtained using\\ntechniques he and others have described as torture.\\n\\n\"you look at all of this stuff, and it looks terribly scary,\"\\nremes said. \"but how do we know any of it is true?\"\\n\\nthe extensive use of secret evidence and information derived\\nfrom aggressive interrogations has led many critics in the united\\nstates and around the world to conclude that many detainees were\\nwrongly held. nearly seven years after guantanamo opened its metal\\ngates, only 18 of the current detainees are currently facing war\\ncrimes charges.\\n\\nwhile both presidential candidates said they would close the\\ndetention center, they have not said in detail how they would\\nhandle the remaining detainees.\\n\\nmccain has said he would move the guantanamo detainees to the\\nunited states, but has indicated that he would try them in the\\npentagon\\'s commission system established after 9/11. after the\\nconviction at guantanamo last summer of a former driver for osama\\nbin laden, mccain said the verdict \"demonstrated that military\\ncommissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to\\njustice.\"\\n\\nobama has said the bush administration\\'s \"system of trying\\ndetainees has been an enormous failure\" and that the existing\\namerican legal system -- either trials in civilian or military\\ncourts -- was strong enough to handle the trials of terror suspects.\\n\\nbut in a speech on the senator floor in 2006, obama suggested\\nthat the allegations against many of the detainees needed to be\\ntaken seriously. \"now the majority of the folks in guantanamo, i\\nsuspect, are there for a reason,\" obama said. \"there are a lot of\\ndangerous people.\"\\n\\nsome of the remaining prisoners, have appeared determined to\\nshow how dangerous they are. \"i admit to you it is my honor to be\\nan enemy of the united states,\" said a yemeni detainee, abdul\\nrahman ahmed, a hearing record shows. officials said ahmed had been\\ntrained at a terrorist camp \"how to dress and act at an airport\"\\nand to resist interrogation.\\n\\na saudi detainee, muhammed murdi issa al zahrani, was described\\nby pentagon officials as a trained assassin who helped plan the\\nsuicide-bomb killing of ahmed shah massoud, the afghan rebel\\nleader, on sept. 9, 2001.\\n\\n\"the detainee said america is ruled by the jews,\" an officer\\nsaid at a hearing after interviewing zahrani, \"therefore america\\nand israel are his enemies.\"\\n\\none man caught with abu zubaydah insisted on his innocence, but\\ndescribed a training camp outside kabul, afghanistan, where,\\naccording to information he gave interrogators, men were given\\nlessons on how to make poisons that could be inhaled, swallowed or\\nabsorbed through the skin.\\n\\nbinalshibh was caught with a group of six yemenis, all of whom\\nare still held, after a two-and-a-half hour gunbattle. the records\\nof those detainees include allegations that some were \"a special\\nterrorist team deployed to attack targets in karachi.\" one of the\\nmen, hail aziz ahmad al maythal, was trained in the use of\\nrocket-propelled grenade launchers, machine guns and \"trench\\ndigging, disguise techniques, escape methods, evasion and map\\nreading,\" according to the military\\'s allegations.\\n\\nthe records include many of the murky cases that typify the\\nimage of guantanamo, where detainees take issue with their own\\nsupposed confessions and, sometimes, their identities. and those\\ndoubts, too, are to be part of a new administration\\'s inheritance.\\n\\n\"i was forced to say all these things,\" an algerian detainee,\\nadil hadi al jazairi bin hamlili, said at his hearing when\\nconfronted with his confession to murder and knowledge of a plot to\\nsell uranium to al-qaida. \"i was abused mentally and\\npsychologically, by threatening to be raped,\" he said, adding,\\n\"you would say anything.\"\\n\\nabdul hafiz, an afghan accused of killing a red cross worker at\\na taliban roadblock in 2003, told a military officer that he had\\nthe perfect alibi. the detainee states again that he is not abdul\\nhafiz, the officer reported to a military tribunal.\\n\\nthe government of zimbabwe, led by\\npresident robert mugabe, spent $7.3 million donated by an\\ninternational organization to fight killer diseases on other things\\nand has failed to honor requests to return the money, according to\\nthe organization\\'s inspector general.\\n\\nthe actions by zimbabwe have deprived the organization, the\\nglobal fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria, of resources\\nit needs and damaged efforts to expand lifesaving treatment, said\\nthe inspector general, john parsons. zimbabwe\\'s actions also\\njeopardize a more ambitious $188 million global fund grant to\\nzimbabwe, due for consideration by the fund\\'s board on friday,\\nparsons said.\\n\\nthe global fund has continued to demand that zimbabwe return the\\nmoney, and global fund officials say zimbabwean financial officials\\nhave promised to do so by thursday. but parsons said zimbabwean\\nofficials also said they had not repaid the money because they did\\nnot have enough foreign currency.\\n\\nthe breakdown of trust between the global fund and the\\ngovernment of zimbabwe comes at a moment of widening humanitarian\\ncrisis and casts further doubt on the willingness of western donors\\nto invest heavily in rebuilding the economically broken nation as\\nlong as mugabe is in charge, even if a deadlock over a\\npower-sharing government is resolved.\\n\\nparsons said in an interview on sunday that last year the global\\nfund deposited $12.3 million in foreign currency into zimbabwe\\'s\\nreserve bank. he declined to speculate on how the $7.3 million it\\nwas seeking to be returned had been spent, except to say it was not\\non the intended purpose. civic groups and opposition officials\\nmaintain that the reserve bank helps finance mugabe\\'s patronage\\nmachine.\\n\\nparsons did offer an example of the human consequences of the\\nreserve bank\\'s failure to hand over the money for disease fighting.\\nthe global fund has brought in large quantities of medicines that\\ncan cure malaria, but has been able to finance the training of only\\n495 people to distribute them safely instead of the planned 27,000.\\nthere were 2.7 million cases of malaria among zimbabwe\\'s 12 million\\npeople in the world health organization\\'s most recent estimates.\\n\\n\"the drugs expire by the middle of next year, and it would be\\ncriminal if we can\\'t use them because of these problems,\" parsons\\nsaid. \"they\\'ve got quite a short shelf life.\"\\n\\nher crowds are smaller now, and most of the\\nreporters are gone. the campaign posters say his name, not hers.\\nand instead of championing her ideas for health insurance or tax\\nrelief, sen. hillary rodham clinton is giving out 1-800 numbers and\\ninternet addresses for sen. barack obama\\'s campaign.\\n\\nwatching clinton campaign for her old rival, masking what\\nfriends say is lingering disappointment, it is easy to recall\\nhappier days.\\n\\nthe bitterness of that long primary battle, however, is the last\\nthing that obama supporters brought up about clinton in florida\\nlast weekend. of 20 interviewed, all effusively praised her. all 20\\nsaid that if obama won, they hoped that she would be his secretary\\nof state or that she would shepherd his health care or energy bills\\nthrough the senate. all 20 said they hoped she would run for\\npresident again.\\n\\nfor the friends and allies already thinking about clinton\\'s\\npolitical future, the possibility of a victory by sen. john mccain\\non tuesday would upend an array of assumptions, not least of which\\nthat clinton -- if she were to run again -- would not do so until\\n2016, when she would be turning 69. at the same time, under a\\nmccain presidency, clinton could be well-positioned, given her\\nfriendship with him and good standing among washington republicans,\\nto help him with a democratic-led congress on alternative energy,\\nwhich they have both highlighted on the campaign trail.\\n\\nwhile clinton\\'s high profile in democratic politics has been\\nfortified by her work for obama, her friends say it is too soon to\\nsay what the future holds for her. for one thing, they say, she is\\nnot over her primary loss: some days it is hard for her, even a\\nlittle heartbreaking, to campaign for obama, given how much she\\nwanted to be president.\\n\\nothers say that she is being a good soldier because she wants to\\nbe a power player in washington if obama wins but that she is not\\nsure what her role might be.\\n\\nmillions of voters will encounter an unfamiliar low-tech\\nlandscape at the polls on tuesday. about half of all voters will\\nvote in a way that is different from what they did in the last\\npresidential election, and most will use paper ballots rather than\\nthe touch-screen machines that have caused concern among voting\\nexperts.\\n\\nbut the change does not guarantee a smooth election day, as the\\nnation\\'s voting system remains untested for what is expected to be\\nan unprecedented turnout. six years after the largest federal\\noverhaul in how elections are run, voting experts are still\\npredicting machine and ballot shortages in several swing states and\\nlate tallies on election night.\\n\\ntwo-thirds of voters will mark their choice with a pencil on a\\npaper ballot that is counted by an optical scanning machine, a\\nmethod considered far more reliable and verifiable than touch\\nscreens. but paper ballots bring their own potential problems,\\nvoting experts say.\\n\\nthe scanners can break down, leading to delays and confusion for\\npoll workers and voters. and the paper ballots of about a third of\\nall voters will be counted not at the polling place but later at a\\ncentral county location. that means that if a voter has made an\\nerror -- not filling in an oval properly, for example, a mistake\\noften made by the kind of novice voters who will be flocking to the\\npolls -- it will not be caught until it is too late. as a result,\\nthose ballots will be disqualified.\\n\\nvoting rights groups have also filed lawsuits against election\\nofficials in pennsylvania and virginia, saying they have not\\nstocked enough paper ballots to prepare for the expected turnout.\\n\\nmost voting experts are not predicting a repeat of the florida\\nmeltdown of 2000, but they are warning that shortages of electronic\\nvoting machines or printed ballots in swing states, along with\\nproblems verifying the identity of voters, could worsen lines and\\nfray nerves.\\n\\n\"what has traditionally happened in this country is that a\\nchange in voting equipment happens once in the lifetime of an\\nelection official,\" said kimball w. brace, president of election\\ndata services, a voting research firm. \"this time, nearly 60\\npercent of the country will vote in places that in the last eight\\nyears have changed their voting equipment.\"\\n\\nabout a fourth of voters will still use electronic machines that\\noffer no paper record to verify that their choice was accurately\\nrecorded, even though these machines are vulnerable to hacking and\\ncrashes that drop votes. the machines will be used by most voters\\nin indiana, kentucky, pennsylvania, tennessee, texas and virginia.\\neight other states, including georgia, maryland, new jersey and\\nsouth carolina, will use touch-screen machines with paper trails.\\n\\nin states with early voting, there have been scattered reports\\nof touch-screen machine malfunctions, ballot misprints causing\\nscanners to jam and vote-flipping, in which the vote cast for one\\ncandidate is recorded for another.\\n\\nflorida has switched to its third ballot system in the past\\nthree election cycles, and glitches associated with the transition\\nhave caused confusion at early voting sites, election officials\\nsaid. the state went back to using scanned paper ballots this year\\nafter touch-screen machines in sarasota county failed to record any\\nchoice for 18,000 voters in a fiercely contested house race in\\n2006.\\n\\nvoters in colorado, tennessee, texas and west virginia have\\nreported using touch-screen machines that at least initially\\nregistered their choice for the wrong candidate or party.\\n\\n\"i pushed the democrat ticket, and it jumped to the republican\\nticket for president of the united states,\" said calvin thomas,\\n81, an obama supporter who tried to vote early in ripley, w.va.\\n\"i\\'m a registered republican, and i\\'ve voted in every presidential\\nelection since 1948. i don\\'t like seeing my vote do something i\\ndidn\\'t tell it to do. i take that real serious.\"\\n\\nthomas\\' daughter, micki clendenin, said the same thing had\\nhappened to her.\\n\\nin both cases, poll workers at the site had them touch the\\nscreen a few more times, and the voting machine changed their\\nballot to their candidate choice. state and local officials said\\nthese were isolated cases and that poll workers had fixed the\\nproblems.\\n\\n\"it was corrected,\" clendenin said, \"but it still made me\\nwonder.\"\\n\\nit was not supposed to be this way.\\n\\nafter the debacle of 2000, congress passed a federal law, the\\nhelp america vote act, to avoid similar mishaps. it included money\\nfor new machines to modernize the voting process. but in many ways,\\nthings have become even messier. the first machines bought with the\\nfederal money were largely touch-screens and brought new problems,\\ndecreasing public confidence in the process and doubling the number\\nof election-related lawsuits since 2000.\\n\\nin the past two years, the pendulum has swung away from\\nelectronic machines, but the change has come during one of the most\\ndramatic presidential elections in modern history.\\n\\n\"counties and states are better prepared for machine problems\\nthan they have been in the past,\" said lawrence norden, a voting\\nexpert with the brennan center for justice at the new york\\nuniversity school of law. \"problem is that this election may not\\nbe like any other in terms of the strain on the system, and small\\nproblems can have big consequences when there are such tight\\nmargins and so many people showing up to vote.\"\\n\\nmost states have passed laws requiring paper records of every\\nvote cast, which experts consider an important safeguard. but most\\nof them do not have strong audit laws to ensure that machine totals\\nare vigilantly checked against the paper records.\\n\\nlast year, a study by the brennan center found that at least 17\\nof the 38 states with paper records did not require audits after\\nevery election. the states with audits do them inadequately, the\\nreport found.\\n\\nin ohio, secretary of state jennifer brunner sued the maker of\\nthe touch-screen equipment used in half of her state\\'s 88 counties\\nafter an investigation showed that the machines \"dropped\" votes\\nin recent elections when memory cards were uploaded to computer\\nservers.\\n\\nas an extra precaution, brunner required all counties to provide\\npaper ballots to anyone who wanted to use them.\\n\\non wednesday, a federal judge ordered election officials in\\npennsylvania to make emergency paper ballots available to voters\\nwhen 50 percent or more of voting machines at a polling location\\nfail. previously, these ballots would be available only if all the\\nmachines at a polling place broke down.\\n\\na report released last

barack\\nobama\\'s ear as he slouched down in a black leather chair in the\\nfront cabin of his campaign airplane. he leaned away from the\\nheadrest, where his name is spelled out in blue stitching.\\n\\na few miles away, thousands of people streamed into jfk stadium\\nat parkview high school for a late-night rally on saturday. but\\nobama stayed on his chartered boeing 757 as he spoke by conference\\ncall to thousands of his team leaders around the country, the\\nvolunteers who form the ranks of an army that he hopes will give\\nhim an edge in the waning hours of the presidential race.\\n\\nas he pressed his right hand to his forehead, his sober\\nexpression seemed at odds with the confident gleam in the eyes of\\nhis advisers. while obama smiles less than he once did, gauging his\\nmood simply by looking at him is risky for a man whose flat-line\\ntemperament has seldom spiked along the rocky points of his\\njourney.\\n\\nin a campaign where he has slogged through more competitive\\nelection days than any recent nominee, only one more lies ahead.\\nand it is the long path of the democratic primary, which lurched\\nfrom the ups of iowa to the downs of ohio, that his friends say\\nprovided obama with a steady equilibrium as he enters this final\\nturn in the race for the white house.\\n\\n\"as painful as the primary season was and how agitating it\\ncould be, it turned out to be a blessing for him,\" said eric\\nwhitaker, a longtime friend from chicago who joined obama aboard\\nthe crowded campaign plane for the last three days. \"but my role\\nnow is to keep him loose. there\\'s a lot going on in his world.\"\\n\\nthe lines in obama\\'s face have grown a bit deeper since he\\nstarted his campaign, with the notches of gray hair along his\\ntemples far more pronounced. he often carries the look of\\nexhaustion, but flying the other night to nevada, where he arrived\\nafter midnight, obama passed on the chance to take much of a nap.\\n\\ninstead, he walked around the cabin of his airplane, which is\\nabout the size of a bedroom, and talked about a favorite diversion\\n-- the coming basketball season -- as he took care not to step on a\\nsenior foreign policy adviser, mark lippert, who was asleep on the\\nfloor.\\n\\nin the last days on the trail, he is finishing \"ghost wars: the\\nsecret history of the cia, afghanistan and bin laden,\" and taking\\nan occasional glance at us weekly. he reads at least two newspapers\\na day, vigilantly checks his blackberry for updates on early-voting\\ntallies and browses briefing books.\\n\\n\"in a marathon, when you are on mile 20 you start getting\\ntired, but when you are on mile 25 you don\\'t,\" said lippert, who\\nhas grown familiar with obama\\'s travel rhythms while accompanying\\nhim on the four foreign trips he has taken since becoming a\\nsenator. \"that\\'s where he\\'s at.\"\\n\\nwhatever emotion he feels as his candidacy draws to a close, he\\ndisplays little of it, either in public appearances or private\\nconversations with his close advisers. the air of confidence that\\nhe exudes, which some critics castigate as arrogance, grew in part\\nout of the primary, when he worked to avoid perceptions that he was\\nweak or not ready.\\n\\nbut now, he is described by friends as feeling as though he has\\nbeen thoroughly tested and is prepared to take on the job he has\\nspent 22 months fighting for. still, it is hard for even those\\nclosest to obama to fathom what these days are precisely like, even\\nfor the imperturbable -- often inscrutable -- senator from illinois.\\n\\nhis world is awash in powerful, conflicting emotions: the\\nrealization, presumably, that he may be about to become president;\\nthe huge optimism that he has unleashed, evident in the crowds he\\nis drawing (and something he has told aides worries him a bit,\\ngiven the expectations set for him); the weighty thinking he is\\ngradually giving to how he would staff a government and deal with a\\ntransition in such a difficult time. all of this is taking place at\\na time where the woman who played a large role in raising him, his\\ngrandmother, is approaching death.\\n\\n\"what if i disappoint people?\" valerie jarrett, a close friend\\nand adviser, recalled obama asking at several points throughout the\\ncampaign. \"that\\'s what gives him the energy to keep getting up\\nevery day.\" it has been months since obama has ventured with any\\nregularity to the back of his plane where the journalists sit. (the\\none time he played the board game taboo on a cross-country flight\\nto oregon is a distant memory.) he has not taken questions for so\\nlong that reporters have taken to shouting at him as he boards his\\nplane. as he climbed up the steps of his airplane here on sunday\\nmorning, headed for ohio, a reporter shouted to question why he\\nhadn\\'t held a news conference in weeks.\\n\\n\"i will,\" obama said. \"on wednesday.\"\\n\\non a final weekend pass through electoral battlegrounds that\\nspanned three time zones, the electoral climate and his campaign\\norganization provide him the luxury of focusing on states that\\nfavored the republican ticket four years ago. but when his\\ndemocratic crowds jeer at the mere mention of sen. john mccain, he\\noffers a gentle scolding: \"you don\\'t need to boo, you just need to\\nvote!\"\\n\\nit is a true crowd-pleaser, and he reprises it in city after\\ncity.\\n\\nhis crowds have rarely been larger or more enthusiastic -- often,\\nperhaps, more outwardly so than the candidate himself. these days,\\nobama is racing through his speeches, whittling down a message that\\nonce stretched for more than an hour to a disciplined 30 minutes.\\nhe works the rope line at every stop, but taking a closer look you\\nrealize that it\\'s as much for a few photographs as for a lot of\\nhandshakes. at each event, though, he stays long enough to sign a\\nstack of books for supporters.\\n\\nduring a rally outside orlando, fla., the other night, where he\\nwas joined for the first time on stage by former president bill\\nclinton, he was visibly chilly in the unusually cool air with a\\ntemperature that dipped into the 40s. he had hoped to wear a coat,\\nbut clinton did not, so obama came to the stage without one. not so\\nthe next night in virginia, where a cool and damp chill also hung\\nin the air.\\n\\n\"i did decide to wear a coat, because you want a president who\\nhas sense,\" obama told the crowd from behind the podium, where he\\nwas covered in a black wool overcoat.\\n\\nwhile he may not be coasting to the finish line, he\\'s not\\nrunning as hard as he did during his battle with sen. hillary\\nrodham clinton for the democratic nomination. on sunday, he was in\\nthe gym of the doubletree hotel here shortly after 6 a.m., but he\\nspent some time with his wife and daughters before boarding his\\nplane at 9:30 a.m. he didn\\'t arrive for his first public event of\\nthe day at the ohio statehouse in columbus until 1 p.m.\\n\\nhis campaign schedule, like obama himself, can be slow to start\\nin the morning, but runs late into the night. after appearing with\\nbruce springsteen at a rally in cleveland, followed by a stop in\\ncincinnati, obama was not scheduled to arrive at his hotel in\\njacksonville, fla., until after 1 a.m. on monday.\\n\\nif there is a whiff of nostalgia surrounding the obama campaign\\nin these final hours before the election, it doesn\\'t seem to be\\nemanating from the candidate himself. he is eager to be finished\\ncampaigning, several of his friends said, and for months has been\\nimmersing himself in the work of the presidency, well before he\\nknows if it will ever be his.\\n\\nhe spends far less time on the telephone these days making\\npolitical calls to local democratic chairmen. his call list now\\nincludes officials in washington, including treasury secretary\\nhenry m. paulson, to whom he spoke to several times a day for weeks\\nabout the government rescue plan. and he is in frequent\\nconversations with congressional leaders over how to proceed should\\nhe win on tuesday.\\n\\non saturday morning, obama met in his hotel suite at caesar\\'s\\npalace in las vegas with sen. harry reid of nevada, the majority\\nleader. they spent about 45 minutes together, with reid ticking\\nthrough a list of items sketched on a note card in his breast\\npocket.\\n\\nobama also spoke about how his life has changed, a point that\\nwas driven home on friday night when he went home to see his\\ndaughters for halloween and grew agitated when he felt that a group\\nof reporters and photographers had crowded him.\\n\\n\"he said he likes to go out trick-or-treating, but he can\\'t\\nanymore,\" reid said in an interview, recalling the conversation he\\nhad with obama. \"he said he guessed he could have worn a barack\\nobama mask.\"\\n\\none of the greatest frustrations of his candidacy -- being away\\nfrom his wife, michelle, and his two daughters, malia and sasha --\\nwill come to an end, win or lose. when his plane touched down on\\nsaturday afternoon in pueblo, colo., his step carried an extra\\nlilt. it was not because of the place that he finds himself in the\\nclosing moments of his campaign, but because his two daughters were\\nstanding on the breezy tarmac, waiting to be scooped up by their\\ndaddy.\\n\\ndana point, calif. - beyond the 300-thread-count silky bed\\nsheets, the marble bathrooms, potted

colorado rockies\\' general manager\\nsaid, \"we would like to address all of those areas.\"\\n\\ntruth is, o\\'dowd feels guilty that baseball\\'s annual general\\nmanagers\\' meetings are being held

traditional bullies: the\\nyankees, red sox and angels, with the cardinals and mets lurking.\\nhis is an interesting case. he\\'s one of the league\\'s best players\\nbut will be a marquee free agent at season\\'s end. that represents a\\ndouble whammy - price to keep him, plus price to acquire him.\\n\\nthe yankees have pieces such as starter phil hughes and second\\nbaseman robinson cano that could work, but gm brian cashman refused\\nto part with young players for johan santana last winter as he\\ntries to prevent the yankees from relying so heavily on free\\nagency.\\n\\nboston can dangle pitcher clay buchholz, but it would take a lot\\nmore. and the angels have starters joe saunders and ervin santana,\\nboth of whom the rockies like, but l.a. hasn\\'t dealt a young\\npitcher in seven years.\\n\\natkins is more marketable in some ways because he has two years\\nbefore free agency and will make roughly $6.5 million this season,\\ncompared to holliday\\'s $13.5 million. the angels\\' interest in\\natkins and holliday will be tied to their success in re-signing\\nmark teixeira. if he returns, their need for either rockie shrinks.\\n\\nthe american league central should be the epicenter for interest\\nin atkins, with the twins and indians trying to fill needs at third\\nbase and each possessing a bushel of young pitchers.\\n\\nit\\'s not too hard to see conversations

yankees, who have pitcher ian kennedy as a chip.\\n\\nbecause of the uncertain economy - frozen or reduced ticket\\nprices around the league are a solid indicator - gms are bracing\\nfor an anxious future.\\n\\nthe big deals - whether for holliday, atkins or san diego\\'s jake\\npeavy -- might have to wait until the winter meetings next month.\\nuntil then, there\\'s nothing wrong with laying groundwork with\\ncastles in the sand.\\n\\n\"the economy will be a factor,\" arizona\\'s josh byrnes said.\\n\"that\\'s why i don\\'t have a real sense if there will be a great\\ndeal of trade

files suggests that dozens of the\\napproximately 255 prisoners remaining in detention are said by\\nmilitary and intelligence agencies to have been captured with\\nimportant terrorism suspects, to have connections to top qaida\\nleaders or to have other serious terrorism credentials.\\n\\nsens. john mccain and barack obama have said they would close\\nthe detention camp. the next president will

strength of the evidence is difficult to assess, because the\\ngovernment has kept much of it secret and because of questions\\nabout whether some was gathered through torture.\\n\\nbut as a new

mccain sat in the\\nback of his campaign bus telling his favorite henny youngman jokes.\\nno one laughed harder than he did.\\n\\n\"it was one after another -- \\'take my wife, please,\"\\' said sen.\\nlindsey graham, a south carolina republican and one of mccain\\'s\\nclosest friends.\\n\\nfor 90 minutes, as his bus rumbled from the edge of lake erie to\\nyoungstown, mccain kept up the patter with graham and his\\ncampaign\\'s high command. he talked about how he once saw the old\\nborscht belt comedian perform in new jersey. he told stories about\\nmorris k. udall, the legendary arizona congressman. and he roared\\nwith graham about a book he was reading, \"a walk in the woods,\" a\\ncomic account of an out-of-shape writer\\'s 2,100-mile hike of the\\nappalachian trail.\\n\\nno one is suggesting that mccain is ecstatic that he is behind\\nin the polls or that the cognoscenti, as he puts it, \"have written\\nus off.\"\\n\\nbut in the frantic last days of his nearly two-year second quest\\nfor the presidency, mccain has liberated himself from the\\nirritable, edgy candidate of a month ago. he has, by all\\nappearances, decided he will get to tuesday by having a good time.\\n\\nhis aides say he is relieved that the race is almost over and\\nfor the most part out of his hands. he is also buoyed -- and\\nobsessed, his staff says -- with polls that show the race tightening\\nin some battleground states and allow him hope that he might still\\nhave a shot.\\n\\nhe is also now in the role that he finds at least familiar, if\\nnot comfortable -- the scrappy underdog barking at washington. it\\nwas not for nothing that his first stop thursday was in defiance,\\nohio.\\n\\n\"if we were 10 points up, we\\'d all be a little bit happier,\"\\nsaid mark

open \"saturday night live\" with tina fey.\\n\\nthere he good-naturedly mocked his circumstances in a faux qvc\\nsegment by saying he could only afford the shopping channel and not\\na half-hour of prime-time television for an infomercial like the\\none by sen. barack obama. \"look, would i rather be on three major\\nnetworks?\" mccain said. \"of course. but i\\'m a true maverick -- a\\nrepublican without money.\"\\n\\nwhatever happens on tuesday, mccain\\'s aides say he is too much a\\nstudent of history not to be astonished and humbled by his own\\nplace in it.\\n\\nas a prisoner of war in vietnam, mccain mused to his cellmates\\nabout becoming president one day. now he is amazed that a candidate\\nwho was left for politically dead a year ago has managed to\\n\"lurch\" -- his own choice of verb from a recent interview -- toward\\nthe finish line at all. that is not to say that he is about to ease\\nup on his decade-long pursuit of the white house.\\n\\n\"he wants this very badly,\" graham said.\\n\\nmccain\\'s days begin earlier than they used to, around 6 a.m.,\\nfor morning television and radio interviews that he races through\\nin 5- and 10-minute bites. afterward, the drill is the same as it\\nhas been from the start. he and his aides assemble with coffee in\\nhis hotel suite, go over the plan for the day, check out the\\nnewspapers and, lately, pore over the campaign\\'s overnight polls.\\n\\nmccain tracks every hiccup, particularly anything from his own\\npollster, bill mcinturff, that shows him edging toward obama. he\\navidly listens to campaign aides who say that if the unexcitable\\nmcinturff says he is gaining, it must be so. \"we do not have a\\nhappy-numbers pollster,\" salter said. \"we\\'ve got buzz killer.\"\\n\\nby the middle of the day, mccain likes to have news of the\\nlatest tracking polls. \"we all kind of know when rasmussen comes\\nout, and zogby,\" wallace said. \"so we all watch for it.\"\\n\\nmccain, in the meantime, is on the phone a half-dozen times each\\nwith his campaign manager, rick davis, and his top strategist,\\nsteve schmidt, wanting to know everything they are doing and\\nanything they have heard. \"he is an information sponge,\" salter\\nsaid.\\n\\nhis low point, his aides say, was the suspension of his campaign\\nin late september to make his way to washington to help negotiate a\\n$700 billion bailout of wall street, only to have the house\\nrepublicans blow the deal up in his face. his slight edge in the\\npolls evaporated, and he was described by friends as angry at\\nhimself, his campaign and the world.\\n\\ntwo and a half weeks later he was devastated, aides said, when\\nrep. john lewis, a georgia democrat and civil rights leader,\\ninvoked the segregationist george wallace to rebuke mccain for\\ntolerating insults and threats hurled at obama at his rallies.\\n\\nmccain took the edge off some of his rhetoric and has in the\\nlast few days loosened up in his speeches, although he still\\nlustily attacks obama as the tax-and-spend \"redistributionist in\\nchief\" who can not be trusted to lead the nation in crisis.\\n\\nbut the \"get off my lawn\" tone of the angry guy across the\\nstreet has at times become a more neighborly \"give me a break.\"\\n\\n\"he\\'s measuring the drapes!\" mccain shouted on a chilly\\nsaturday morning at christopher newport university in newport news,\\nva.\\n\\nthe line was a well-worn one from his stump speech about what he\\ncalls obama\\'s white house presumptions, but he delivered it\\nlaughing out loud, as if he was amusing no one more than himself.\\n\\nduring the day he gets almost no exercise, eats the candy and\\njunk food strewn all over his bus, and naps slumped in his seat in\\nthe curtained-off front section of his plane. the national\\nreporters he once called his \"base\" remain banished in the back;\\naides say he is convinced that they are all rooting for obama.\\n\\nmccain takes an ambien if he needs one, but in these last days\\nthere is scant sleep on the schedule. he planned to end sunday with\\na three-hour flight from new hampshire to a post-midnight rally in\\nmiami, then rest briefly and head to the airport for an 8 a.m.\\ndeparture for tampa.\\n\\nfrom there he was to embark on a seven-state, 18-hour odyssey\\nacross america: north to tennessee, northeast once more to\\npennsylvania, then west with the setting sun to indiana, new\\nmexico, nevada and finally home to arizona, where he will hold a\\nmidnight rally on the courthouse steps of the old territorial\\ncapital of prescott, the town where he has ended all his senate\\ncampaigns. he was set to arrive at his condominium in phoenix\\nsometime after 2 a.m. on election day.\\n\\nthere would in any case be little time for the rolling seminars\\nhe once conducted in the back of his bus. he has local reporters\\naboard for short hops, but he and cindy mccain spend far more time\\nentertaining a shifting cast of republican governors and members of\\ncongress. last week on the campaign plane, the group included gov.\\ncharlie crist and sen. mel martinez, both of florida.\\n\\nmartinez came through the curtain long enough to spin about what\\nmight have been, that if lehman brothers and the insurance giant\\naig had not foundered, \"we would still be up seven.\"\\n\\nin the evenings, graham and mccain\\'s top campaign advisers --\\nalmost all are now traveling with him -- walk the candidate to his\\nhotel room, where they go over the plan for the next day and then\\nleave him alone. mccain turns on espn and relaxes after rallies\\nthat blast out a deafening \"life is a highway\" and other campaign\\nanthems.\\n\\n\"it\\'s like being in a rock band,\" graham said. \"you do your\\ngig, and you\\'ve got to wind down a little bit.\"\\n\\nbefore monday\\'s marathon, mccain said goodbye to new hampshire,\\nthe state that gave him two primary victories and twice resurrected\\nhis candidacy. polls show obama with a double-digit lead for the\\nstate\\'s four electoral votes, and it was an odd place to devote\\nfive precious hours just a day and a half before the election.\\n\\nbut mccain loves the state. in peterborough\\'s 90-year-old town\\nhall, he jettisoned his stump speech to answer questions on\\npolitically dangerous topics like immigration reform that he has\\navoided for months. he even had praise for obama. \"i admire and\\nrespect my opponent,\" he said.\\n\\nit was a message tailored to his audience of independent-minded\\nvoters, but it was also a display of the old john mccain, or\\nperhaps of the new one of these last few days.\\n\\n\"i come to the people of new hampshire -- republicans,\\nindependents, democrats, libertarians, vegetarians,\" mccain said\\nquietly, to laughter, \"and ask again to let me go on one more\\nmission.\"\\n\\noutspent and under siege in a hostile political\\nclimate, congressional republicans scrambled this weekend to save\\nembattled incumbents in an effort to hold down expected democratic\\ngains in the house and senate on tuesday.\\n\\nsenate republicans threw their remaining resources into\\nprotecting endangered lawmakers in georgia, minnesota, mississippi,\\nnew hampshire, north carolina and oregon, while house republicans\\nwere forced to put money into what should be secure republican\\nterritory in idaho, indiana, kentucky, virginia and wyoming.\\n\\nsenate democrats were active in nine states where republicans\\nare running for re-election; house democrats, meanwhile, bought\\nadvertising in 63 districts, twice the number of districts where\\nrepublicans bought advertisements and helped candidates.\\n\\n\"we are deep in the red areas,\" rep. chris van hollen of\\nmaryland, chairman of the democratic congressional campaign\\ncommittee, said on sunday. \"we are competing now in districts\\ngeorge bush carried by large margins in 2004.\"\\n\\nwhat seems especially striking about this year\\'s congressional\\nraces is that democrats appear to have solidified their gains from\\nthe 2006 midterm elections and are pushing beyond their traditional\\nurban turf into what once were safe republican strongholds,\\ncreating a struggle for the suburbs.\\n\\nwith many of the most contested house races occurring in\\nrepublican-held districts that extend beyond cities in states like\\nflorida, michigan, minnesota and ohio, democrats said expected\\nvictories would give them dominance in the suburbs -- the\\ntraditional foundation of republican power in the house..\\n\\nthe same is true for senate democratic candidates, who are\\nseeking to nail down swing counties outside urban centers and move\\nthe party toward a 60-vote majority that could overcome a\\nfilibuster.\\n\\nthe partisan spending gap was stark. as of last week, senate\\ndemocrats had spent more than $67 million against republican\\ncandidates, compared with $33.7 million in advertising by\\nrepublicans. in the house, the democratic congressional campaign\\ncommittee had spent $73 million, compared with just over $20\\nmillion for the national republican congressional committee.\\n\\nmost of the house republican money was spent on behalf of\\nincumbents or in districts where a republican is retiring,\\nemphasizing how much the party was playing defense. by contrast,\\nhouse democrats spent most of their money in the last month going\\nafter republican seats in colorado, nebraska, washington, west\\nvirginia and elsewhere.\\n\\ngov. jim gibbons of nevada has been cleared by the justice\\ndepartment of any wrongdoing in connection with an inquiry into\\nwhether he helped a friend win defense contracts in exchange for\\ngifts, gibbons\\' lawyer said.\\n\\nthe lawyer, abbe d. lowell, said the lead prosecutor in the case\\ninformed gibbons on friday that no charges would be filed and that\\nthe investigation, related to gibbons\\' work as a congressman before\\nhe was elected governor in 2006, had been closed.\\n\\na justice department spokeswoman, laura sweeney, said the\\ndepartment would not comment.\\n\\nlowell said gibbons, a republican whose first term as governor\\nhas been dogged by legal, political and personal troubles, would\\nmake a statement on monday.\\n\\nthe investigation spanned 18 months, lowell said, and began when\\na former staff member of a technology company run by a friend of\\nthe governor made accusations of influence peddling.\\n\\nthe former staff member, dennis montgomery, told news media\\noutlets that his boss, warren trepp, the owner of etreppid\\ntechnologies, had given gibbons money, casino chips and a caribbean\\ncruise to help etreppid win defense department contracts.\\n\\nlowell called the accusations \"ridiculous\" and \"hogwash\" and\\nsaid, \"the governor does not even gamble.\"\\n\\n\"neither the governor nor i,\" lowell added, \"have any problem\\nwith the justice department having to investigate allegations, even\\nif they are crazy, because he is a high-ranking public official and\\nhe knows the world he lives in.\\n\\n\"they handled it in a way and a speed that was up to them.\\nthough we wish it were sooner, they came to the right conclusion.\"\\n\\nlowell said gibbons had cooperated in the investigation and in\\nrecent months had been interviewed by fbi agents.\\n\\nthe investigation, lowell said, might have been slowed by a\\ncivil lawsuit between montgomery and etreppid, which was settled\\nlast month.\\n\\nblxware llc, the company where montgomery works, said the terms\\nof the settlement were confidential, but the company, based in\\nbellevue, wash., disclosed that the agreement included a payment to\\ntrepp as \"compensation for certain allegations\" made against him\\nin the news media.\\n\\nthe closing of the investigation provides welcome news to\\ngibbons in a trying period.\\n\\na former cocktail waitress filed a lawsuit against him last\\nmonth, alleging that he pushed her and threatened to rape her after\\na night of drinking in las vegas just before the november 2006\\nelection. gibbons denied the accusation, and criminal charges were\\nnot filed.\\n\\ngibbons, 63, and his wife, dawn, 54, began divorce proceedings\\nthis year after 22 years of marriage. the news media in nevada have\\nmade much of her accusation of adultery and the disclosure of\\nhundreds of text messages he sent to a woman he has said was a\\nfriend but who dawn gibbons\\' lawyers suggest was a mistress.\\n\\na state employee filed a lawsuit last month claiming that she\\nwas removed from her post on the belief that she had leaked the\\nmessages.\\n\\nmicrosoft plans to report on monday that the security of its\\nwindows operating system has significantly improved, while at the\\nsame time the threat of computer viruses, fraud and other online\\nscourges has become much more serious.\\n\\nthe company blames organized crime, naive users and its\\ncompetitors for the deteriorating situation.\\n\\nin the latest edition of its twice-a-year security intelligence\\nreport, microsoft said that the amount of malicious or potentially\\nharmful software removed from windows computers grew by 43 percent\\nduring the first half of 2008.\\n\\nthe company said improvements in security for its windows vista\\noperating system and security updates to the previous windows xp\\nsystem had made such software a less attractive target for\\nattackers. instead they have shifted their attention to security\\nholes in individual programs.\\n\\nduring the first half of the year, 90 percent of newly reported\\nvulnerabilities involved applications, and only 10 percent affected\\noperating systems, according to the report.\\n\\nmicrosoft executives said they were pleased with the progress\\nmade since the company was shaken by a series of destructive\\nprograms that spread rapidly around the world over the internet\\nbeginning in 2003. but they said that unless software development\\npractices change throughout the industry, any improvements in the\\nsecurity of windows would be meaningless.\\n\\n\"this story is real,\" said george stathakopoulos, general\\nmanager for microsoft\\'s security engineering and communications\\ngroup, referring to the improvement in the company\\'s engineering\\npractices. \"now we have a third-party problem and it\\'s something\\nwe have to go solve.\"\\n\\nsecurity researchers said they were sympathetic to microsoft\\'s\\nplight.\\n\\n\"the only thing that microsoft can patch is their own\\nsoftware,\" said patrik runald, chief security adviser for\\nf-secure, a computer security firm in finland. \"that\\'s not what\\nthe bad guys are using to get into computers these days. it\\'s\\ncertainly a challenge.\"\\n\\nmicrosoft and the computer industry have also been unable to\\nsolve the so-called dancing pony problem. that refers to the\\npropensity of many computer users to click on enticing links in\\ntheir e-mail or to visit seductive but malicious web sites, leaving\\nthem vulnerable to trojan horse downloads and other infections.\\n\\nover the last three years the computer security industry has\\nbeen fighting a losing battle, as the ability of computer criminals\\nto profit from identity theft and a variety of other scams has led\\nto the development of a robust underground industry generating\\nviruses and other so-called malware.\\n\\nmicrosoft has tried to combat the problem by building a variety\\nof safeguards into its operating systems and its internet explorer\\nbrowser, with mixed success. the user account control feature of\\nwindows vista, which popped up an endless stream of warnings that\\nirritated users, proved to be one of the key factors in the poor\\nreception for vista. last week in los angeles, the company said it\\nhad entirely reworked the user interface of its new windows 7\\noperating system to minimize user frustration.\\n\\nin comparing web browser vulnerabilities in windows xp and\\nwindows vista in the first half of the year, the new report found\\nthat while microsoft could be blamed for half of the top 10\\nvulnerabilities in windows xp, the top 10 browser vulnerabilities\\nunder vista all came from third-party add-on software from\\ncompanies like apple and realnetworks.\\n\\na companion report published by jeffrey r. jones, a microsoft\\nsecurity director, claims that microsoft is fixing security-related\\nbugs about three times as fast as three of its rivals: apple,\\nubuntu and red hat.\\n\\nan apple spokesman, bill evans, said microsoft had previously\\nissued similar reports and declined to comment beyond saying that\\nthe data was not supported by users\\' experience of infections.\\n\\nmicrosoft has a unique vantage point from which to monitor the\\nworld of malware and other threats because it receives automated\\ndata both from free software it has given to users, like the\\nmalicious software removal tool, and from specialized internet\\nreporting systems that monitor threats. it also receives data about\\ncrashes on more than a half-billion personal computers.\\n\\nthe current report indicates that malware infection rates are\\ngenerally higher in developing countries and regions than in\\ndeveloped ones. infection rates range from 1.8 for every 1,000\\ncomputers in japan to above 76.4 for every 1,000 in afghanistan.\\nthe united states had an infection rate of 11.2 infected computers\\nfor every 1,000 scanned, an increase of 25.5 percent in the last\\nsix months.\\n\\nsomewhere in a corner of northeastern ohio,\\njust five days before the presidential election that more than a\\nfew pundits have declared he will lose, sen. john mccain sat in the\\nback of his campaign bus telling his favorite henny youngman jokes.\\nno one laughed harder than he did.\\n\\nno one is suggesting that mccain is ecstatic that he is behind\\nin the polls or that the cognoscenti, as he puts it, \"have written\\nus off.\"\\n\\nbut in the frantic last days of his nearly two-year second quest\\nfor the presidency, mccain has liberated himself from the\\nirritable, edgy candidate of a month ago. he has, by all\\nappearances, decided he will get to tuesday by having a good time.\\n\\n\"if we were 10 points up, we\\'d all be a little bit happier,\"\\nsaid mark salter, one of mccain\\'s closest aides. \"but you throw a\\nlot of stuff at the guy, and he fights all the harder.\"\\n\\nmccain\\'s days begin earlier than they used to, around 6 a.m.,\\nfor morning television and radio interviews

phoenix\\nsometime after 2 a.m. on election day.\\n\\nas sen. barack obama spends the last of hundreds of millions of\\ndollars donated to his presidential campaign, the debate over how\\nfuture campaigns will be financed is set to begin in earnest.\\n\\nboth candidates have campaigned as reformers and declared that\\nrestoring the public financing system for presidential campaigns\\nwould be a priority in their administration. but obama apparently\\ndid not absorb much by way of political cost when he broke a pledge\\nto accept public financing if his opponent did as well.\\n\\nobama built a huge financial advantage over the republican\\nnominee, sen. john mccain, which may have written the epitaph for\\nthe current system.\\n\\ndemocrats, in particular, who have traditionally supported\\nlimits on campaign spending, are grappling with whether they can\\nembrace obama\\'s example without being seen as hypocritical. they\\nare keenly aware that they have developed through the internet a\\ncommanding fundraising advantage over republicans, much like the\\ndirect-mail money machine that conservatives used to lord over\\nthem.\\n\\n\"i think there is going to be tremendous reluctance on our side\\nto yield any of that advantage,\" said tad devine, who was a senior\\nstrategist for sen. john f. kerry\\'s presidential campaign in 2004.\\n\\nan oct. 28 usa today-gallup poll found most americans did not\\neven know who was taking public financing and who was not; only\\nmccain opted for the $84 million in public financing. but the\\nsurvey also found most of those polled supported limits on campaign\\nspending.\\n\\nhouse and senate leadership aides said it was highly unlikely\\nthat the issue would earn much attention next year, given other\\npriorities like the economy and the war in iraq. there is also the\\nmatter of the brewing debate among democrats, who will probably\\ncontrol congress, over whether such limits are even warranted.\\n\\nadvocates for tighter restrictions on campaign finance said they\\nwere alarmed by the more than $1.5 billion that had been raised by\\nthe presidential candidates in this year\\'s primary and general\\nelections -- the first time the presidential aspirants have topped\\n$1 billion. (the obama campaign raised $640 million, the mccain\\ncamp less than $250 million.)\\n\\nthe advocates said that they were poised to begin aggressively\\nlobbying for changes to the public financing system and that they\\nhoped the issue would be taken up quickly by the new president and\\ncongress.\\n\\nchinese regulators said over the weekend that\\nthey had confiscated and destroyed more than 3,600 tons of animal\\nfeed tainted with melamine, an industrial chemical that has\\ncontaminated food supplies in china and led to global recalls of\\nchinese dairy products.\\n\\nin what appeared to be china\\'s biggest food safety crackdown in\\nyears, the government also said saturday that it had closed 238\\nfeed makers in a series of nationwide sweeps that involved more\\nthan 369,000 government inspectors.\\n\\nthe aggressive moves come amid growing worries that the animal\\nfeed industry could be contaminated by melamine, endangering the\\nnational food supply and posing a health threat to consumers.\\n\\nin the past week and a half, eggs produced in three provinces\\nwere found to be tainted with high levels of melamine. and in\\nseptember, melamine-tainted infant formula supplies were blamed for\\nsickening more than 50,000 children and causing at least four\\ndeaths.\\n\\nregulators in the southern province of guangdong, which has\\nabout 80 million people and is a major manufacturing center near\\nhong kong, said they had discovered 6 tons of melamine-tainted\\nanimal feed.\\n\\nan official at the agriculture ministry said that the government\\nwould mete out harsh punishment to those who were deliberately\\nadding melamine to animal feed.\\n\\nbut government officials also said that china\\'s animal feed\\nsupply was largely safe and that the quality of feed had improved\\nin recent years. they insisted that only a small number of rogue\\noperators had deliberately added melamine to feed, often using it\\nas cheap filler to save money.\\n\\nthe government response was similarly reassuring early last year\\nwhen several animal feed makers were caught exporting\\nmelamine-tainted feed ingredients to the united states and other\\ncountries, resulting in contaminated pet food supplies that\\nsickened and killed cats and dogs.\\n\\nthat case led to the largest pet food recall in american\\nhistory. melamine dealers in china said in interviews last year and\\nas recently as friday that it was not uncommon for animal feed\\nproducers to buy melamine scrap, the cheaper waste left over after\\nproducing melamine products, and to use it as filler.\\n\\nstill, some food safety officials are asking consumers not to be\\ntoo alarmed. although the contaminated eggs found in hong kong\\nexceeded the government limit for melamine, a young child would\\nhave to consume about two dozen of the eggs in a single day to\\nbecome sick, they said.\\n\\neight paramilitary soldiers were killed\\nand five were wounded sunday morning when a suicide bomber rammed\\nan explosives-laden truck into a security checkpoint in the restive\\nsouth waziristan tribal region, officials said.\\n\\nalso on sunday, gen. david h. petraeus, the new chief of the\\ncentral command, made his first visit to pakistan for talks with\\ntop political and military leaders. the relationship between\\npakistan and the united states has worsened in recent weeks after a\\nstring of american strikes in pakistan on militant hide-outs.\\n\\npetraeus, credited with turning around the war in iraq, was\\naccompanied by richard a. boucher, the assistant secretary of state\\nfor south asia. no details on their schedule were released.\\n\\nthe truck bombing took place around 9:30 a.m. sunday at a post\\nnear fort zalai, a base for the paramilitary frontier corps about\\n12 miles from wana, south waziristan\\'s capital.\\n\\nthe attack, apparently retaliation for deadly missile strikes\\nreported friday, may affect an agreement between militants and\\npakistan\\'s government.\\n\\n\"the attack could be a warning call to islamabad from maulvi\\nnazir,\" said arif rafiq, a political analyst, referring to a local\\nmilitant. nazir, the taliban\\'s top commander in south waziristan,\\nwas reportedly the target of a missile strike from a remotely\\npiloted aircraft on friday.\\n\\nsouth waziristan, on the afghan border, is known as a stronghold\\nfor taliban militants and sympathizers of al-qaida.\\n\\non sunday, the news, one of pakistan\\'s leading english-language\\nnewspapers, reported that militants in south waziristan had\\nthreatened to scrap a peace accord with the government if the\\nunited states did not halt air attacks against militant leaders.\\n\\nmuch of south africa\\'s self-image\\nis built on the iconography of the african national congress: the\\nlong walk to freedom, the devotion to democratic principles, the\\nracially tolerant rainbow nation of nelson mandela. in the three\\nnational elections since the end of apartheid, the anc has won each\\ntime with the overwhelming support of voters.\\n\\nso this weekend\\'s convention led by an anc breakaway faction was\\nsomewhat jarring. dissidents repeatedly described the party they\\nonce loved as now being authoritarian, hypocritical and corrupt.\\nleaders at the convention predicted a stream of defections -- and\\nvictory for their group in elections next year.\\n\\n\"we are starting on the basis that we want to become the next\\ngovernment, in the provinces and nationally,\" mbhazima shilowa,\\none of the main dissidents and the former premier of gauteng\\nprovince, said sunday at a news conference meant to trumpet what\\nthe convention had accomplished.\\n\\nindeed, this weekend may go down in south african history as a\\nwatershed, a time when 6,400 delegates from around the nation\\ncharted a new political course that loosened the anc\\'s grip. then\\nagain, the movement might turn out to be a flop, a lot of batting\\nof wings without any sustained takeoff.\\n\\nthe months ahead will tell the tale. a tug of war is under way\\nfor the loyalty of party members. there are rumors, whispers,\\nguesses. the sunday times, one of the country\\'s leading newspapers,\\nreports that 100 anc members of parliament are preparing to desert\\nthe party. the insurrection is thought to be biggest in the\\nprovinces of eastern cape, western cape and northern cape.\\n\\nshilowa coyly boasted, \"there will be some resignations today,\\nand there will be some tomorrow and some on tuesday going\\nonwards.\"\\n\\nif anc leaders are worried, they manage a brave face in public.\\n\\n\"the wealthy gathered yesterday at their fancy convention\" in\\nthe suburbs, jacob zuma, the party president, derisively remarked\\nsunday at a rally in the township of soweto that drew about 20,000\\npeople. \"there\\'s not much they said.\"\\n\\na cell phone was pressed to sen. barack\\nobama\\'s ear as he slouched down in a black leather chair in the\\nfront cabin of his campaign airplane. he leaned away from the\\nheadrest, where his name is spelled out in blue stitching.\\n\\na few miles away, thousands of people streamed into jfk stadium\\nat parkview high school for a late-night rally on saturday. but\\nobama stayed on his chartered boeing 757 as he spoke by conference\\ncall to thousands of his team leaders around the country, the\\nvolunteers who form the ranks of an army that he hopes will give\\nhim an edge in the waning hours of the presidential race.\\n\\nas he pressed his right hand to his forehead, his sober\\nexpression seemed at odds with the confident gleam in the eyes of\\nhis advisers. while obama smiles less than he once did, gauging his\\nmood simply by looking at him is risky for a man whose flat-line\\ntemperament has seldom spiked along the rocky points of his\\njourney.\\n\\nin a campaign where he has slogged through more competitive\\nelection days than any recent nominee, only one more lies ahead.\\nand it is the long path of the democratic primary, which lurched\\nfrom the ups of iowa to the downs of ohio, that his friends say\\nprovided obama with a steady equilibrium as he enters this final\\nturn in the race for the white house.\\n\\n\"as painful as the primary season was and how agitating it\\ncould be, it turned out to be a blessing for him,\" said eric\\nwhitaker, a longtime friend from chicago who joined obama aboard\\nthe crowded campaign plane for the last three days. \"but my role\\nnow is to keep him loose. there\\'s a lot going on in his world.\"\\n\\nthe lines in obama\\'s face have grown a bit deeper since he\\nstarted his campaign, with the notches of gray hair along his\\ntemples far more pronounced. he often carries the look of\\nexhaustion, but flying the other night to nevada, where he arrived\\nafter midnight, obama passed on the chance to take much of a nap.\\n\\ninstead, he walked around the cabin of his airplane, which is\\nabout the size of a bedroom, and talked about a favorite diversion\\n-- the coming basketball season -- as he took care not to step on a\\nsenior foreign policy adviser, mark lippert, who was asleep on the\\nfloor.\\n\\nin the last days on the trail, he is finishing \"ghost wars: the\\nsecret history of the cia, afghanistan and bin laden,\" and taking\\nan occasional glance at us weekly. he reads at least two newspapers\\na day, vigilantly checks his blackberry for updates on early-voting\\ntallies and browses briefing books.\\n\\n\"in a marathon, when you are on mile 20 you start getting\\ntired, but when you are on mile 25 you don\\'t,\" said lippert, who\\nhas grown familiar with obama\\'s travel rhythms while accompanying\\nhim on the four foreign trips he has taken since becoming a\\nsenator. \"that\\'s where he\\'s at.\"\\n\\nwhatever emotion he feels as his candidacy draws to a close, he\\ndisplays little of it, either in public appearances or private\\nconversations with his close advisers. the air of confidence that\\nhe exudes, which some critics castigate as arrogance, grew in part\\nout of the primary, when he worked to avoid perceptions that he was\\nweak or not ready.\\n\\nbut now, he is described by friends as feeling as though he has\\nbeen thoroughly tested and is prepared to take on the job he has\\nspent 22 months fighting for. still, it is hard for even those\\nclosest to obama to fathom what these days are precisely like, even\\nfor the imperturbable -- often inscrutable -- senator from illinois.\\n\\nhis world is awash in powerful, conflicting emotions: the\\nrealization, presumably, that he may be about to become president;\\nthe huge optimism that he has unleashed, evident in the crowds he\\nis drawing (and something he has told aides worries him a bit,\\ngiven the expectations set for him); the weighty thinking he is\\ngradually giving to how he would staff a government and deal with a\\ntransition in such a difficult time. all of this is taking place at\\na time where the woman who played a large role in raising him, his\\ngrandmother, is approaching death.\\n\\n\"what if i disappoint people?\" valerie jarrett, a close friend\\nand adviser, recalled obama asking at several points throughout the\\ncampaign. \"that\\'s what gives him the energy to keep getting up\\nevery day.\" it has been months since obama has ventured with any\\nregularity to the back of his plane where the journalists sit. (the\\none time he played the board game taboo on a cross-country flight\\nto oregon is a distant memory.) he has not taken questions for so\\nlong that reporters have taken to shouting at him as he boards his\\nplane. as he climbed up the steps of his airplane here on sunday\\nmorning, headed for ohio, a reporter shouted to question why he\\nhadn\\'t held a news conference in weeks.\\n\\n\"i will,\" obama said. \"on wednesday.\"\\n\\non a final weekend pass through electoral battlegrounds that\\nspanned three time zones, the electoral climate and his campaign\\norganization provide him the luxury of focusing on states that\\nfavored the republican ticket four years ago. but when his\\ndemocratic crowds jeer at the mere mention of sen. john mccain, he\\noffers a gentle scolding: \"you don\\'t need to boo, you just need to\\nvote!\"\\n\\nit is a true crowd-pleaser, and he reprises it in city after\\ncity.\\n\\nhis crowds have rarely been larger or more enthusiastic -- often,\\nperhaps, more outwardly so than the candidate himself. these days,\\nobama is racing through his speeches, whittling down a message that\\nonce stretched for more than an hour to a disciplined 30 minutes.\\nhe works the rope line at every stop, but taking a closer look you\\nrealize that it\\'s as much for a few photographs as for a lot of\\nhandshakes. at each event, though, he stays long enough to sign a\\nstack of books for supporters.\\n\\nduring a rally outside orlando, fla., the other night, where he\\nwas joined for the first time on stage by former president bill\\nclinton, he was visibly chilly in the unusually cool air with a\\ntemperature that dipped into the 40s. he had hoped to wear a coat,\\nbut clinton did not, so obama came to the stage without one. not so\\nthe next night in virginia, where a cool and damp chill also hung\\nin the air.\\n\\n\"i did decide to wear a coat, because you want a president who\\nhas sense,\" obama told the crowd from behind the podium, where he\\nwas covered in a black wool overcoat.\\n\\nwhile he may not be coasting to the finish line, he\\'s not\\nrunning as hard as he did during his battle with sen. hillary\\nrodham clinton for the democratic nomination. on sunday, he was in\\nthe gym of the doubletree hotel here shortly after 6 a.m., but he\\nspent some time with his wife and daughters before boarding his\\nplane at 9:30 a.m. he didn\\'t arrive for his first public event of\\nthe day at the ohio statehouse in columbus until 1 p.m.\\n\\nhis campaign schedule, like obama himself, can be slow to start\\nin the morning, but runs late into the night. after appearing with\\nbruce springsteen at a rally in cleveland, followed by a stop in\\ncincinnati, obama was not scheduled to arrive at his hotel in\\njacksonville, fla., until after 1 a.m. on monday.\\n\\nif there is a whiff of nostalgia surrounding the obama campaign\\nin these final hours before the election, it doesn\\'t seem to be\\nemanating from the candidate himself. he is eager to be finished\\ncampaigning, several of his friends said, and for months has been\\nimmersing himself in the work of the presidency, well before he\\nknows if it will ever be his.\\n\\nhe spends far less time on the telephone these days making\\npolitical calls to local democratic chairmen. his call list now\\nincludes officials in washington, including treasury secretary\\nhenry m. paulson jr., to whom he spoke to several times a day for\\nweeks about the government rescue plan. and he is in frequent\\nconversations with congressional leaders over how to proceed should\\nhe win on tuesday.\\n\\non saturday morning, obama met in his hotel suite at caesar\\'s\\npalace in las vegas with sen. harry reid of nevada, the majority\\nleader. they spent about 45 minutes together, with reid ticking\\nthrough a list of items sketched on a note card in his breast\\npocket.\\n\\nobama also spoke about how his life has changed, a point that\\nwas driven home on friday night when he went home to see his\\ndaughters for halloween and grew agitated when he felt that a group\\nof reporters and photographers had crowded him.\\n\\n\"he said he likes to go out trick-or-treating, but he can\\'t\\nanymore,\" reid said in an interview, recalling the conversation he\\nhad with obama. \"he said he guessed he could have worn a barack\\nobama mask.\"\\n\\none of the greatest frustrations of his candidacy -- being away\\nfrom his wife, michelle, and his two daughters, malia and sasha --\\nwill come to an end, win or lose. when his plane touched down on\\nsaturday afternoon in pueblo, colo., his step carried an extra\\nlilt. it was not because of the place that he finds himself in the\\nclosing moments of his campaign, but because his two daughters were\\nstanding on the breezy tarmac, waiting to be scooped up by their\\ndaddy.\\n\\na cell phone was pressed to sen. barack\\nobama\\'s ear as he slouched down in a black leather chair in the\\nfront cabin of his campaign airplane. a few miles away, thousands\\nof people streamed into jfk stadium at parkview high school for a\\nlate-night rally on saturday. but obama stayed on his chartered\\nboeing 757 as he spoke by conference call to thousands of his team\\nleaders around the country, the volunteers who form the ranks of an\\narmy that he hopes will give him an edge in the waning hours of the\\npresidential race.\\n\\nas he pressed his right hand to his forehead, his sober\\nexpression seemed at odds with the confident gleam in the eyes of\\nhis advisers. while obama smiles less than he once did, gauging his\\nmood simply by looking at him is risky for a man whose flat-line\\ntemperament has seldom spiked along the rocky points of his\\njourney.\\n\\nthe lines in obama\\'s face have grown a bit deeper since he\\nstarted his campaign, with the notches of gray hair along his\\ntemples far more pronounced. he often carries the look of\\nexhaustion. but whatever emotion he feels as his candidacy draws to\\na close, he displays little of it. it is hard for even those\\nclosest to obama to fathom what these days are precisely like for\\nhim.\\n\\nhis world is awash in powerful, conflicting emotions: the\\nrealization, presumably, that he may be about to become president;\\nthe huge optimism that he has unleashed, evident in the crowds he\\nis drawing (and something he has told aides worries him a bit,\\ngiven the expectations set for him); the weighty thinking he is\\ngradually giving to how he would staff a government and deal with a\\ntransition in such a difficult time. all of this is taking place at\\na time where the woman who played a large role in raising him, his\\ngrandmother, is approaching death.\\n\\n\"what if i disappoint people?\" valerie jarrett, a close friend\\nand adviser, recalled obama asking at several points throughout the\\ncampaign. \"that\\'s what gives him the energy to keep getting up\\nevery day.\"\\n\\nas he climbed up the steps of his airplane here on sunday\\nmorning, headed for ohio, a reporter shouted to question why he\\nhadn\\'t held a news conference in weeks.\\n\\n\"i will,\" obama said. \"on wednesday.\"\\n\\nafter years of unfettered growth in military\\nbudgets, defense department planners, top commanders and weapons\\nmanufacturers now say they are almost certain that the financial\\nmeltdown will have a serious impact on future pentagon spending.\\n\\ncivilian and military budget planners say that they are already\\nanalyzing worst-case contingency spending plans that would freeze\\nor slash their overall budgets.\\n\\nthe obvious targets for savings would be expensive new arms\\nprograms, which have racked up cost overruns of at least $300\\nbillion for the top 75 weapons systems, according to the government\\naccountability office. congressional budget experts say likely\\ntargets for reductions are the army\\'s plans for fielding advanced\\ncombat systems, the air force\\'s joint strike fighter, the navy\\'s\\nnew destroyer and the ground-based missile defense system.\\n\\nthe pentagon\\'s annual base budget for standard operations has\\nreached more than $500 billion, the highest level since world war\\nii when adjusted for inflation.\\n\\non top of that figure, supplemental spending for the wars in\\niraq and afghanistan has topped $100 billion each year. in all, the\\ndefense department now accounts for half of the government\\'s total\\ndiscretionary spending.\\n\\non the presidential campaign trail, sens. john mccain and barack\\nobama have pledged to cut fat without carving into the muscle of\\nnational security. both have said they would protect the overall\\nlevel of military spending, and mccain has further pledged to add\\nmore troops to the roster of the armed services beyond the 92,000\\nnow advocated by the pentagon, an increase endorsed by obama.\\n\\nsome critics say it would be much easier to cut military\\nspending than programs like social security and medicare at a time\\nwhen retirement savings are dwindling because of the financial\\ncrisis. rep. barney frank, d-mass., the chairman of the house\\nfinancial services committee, has raised the idea of reducing\\nmilitary spending by 25 percent.\\n\\ndefense secretary robert m. gates has warned against repeating\\nhistoric trends, in which the nation cut money for the armed\\nservices after a period of warfare.\\n\\n\"we basically gutted our military after world war i, after\\nworld war ii, in certain ways after korea, certainly after vietnam\\nand after the end of the cold war,\" gates said. \"experience is\\nthe ability to recognize a mistake when you make it again.\"\\n\\ngates acknowledges that military spending is almost certain to\\nlevel off, and he expressed a goal that the pentagon budget at\\nleast keep pace with inflation over coming years.\\n\\nshortly after 9 a.m. on oct. 19, colin powell endorsed barack\\nobama for president during the taping of \"meet the press\" on nbc.\\nwithin minutes, the video was on the web.\\n\\nbut the clip was not rushed onto youtube; it was msnbc.com, the\\nnetwork\\'s sister entity online, that showed the video hours before\\ntelevision viewers on the west coast could watch the interview for\\nthemselves.\\n\\nold media, apparently, can learn new media tricks. not since\\n1960, when john f. kennedy won in part because of the increasingly\\npopular medium of television, has changing technology had such an\\nimpact on the political campaigns and the organizations covering\\nthem.\\n\\nfor many viewers, the 2008 election has become a kind of hybrid\\nin which the dividing line between online and off, broadcast and\\ncable, pop culture and civic culture, has been all but obliterated.\\n\\nmany of the media outlets influencing the 2008 election simply\\nwere not around in 2004. youtube did not exist, and facebook barely\\nreached beyond the ivy league. there was no huffington post to\\nencourage citizen reporters, so obama\\'s comment about voters\\nclinging to guns or religion may have passed unnoticed. these sites\\nand countless others have redefined how many americans get their\\npolitical news.\\n\\nwhen viewers settle in tuesday night to watch the election\\nreturns, they will also check text messages for alerts, browse the\\nweb for exit poll results and watch videos distributed by the\\ncampaigns. and many folks will let go of the mouse only to pick up\\nthe remote and sample an array of cable channels with election\\ncoverage -- from comedy central to bbc america.\\n\\nbut as nbc\\'s decision to release the powell clip early shows,\\nthe networks and their newspaper counterparts have not simply\\nwaited to be overtaken. instead, they have made specific efforts to\\nengage audiences with interactive features, allowing their content\\nto be used in unanticipated ways, and in many efforts, breaking out\\nof the boundaries of the morning paper and the evening newscast.\\n\\n\"old media outlets -- the networks, the newspapers -- learned a\\nlot of lessons from the last cycle and didn\\'t allow others to own\\nthe online space this time,\" said rick klein, the senior political\\nreporter for abc news.\\n\\nsome of those lessons have been painful. consider what has\\nchanged since the last presidential election. four years ago, the\\nnetwork news operations were still the go-to source on election\\nnight, with a total audience of 38 million in prime time, compared\\nwith 17 million for the three cable news channels. on tuesday, the\\nratings race will surely be tighter. on a historic night in august,\\nwhen a black man became the first endorsed candidate of a major\\npolitical party, the biggest audience of all belonged to cnn.\\n\\n\"some of this began back in 2006, but i think that cable news\\nhas transformed the way that elections are covered,\" said david\\nbohrman, the washington bureau chief for cnn. \"i don\\'t think\\nnetworks are irrelevant, but network news is less relevant than it\\nhas been.\"\\n\\nbut those who suggest that 2008 is a postnetwork affair should\\nconsider that, while gov. sarah palin of alaska was something of a\\nfixation on the web, it was her interview with katie couric, the\\nanchor of the \"cbs evening news,\" and the impersonation by tina\\nfey on nbc\\'s \"saturday night live,\" that defined her in the\\npublic imagination. when obama\\'s campaign sought to make one last\\npush with a 30-minute infomercial, it bought time on three major\\nnetworks, using money harvested on one platform -- the web -- to buy\\ntime on another -- broadcast television.\\n\\n\"we should be careful of these zero-sum games where the new\\nmedia drives out the old,\" said andrew heyward, a former president\\nof cbs news who is now a senior adviser to marketspace, a\\nconsulting firm owned by the monitor group. \"i think what we see\\nis growing sophistication about making the channels work together\\neffectively.\"\\n\\nthe republicans have made a habit of running against the media\\nin elections past. this year, the mainstream media found itself at\\ntimes running against both parties. perhaps drawing on obama\\'s\\nbackground as a community organizer, his campaign decided early on\\nto build a social network that would flank, and in some cases\\noutflank, traditional news media.\\n\\nwith a facebook group that had 2.3 million adherents and a huge\\npush on youtube -- last week alone, the campaign uploaded 70 videos,\\nmany of them tailored to battleground states -- the campaign used\\npeer-to-peer communication to build a juggernaut that did not\\ndepend on the whims and choices of the media\\'s collective brain\\ntrust.\\n\\nthe campaign mined its online community not just for money, but\\nfor content. a video titled \"four days in denver\" about the obama\\ncampaign had the kind of access that journalists would kill for,\\nincluding the candidate working over his acceptance speech with a\\nstaff member and showing the family backstage making ready for\\ntheir moment in the spotlight.\\n\\nit looked like a big-time network get, but it was produced by\\nthe campaign itself.\\n\\n\"we\\'re constantly experimenting with videos,\" said joe\\nrospars, obama\\'s new-media director. \"there aren\\'t hard and fast\\nrules about what will inspire supporters or explain things\\nclearly.\" the most popular videos on barackobama.com weren\\'t tv\\nads; they were biographical videos and web-only recordings.\\n\\nmccain, in part because he appealed to a less digital\\ndemographic, made sparser use of the web, but republicans were not\\nimmune to the charms of new media. the web never forgets, giving\\nnew life to events from several years ago.\\n\\n\"no one knows the impact of quasi-permanency on the web yet,\\nbut it surely has changed the political world,\" said allan louden,\\na professor who teaches a course on digital politics at wake forest\\nuniversity. \"the role of gatekeepers and archivists have been\\ndispersed to everyone with internet access.\"\\n\\nand late last month, the mccain campaign solicited users to come\\nup with their own joe the plumber videos and showed the results on\\nits web site.\\n\\n\"i think that this time around, campaigns got used to the fact\\nthat anything that they put out there could be pirated, remixed,\\nmashed-up and recirculated,\" said henry jenkins, the author of\\n\"convergence culture: where old and new media collide\" and a\\nprofessor at the massachusetts institute of technology. \"it is a\\nmuch more rapid environment.\"\\n\\nraw footage of political speeches -- which no network except\\nc-span considers hot content -- racked up huge numbers. with 5\\nmillion views since march, obama\\'s 37-minute speech about race is\\nthe most popular video on his youtube channel.\\n\\nto compete, major media companies had to change how they\\nproduced their coverage. before almost every big interview of the\\nyear -- abc\\'s interview with john edwards about his extramarital\\naffair, for instance -- the networks released excerpts on their web\\nsites.\\n\\n\"snl\" videos proved to be particularly popular online; fey\\'s\\nimpressions were viewed more than 50 million times.\\n\\n\"the idea that something can be seen more online than on tv,\\nand arguably have more influence that way, is a tipping point,\"\\nheyward said.\\n\\npolitically oriented video, much of it topical and much of the\\njuicier bits lifted from network programming, is everywhere on the\\nweb. youtube videos mentioning either obama or mccain have been\\nviewed 2.3 billion times, according to the measurement firm\\ntubemogul. a pew research center survey conducted in october found\\nthat 39 percent of registered voters had watched campaign videos\\nonline.\\n\\n\"what is striking here is not the dominance of any one medium,\\nbut the integration of various channels,\" said lee rainie, the\\ndirector of the pew internet &amp;amp; american life project.\\n\\nby the time the conventions rolled around, some networks\\nrealized the game had changed. couric christened her own youtube\\nchannel and was turned loose in web extras. but network news\\ndivisions are expensive operations based on a television business\\nmodel. they can\\'t be run on the relatively small money that online\\nadvertising draws but they can\\'t compete for audiences if they\\nignore the web.\\n\\n\"at a time when almost anyone can check voter turnout in\\ncertain neighborhoods in cuyahoga county, i don\\'t think everyone is\\ngoing to sit there and wait to be spoon-fed the election results in\\nthe order brian williams thinks is appropriate,\" said joan walsh,\\nthe editor of salon and a frequent television commentator on the\\nelection, referring to a closely watched county in ohio.\\n\\nperhaps the only thing that could be predicted with any\\nreliability is that, viewers who now watch cable news on a set that\\nlooks like the desktop -- running streams of data framing the main\\npage -- while streaming video on a nearby laptop will probably be\\nwatching just one screen that can do all of those things four years\\nfrom now.\\n\\n\"there was a palpable hunger for information and data about\\nthis election that has nothing to do with media,\" said mark\\njurkowitz, of the project for excellence in journalism. \"nobody\\nreports, you decide.\"\\n\\nmuch of south africa\\'s self-image\\nis built on the iconography of the african national congress: the\\nlong walk to freedom, the devotion to democratic principles, the\\nracially tolerant rainbow nation of nelson mandela. in the three\\nnational elections since the end of apartheid, the anc has won each\\ntime with the overwhelming support of voters.\\n\\nso this weekend\\'s convention led by an anc breakaway faction was\\nsomewhat jarring. dissidents repeatedly described the party they\\nonce loved as now being authoritarian, hypocritical and corrupt.\\nleaders at the convention predicted a stream of defections -- and\\nvictory for their group in elections next year.\\n\\n\"we are starting on the basis that we want to become the next\\ngovernment, in the provinces and nationally,\" mbhazima shilowa,\\none of the main dissidents and the former premier of gauteng\\nprovince, said sunday at a news conference meant to trumpet what\\nthe convention had accomplished.\\n\\nindeed, this weekend may go down in south african history as a\\nwatershed, a time when 6,400 delegates from around the nation\\ncharted a new political course that loosened the anc\\'s grip. then\\nagain, the movement might turn out to be a flop, a lot of batting\\nof wings without any sustained takeoff.\\n\\nthe months ahead will tell the tale. a tug of war is under way\\nfor the loyalty of party members. there are rumors, whispers,\\nguesses. the sunday times, one of the country\\'s leading newspapers,\\nreports that 100 anc members of parliament are preparing to desert\\nthe party. the insurrection is thought to be biggest in the\\nprovinces of eastern cape, western cape and northern cape.\\n\\nshilowa coyly boasted, \"there will be some resignations today,\\nand there will be some tomorrow and some on tuesday going\\nonwards.\"\\n\\nif anc leaders are worried, they manage a brave face in public.\\n\\n\"the wealthy gathered yesterday at their fancy convention\" in\\nthe suburbs, jacob zuma, the party president, derisively remarked\\nsunday at a rally in the township of soweto that drew about 20,000\\npeople. \"there\\'s not much they said.\"\\n\\nhowever much it was, the activities at the convention drew the\\nkind of news coverage ordinarily reserved for extraordinary events,\\nwith banner headlines like \"the fight is on\" and \"hungry for\\nchange.\"\\n\\nnot only were anc dissidents present at the convention, but also\\nthe leaders of most of the nation\\'s small political parties, each\\nallowed to lambaste the anc on the podium as the crowd called out\\n\"bua,\" meaning \"say it.\"\\n\\nthe minister who delivered the invocation said the anc was\\n\"stagnating and rotting.\" patricia de lille, leader of the\\nindependent democrats, said, \"the once proud liberation movement\\nhas lost its way.\" helen zille, head of the democratic alliance --\\nthe opposition party with the second-most seats in parliament --\\nhinted that a broad anti-anc coalition was possible.\\n\\nzuma, speaking in soweto, seized on the notion of the dissidents\\nand their strange bedfellows, four times mentioning the largely\\nwhite democratic alliance. \"even before the divorce has concluded\\nthey have now announced that they will be getting married to the\\ndemocratic alliance and other opposition parties to form a\\ncoalition,\" he said.\\n\\nwearing a pullover shirt and a baseball cap, and speaking mostly\\nin zulu, zuma presented himself as more a man of the people than\\nhis opponents at the sandton convention center, in a well-to-do\\njohannesburg suburb and part of an exclusive shopping mall. trays\\nof cookies sat on pedestals in the lobbies of the convention hall.\\nwaiters poured coffee and tea.\\n\\nshilowa was somewhat evasive about the financing of the event\\nbut said that the cost was at least $500,000 and that an accounting\\nof the finances would be made public.\\n\\nthe breakaway party has been in the works for about a month, set\\noff by the anc\\'s dismissal of one of its own, thabo mbeki, as\\npresident of the country on sept. 20. mbeki has played no visible\\nrole in the breakaway faction, but many of its leaders are close to\\nhim.\\n\\naccording to shilowa, the party will be officially established\\non dec. 16 in bloemfontein, where the anc, africa\\'s oldest\\nliberation movement, was formed in 1912. a name for the new party\\nwill be selected in the next few days, he said. the organization\\nhas tentatively been called the south african national congress,\\nbut the anc has gone to court in an attempt to stop use of a name\\nso similar to its own.\\n\\nprivate equity firms embarked on one of the biggest spending\\nsprees in corporate history for nearly three years, using borrowed\\nmoney to gobble up huge swaths of industries and some of the\\nbiggest names -- neiman marcus, metro-goldwyn-mayer and toys \"r\"\\nus, among them.\\n\\nthe new owners then saddled the companies with the billions of\\ndollars of debt used to buy them. but now many of the loans and\\nbonds sold to finance the deals are about to come due at the worst\\npossible time. like homeowners with an adjustable rate mortgage\\nthat just went up, some of private equity\\'s titans are facing a\\nhuge squeeze. and that is coming at the same time as consumers are\\nstaying home with their wallets closed.\\n\\nalready this year, big retailers backed by private equity, like\\nlinens \\'n things, mervyn\\'s and steve &amp;amp; barry\\'s, have filed for\\nbankruptcy. and analysts expect an even broader array of companies\\nbacked by private equity -- including resorts like harrah\\'s\\nentertainment and lenders like gmac, the financing arm of general\\nmotors -- to face even more pressure as profits shrivel and\\ncreditors come knocking.\\n\\n\"there\\'s absolutely going to a lot of pain to go around,\" said\\njosh lerner, a professor of investment banking at harvard business\\nschool, who wrote a seminal paper on private equity. \"the big\\nquestion is how apocalyptic it will be.\"\\n\\nthe shakeout could have enormous implications for the economy:\\npeople who work for companies owned by private equity firms could\\nlose their jobs as firms cut costs to meet their debt obligations.\\nand private equity firms like apollo management, which owns\\nharrah\\'s and linens \\'n things, face deep markdowns on the value of\\ntheir holdings.\\n\\npension funds and college endowments that invested in these\\nfunds in recent years hoping for big returns are likely to suffer\\nas well, and many of those investors could face a cash squeeze\\nbecause they are probably going to have to hold onto their\\ninvestments for years, until the economy turns around.\\n\\n\"the dangling other shoe is now about to drop,\" said jeffrey\\na. sonnenfeld, senior associate dean of the yale school of\\nmanagement.\\n\\nprivate equity firms, which are lightly regulated, use\\ninvestors\\' money to buy undervalued public companies and take them\\nprivate. when the economy was booming, the firms made huge profits\\nby cutting costs at their new acquisitions, improving operations\\nand then turning around and selling them. in 2007, at the height of\\nthe bubble, such deals totaled $796 billion, or more than 16\\npercent of the $4.83 trillion in all the deals made globally that\\nyear, according to data from dealogic.\\n\\nfirms like blackstone group and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp;amp; co.,\\nwhich faced an image problem at the height of the bubble for\\nexcessive compensation and beneficial tax treatment, but their\\nreturns were so high that even investors like pension funds were\\ndrawn in. now these firms, built on enormous amounts of debt, are\\nbeing forced to go back to the financial markets just as those\\nmarkets have nearly frozen up. if history is any guide, the worst\\nmay be yet to come. steven n. kaplan, a professor at university of\\nchicago graduate school of business, found that nearly 30 percent\\nof all big public-to-private deals made from 1986 to 1989\\ndefaulted. afterward, private equity players were called in front\\nof congress and movies like \"wall street\" and \"other people\\'s\\nmoney\" were made depicting financiers as greedy criminals.\\n\\nto be sure, many companies that were not purchased by private\\nequity firms are also struggling. circuit city, the longtime seller\\nof consumer electronics, is trying to stave off a bankruptcy\\nfiling. and publicly traded automakers like gm are troubled, too.\\n(gm wants to merge with the struggling chrysler, which is owned by\\nprivate equity.)\\n\\nmany industry insiders and analysts contend that private\\nequity-backed companies will not suffer nearly as much as those in\\nthe late 1980s, because the firms pushed for better financing\\nconditions that allow them to keep operating even if they cannot\\nmake their debt payments.\\n\\nfor example, in an effort to save cash, six of apollo\\'s\\nportfolio companies, including claire\\'s stores, harrah\\'s and\\nrealogy, have announced this year that they will pay some of their\\nbonds\\' interest payments by issuing more debt.\\n\\nkaplan said he believed that while \"it isn\\'t going to be\\npretty,\" today\\'s deals \"are much less fragile and used less\\nleverage.\" he contended that \"on a relative basis to investment\\nbanks and hedge funds, private equity may be in a better place\"\\nbecause of its long-term focus.\\n\\nstephen a. schwarzman, chairman of blackstone group, remains\\ncommitted to the future of private equity. \"the people rooting for\\nthe collapse of private equity are going to be disappointed,\" he\\nsaid. while some companies may find themselves in trouble, he said,\\nmany more will be able to ride out a downturn in the economy\\nbecause of the lax financing conditions that banks agreed to at the\\ntop of the market.\\n\\nhe added that he believes that now may be the best time for\\nprivate equity because of the investment opportunities amid the\\ncrisis. \"historically, downturns are when the most money gets\\nmade,\" he said. shares of blackstone are hovering at around $10,\\ndown from the $31 they were at when blackstone went public in june\\n2007. (fortress investment group, another big firm, is trading at\\n$4.90 a share, down from its initial price of $35 in february\\n2007.)\\n\\nlerner, of the harvard business school, said that trouble among\\nprivate equity firms would probably \"precipitate hard questions\\nabout the compensation and fee structure\" in the industry. the\\nfirms generally take fees of 2 percent of all money managed and 20\\npercent of profits. \"i would not be surprised if they try to head\\nof the criticism by returning capital,\" he said.\\n\\nthe problem for recent deals is that many firms waded into\\neconomically sensitive sectors like retailing and restaurants.\\nfirms like apollo, cerberus capital management and sun capital\\npartners purchased several troubled companies to turn around from\\n2004 through the first half of 2007.\\n\\nin the case of linens \\'n things, a longtime also-ran to bed,\\nbath &amp;amp; beyond, apollo knew that it had a tough job ahead of it, yet\\nit still added lots of debt. two months before linens \\'n things was\\nacquired, it reported $2.1 million in long-term debt; by dec. 31,\\n2007, that amount had exploded to $855 million.\\n\\nat the time, private equity firms assumed that they could\\nrefinance their portfolio companies\\' debt cheaply. but many appear\\nto have been blindsided by the size and severity of the credit\\nmarket meltdown, which has left lenders unable or unwilling to loan\\nout more money.\\n\\nin what seems a worrisome trend, many bonds of private\\nequity-backed companies have recently plummeted in value, signaling\\nworries about their solvency. these include michaels, the crafts\\nstore co-owned by bain capital and the blackstone group; dollar\\ngeneral, a low-price retailer taken private by kohlberg kravis\\nroberts; and realogy, the parent company of the real estate\\nbrokerage firms coldwell banker and century 21 that is owned by\\napollo management.\\n\\nthe bonds issued by harrah\\'s entertainment, for example, were\\ntrading at 16.5 cents on the dollar, signaling investors\\' belief\\nthat the company was drawing closer to a potential default.\\nharrah\\'s, too, was saddled with a lot of debt when it was taken\\nprivate. a month before the closing of the harrah\\'s takeover, the\\ncompany reported $12.4 billion in long-term debt. by june 30, that\\nfigure had swollen to $23.9 billion. harrah\\'s has already begun\\nmaking selective staff cuts and has begun scaling back costs, even\\ncutting back hours in its vip lounge and the free \"comps\" for its\\nbest customers.\\n\\n\"unfortunately, the worst-case scenario is now looking like the\\nbase case scenario,\" analysts from creditsights, a research firm,\\nwrote in a research note on oct. 17 about harrah\\'s. \"while the\\ncompany could be able to pull through unscathed, the market is\\ngiving little credit to do so.\"\\n\\nthe vice-presidential candidates spent the\\nfinal, frenetic hours of the 2008 campaign on traditionally\\nrepublican turf, with sen. joseph r. biden jr. urging democrats to\\nget to the polls and gov. sarah palin warning that \"the far-left\\nwing of the democrat\" party is poised to take over washington.\\n\\npalin addressed large crowds in florida, north carolina and\\nvirginia on saturday, and made several appearances in ohio on\\nsunday. biden spent saturday and sunday skittering around ohio and\\nflorida before heading to missouri for an early appearance on\\nmonday.\\n\\nit is no coincidence that the candidates are appearing only in\\nstates that president bush won in 2004. the republican ticket, led\\nby sen. john mccain of arizona, is playing defense while the\\ndemocrats, confident they have locked up the states they won in\\n2004, are seeking new territory.\\n\\npalin\\'s message, at its heart, is a fear-based argument against\\nelecting sen. barack obama of illinois. she warns voters that obama\\nwill raise taxes, expand government, capitulate to terrorists and\\npromote an extreme liberal agenda with the help of broader\\ndemocratic majorities in congress.\\n\\n\"the time for choosing is near, and the choice is going to come\\ndown to what we believe in, ohio,\" palin said at a rally sunday in\\ncanton, ohio. \"we believe in the forward movement of freedom, not\\nthe constant expansion of government.\"\\n\\nbiden\\'s message has evolved in recent days, from harsh attacks\\non mccain and palin to a broader appeal for an end to what he calls\\nthe \"politics of division.\" he still mocks the republican ticket,\\narguing that they are not mavericks but rather mere \"sidekicks\"\\nto bush who would continue his foreign and economic policies. he\\nsays that in their desperation, mccain and palin are using smears\\nand lies to impugn obama\\'s character and patriotism.\\n\\nbut biden, with an unstated sense that victory is within the\\ndemocrats\\' grasp, has turned to a call for healing a divided\\nnation. he urges his audiences to \"choose hope over fear.\"\\n\\n\"we have to unite this country,\" biden said at a rally at\\nflorida state university here on sunday afternoon. \"we cannot stay\\nblue and red, really, we cannot stay divided. we can\\'t strengthen\\nthe economy if we are pitted one against the other.\"\\n\\n\"we cannot move past the politics of division unless we reach\\nout to those people in the parking lot,\" biden added, referring to\\nabout a dozen noisy pro-mccain protesters near the event.\\n\\nin florida on saturday, palin used the age-old tactic of warning\\nelderly people that her opponents were not committed to social\\nsecurity. (biden did the same thing in florida last week.) in\\nvirginia, she affirmed her support for gun owners\\' rights, drawing\\nloud cheers. speaking with a southern twang, she said she would\\nwork on \"keeping virginia red and making y\\'all prosperous.\"\\n\\npalin\\'s crowds have been enormous and enthusiastic, shaking\\nred-and-white pompoms and filling minor league baseball stadiums,\\nairplane hangars and warehouses. the music at campaign events\\nreinforces her image as a plain-spoken, hard-working reformer (\"9\\nto 5\" and \"straight talk\" by dolly parton), while paying tribute\\nto her appearance (\"she\\'s not just a pretty face\" by shania twain\\nand \"isn\\'t she lovely\" by stevie wonder).\\n\\npalin is almost always accompanied by her husband, todd, whom\\nshe chirpily introduces as \"alaska\\'s first dude.\" (sometimes she\\nfollows up by joking that he \"looks like one of those secret\\nservice guys.\")\\n\\nbiden has been joined for the last several days by his wife of\\n31 years, jill jacobs biden, a community college professor. she\\ntells audiences that this is the most important election of their\\nlifetimes and adds a few biographical notes about her husband,\\nincluding that he lost his first wife and a young daughter in a car\\naccident in 1972.\\n\\nwhen biden takes the stage -- unfailingly, to \"the rising\" by\\nbruce springsteen -- he thanks obama for choosing him as his running\\nmate. \"the reason i\\'m so thankful,\" he says, \"is i\\'ve never\\nheard my wife say such nice things about me in public.\"\\n\\nbiden regularly warns against complacency and urges those in the\\naudience who have not voted already to cast their ballots early if\\npossible.\\n\\nbiden and palin have accelerated their schedules, now appearing\\nat as many as five rallies a day in as many cities. a week ago, two\\nor three events a day was the norm for each candidate.\\n\\nthey have shortened their stump speeches and are spending less\\ntime greeting supporters. their exhaustion is beginning to show,\\nparticularly late at night. palin\\'s voice sometimes grows hoarse\\nand biden occasionally stumbles over lines he has repeated dozens\\nof times. the other night he referred to his running mate as\\n\"baracko.\"\\n\\njust as sen. hillary rodham clinton of new york did in the\\nprimaries, palin dismisses obama\\'s oratory as \"just words,\" even\\nas she whips crowds into a frenzy with her own remarks.\\n\\n\"the rousing speeches of our opponent, they can fill a\\nstadium,\" palin said. \"but they cannot keep our country safe. and\\nfor a season, a man can inspire with his words, but for a lifetime,\\njohn mccain has inspired us with his deeds!\"\\n\\nher speeches have relied on repetition, especially words like\\n\"tough\" and \"guts\" when applied to mccain. speaking in virginia\\non saturday night, palin repeated the phrase \"joe the plumber\"\\nsix times.\\n\\npalin singles out biden regularly in her remarks, noting that he\\nonce said it would be patriotic for the wealthy to pay more taxes,\\nand recalling that, in a verbal slip, biden said that he and obama\\nopposed so-called clean coal technology.\\n\\nbut biden rarely singles out anything palin has said or done. he\\ndoes not question her qualifications or mention any of her verbal\\nblunders. she appears, if at all, as \"mccain-palin,\" merely an\\nappendage to the republican nominee for president.\\n\\non monday, palin will begin her day in ohio, and then head to\\nmissouri, iowa, colorado and nevada. late that night, she will fly\\nto anchorage, travel to her home in wasilla, alaska, to cast her\\nvote, and then fly to phoenix to join mccain.\\n\\nbiden will start monday with a speech in lee\\'s summit, mo., then\\nappear in zanesville and akron, ohio, before ending his day with a\\nrally in philadelphia. he will vote in his hometown of wilmington,\\ndel., then fly to chicago to spend election night with obama at a\\nlarge gathering in grant park.\\n\\nsandy hammargren is the definition of a patient,\\nlong-suffering wife, except when it comes to big bertha.\\n\\nher husband, dr. lonnie hammargren, built big bertha, a black\\n10-foot-tall model locomotive, in their backyard from a disparate\\ncollection of parts: a rail car believed to have brought howard\\nhughes to las vegas, part of a road girder, a piece of an 1890\\nsteam tractor, a boiler \"from something entirely different, i\\ncan\\'t remember what,\" hammargren said. the wheels were from\\ncastoff parts of old cat scan machines.\\n\\n\"oh, i just hate it,\" she said. \"it\\'s awful to look at.\"\\n\\nthat she wants big bertha gone is not surprising. what is\\nastonishing is that big bertha is all that earns her wrath when\\nnearly every inch of her vast home is overwhelmed by thousands of\\nother bits of memorabilia, collections, bizarre shop projects and\\nunadulterated junk.\\n\\nthe endless displays, which leave nary an inch of floor space\\ninside or outside their home, in southeast las vegas, add up to a\\nlifetime of acquisitions for hammargren, a former two-term nevada\\nlieutenant governor and retired neurosurgeon.\\n\\nhammargren opened the home to the public on sunday afternoon, as\\nhe does each year to observe the anniversary of nevada statehood.\\nonce a stately one-story house, it has three floors and is attached\\nto homes on each side that hammargren bought over the years and\\nloaded with his ever-multiplying collections.\\n\\nthe contents range wildly and appear to have little\\norganization: a life-size doll of the late entertainer sammy davis\\njr. sits as the conductor of a train that came from the nevada test\\nsite nuclear proving ground. hammargren is predominantly occupied\\nby items from old vegas casinos, scale models of famous sites from\\naround the globe and various nasa space missions. hammargren, 70,\\nwas a nasa flight surgeon who flew in jets with the likes of the\\nastronaut buzz aldrin, a friend and occasional visitor.\\n\\nthe home goes by at least three names -- the castillo del sol,\\nthe hammargren home of nevada history and the principality of\\nparadise. hammargren calls his stead a country of its own and gives\\nvisitors faux gold coins with his face on them.\\n\\ntrying to converse with hammargren is a challenge because, like\\nthe disparate items crammed into his home, his soliloquies move\\nwithout pause or logical transition from one world to another.\\n\\n\"my hobbies are astronomy and archeology, put it together\\nthat\\'s archostronomy, which is really the history of the world\\nthrough stars, but oh, there\\'s the large pink egg that liberace\\nused to come out of every easter during his easter show,\" he said.\\n\"and over there, that\\'s my saddam hussein-osama bin laden display,\\nwhich i call the \\'wacky iraqi half tacky.\"\\'\\n\\nas a political figure, hammargren, a republican, was never taken\\nall that seriously. his quirky persona helped him win election in\\n1990 and 1994 as the state\\'s lieutenant governor, an office with\\nvirtually no duty other than to ascend in the event of the\\ngovernor\\'s death or removal.\\n\\nbut hammargren did not seem to see the office that way. he\\nstartled the political establishment when, as acting governor when\\ngov. bob miller, a democrat, was momentarily out of the state, he\\ntried to appoint someone to fill a vacancy on the lincoln county\\ncommission. the secretary of state, also a republican, refused to\\nnotarize the appointment. hammargren ran for governor in 2000 but\\ndid not earn his party\\'s nomination.\\n\\nhe is well regarded as a physician. when he arrived in nevada in\\n1971, he was one of only two neurosurgeons in the state and has\\noperated on thousands of people since. among his most notable\\npatients was roy horn, of the illusionist duo siegfried &amp;amp; roy, who\\nwas attacked on stage by a tiger in 2003. yet that, too, got\\nhammargren into some trouble when he disclosed to reporters details\\nof the surgery.\\n\\non sunday, as a crowd wended through the home, many took in the\\nscenery with a mixture of bemusement, repulsion and, indeed, a\\nlittle fear.\\n\\n\"oh god, what\\'s going to be in the next room?\" asked darren\\nd\\'amato, 44, of henderson, who decided to visit after hearing a\\nlocal radio host say on friday that the open house was a rite of\\npassage for nevadans. \"this place is a beautiful monstrosity.\\nthat\\'s the only way i can describe it.\"\\n\\nd\\'amato wondered how the neighbors cope. many grouse to the news\\nmedia, anonymously, about the clutter and clatter and about\\nconcerns that such an eyesore damages home values in a subdivision\\nof half-acre lots with neat lawns and tasteful facades. by\\ncontrast, the principality of paradise\\'s facade is a huge, homemade\\nfiberglass replica of a mayan temple.\\n\\nthe hammargrens have skirmished with neighbors who have\\ncomplained to local authorities, but the doctor has never been\\nforced to limit or alter his home. thousands come to see the place\\nwhen it is open for visitors, but it has also topped local\\nnewspaper readers\\' polls as the city\\'s biggest eyesore.\\n\\nyet dotty reeve, who weeded her yard across the street on\\nsaturday, said she enjoyed her proximity.\\n\\n\"it\\'s kind of fun, to tell you the truth,\" reeve said. \"not\\nmany people like it, but it\\'s not

pro-kremlin youth group\\nnashi gathered in front of the united states embassy here on sunday\\nnight carrying jack-o\\'-lanterns inked with the names of war victims\\nand charging that the war in

climbed off buses that had\\ncarried them to moscow from far-flung provincial capitals. they\\nheld the pumpkins aloft for a moment of silence as a deep bass\\nthumped and carnival-style lights played on the embassy\\'s facade.\\n\\nin a film projected on several large screens, an actor playing\\npresident bush (though with a heavy russian accent) delivered a\\nspeech in which he gloated over the united states\\' control over\\nworld affairs. the film asserted that the united states\\norchestrated world wars i and ii so that the american economy could\\novertake europe\\'s, carried out the sept. 11 attacks to broaden\\ngovernment powers and planned to brand every person on the planet\\nwith the \"mark of the beast,\" as referenced in the bible.\\n\\n\"when that will happen, we will totally control all humanity,\"\\nsaid the actor playing bush, swigging a beer, as a picture of the\\nglobe in chains glowed behind him.\\n\\nthe opinions in the crowd were far more nuanced. most of the\\ndemonstrators, men and women in their teens and early 20s, said\\nthey held the united states responsible for the war in georgia,\\nsaying president mikheil saakashvili of georgia would not have\\nattacked the separatist enclave of south ossetia without express\\npermission from american officials.\\n\\nseveral demonstrators said they had become disillusioned with\\nthe united states during the 1990s, saying the reforms it pushed\\nhad led russia into financial and political chaos.\\n\\n\"we don\\'t like to be told how to live, and we don\\'t like it\\nwhen our peacekeepers are attacked,\" said yura yakor, 23. \"you\\'re\\nnot likely to find any fans of america here.\"\\n\\nas they shivered in the wintry rain, nearly everyone had\\nsomething to say about the coming u.s. elections. many agreed with\\nthe theory, espoused by prime minister vladimir v. putin in a\\ntelevised interview this fall, that the war in georgia was planned\\nto increase the chances of mccain, the republican presidential\\ncandidate. a few said they thought a victory for sen. barack obama\\nwould greatly improve relations between the united states and\\nrussia.\\n\\n\"if mccain wins, i think everything will get worse,\" said\\nyekaterina anisimova, 20, who had traveled from vladimir, about 125\\nmiles east of moscow, for the rally. \"he is categorically against\\nrussia. obama is the opposite. all this could end.\"\\n\\nher friend, yana vinogradova, agreed.\\n\\n\"we don\\'t hate america,\" she said. \"we just have a bad\\nrelationship with this administration.\"\\n\\nas the american reporter departed, anisimova yelled after her,\\n\"vote for obama!\"\\n\\ngov. sarah palin of alaska was swiftly working\\nthe rope line friday at an apple orchard in southwestern\\npennsylvania when she met a supporter who brought her to an abrupt\\nstop.\\n\\namber brown, 23, held a poster that read, \"i have down syndrome\\nand i\\'m voting for you. i\\'m a fighter too!\"\\n\\nseeing brown, palin wrapped her in a tight hug.\\n\\n\"i love that poster,\" palin said. \"you\\'re a fighter and\\nyou\\'re beautiful.\"\\n\\nthen palin hugged her again. before climbing back on her\\ncampaign bus, she circled back to brown and hugged her a third\\ntime.\\n\\npalin, the republican vice-presidential nominee, continues to\\nattract enthusiastic crowds wherever she travels, and invariably\\namong her supporters are those drawn by her advocacy for children\\nwith special needs.\\n\\npalin, 44, is herself the mother of a child with down syndrome,\\n6-month-old trig, who frequently travels with her. within minutes\\nafter boarding her campaign plane at the end of a long day, palin\\ncan often be seen leaning over trig, cooing and feeding him from a\\nbottle.\\n\\nhe is usually brought on stage with the rest of the palin\\nfamily, held by willow or piper, two of palin\\'s daughters. on\\nhalloween, trig went trick-or-treating with the palin entourage,\\ndressed as a baby elephant.\\n\\nin the two months since she was named as sen. john mccain\\'s\\nrunning mate, palin has made trig, and children like him, the\\nemotional center of her campaign.\\n\\nand families have turned out at every stop, carrying signs,\\nwearing t-shirts and pressing to the front of the rope lines for a\\nhug or a photo with a candidate many of them see as a potential\\nfirst friend in the white house, someone poised to bring better\\nschooling, more medicaid financing and greater attention to their\\ncause.\\n\\npalin\\'s first policy speech as a vice-presidential nominee\\naddressed school financing for special-needs children. she promised\\nthat under a mccain-palin administration disabled students would\\nhave the option of attending private schools at public expense. as\\ngovernor of alaska, palin increased funding for special-needs\\nstudents, signing a bill that promised to triple per-pupil spending\\nover three years for those students whose educations cost more.\\n\\nbut beyond policy, the families say they see in palin someone\\nwho understands their struggles -- who \"gets it,\" as palin might\\nsay -- and connects with them in a personal way.\\n\\nafter giving that policy address on oct. 24, in a hotel meeting\\nroom before about 150 parents and children with special needs,\\npalin was leaving the room when one of the babies was heard crying.\\n\\n\"don\\'t worry one bit about any crying baby,\" palin said.\\n\"that\\'s the sound of life. i love it, that\\'s good. i say that,\\ntoo, because the next one crying could be my son.\"\\n\\npalin\\'s mention of the subject is the emotional high point of\\nher stump speech, a late moment when she talks about what she would\\ndo as vice president and mentions a \"mission that is especially\\nclose to my heart.\"\\n\\nspeaking to more than 8,000 people last week in jeffersonville,\\nind., palin had just begun to mention children with special needs\\nwhen she was interrupted by a shout, \"we love you, sarah!\"\\n\\nshe continued, saying they \"have been excluded and been made to\\nfeel that there is no place for them in the life of our country.\\nand this attitude is a grave disservice to these beautiful children\\nand to their families and to america. and i\\'m going to work to\\nchange that.\" the crowd erupted in cheers.\\n\\nignoring her teleprompter, palin gazed to her left. \"i\\'ve got\\nto make a comment about this poster,\" she said. \" \\'i\\'m\\nextra-special just like trig.\\' \"\\n\\n\"now what she\\'s saying there,\" palin said, \"that extra\\nchromosome that our blessed bundles of joy were born with. it\\'s\\nlike a bumper sticker that was mailed to me from a down syndrome\\ngroup in arizona. you know how we have bumper stickers on the back\\nof our vehicles saying, you know, my kid\\'s a better soccer player\\nthan your kid, and, my kid\\'s on the honor roll and your kid isn\\'t,\\nwell this bumper sticker says, \\'we win -- my kid has more\\nchromosomes than your kid.\\' \"\\n\\n(begin optional trim.)\\n\\nafterward, anita kearns of louisville, ky., who had watched the\\nspeech with her children -- josh, 27, who has down syndrome, and\\nkatie, 19 -- was beaming. \"she stands for everything that matters\\nright now,\" kearns said. \"free enterprise, the american way,\\nworking for your family.\"\\n\\nbut most important, kearns said, \"i love that she\\'s an advocate\\nfor special needs. it hasn\\'t been since the kennedys that we\\'ve\\nheard a politician talk about it, and they talked about it in a\\nvery different way. and that was so long ago.\"\\n\\nmany of the families who come to palin\\'s events would support\\nthe republican ticket, even if palin did not speak for their\\ninterests. like her, many oppose abortion and share her\\nconservative positions.\\n\\nperry and beth heslop of marietta, ohio, are among them. they\\nattended a rally in ohio on sunday afternoon with their 5-year-old\\nson, tucker, who played quietly on the floor.\\n\\nthey said they were also attracted by palin\\'s position on the\\nsecond amendment and her christian faith. \"and as parents of a\\nspecial-needs child, we admire her for keeping her baby even though\\nshe knew he had down syndrome,\" perry heslop said.\\n\\nheslop said tucker was born without intestines, a condition they\\ndid not know about until he was born.\\n\\ntaking care of him, they said, presents a host of challenges. he\\ncannot eat, so it is difficult to find a qualified caretaker. the\\ncounty government provides a part-time nurse, and their church\\nhelps with gas costs.\\n\\nbut heslop was just notified that his office, the forestry\\ndivision of the ohio department of natural resources, will soon be\\nclosed, and he will lose his health insurance at the end of the\\nyear. without insurance, the cost of tucker\\'s care will be\\noverwhelming. \"we\\'re counting on god to help us,\" heslop said.\\n\\npalin, he said, \"knows the difficulties we\\'re going through.\\njust having someone who knows what\\'s going on. you really have to\\nlive it to understand.\"tracey schmitt, a campaign spokeswoman,\\nsaid several families with special-needs children have kept in\\ntouch with the palins through palin\\'s husband, todd.\\n\\ndavid tolleson, the executive director of the national down\\nsyndrome congress, said the group welcomed the attention palin has\\nbrought.\\n\\n\"anytime a celebrity, if you will, or someone in the national\\nspotlight

in\\nmatching yellow t-shirts from noah\\'s ark, a local support group for\\npeople with developmental disabilities, stood around. among them\\nwere cindy thielemann, 49, of lakeland, fla., and her 23-year-old\\ndaughter, c.j.\\n\\nthielemann said services for her daughter, whom she described as\\ndevelopmentally delayed, have been sharply reduced in recent years.\\n\"there\\'s been so much

stock in his companies after a\\nmargin call from lenders, and there has been fervent speculation\\nthat he could lose his grip on one of the world\\'s great media\\nempires.\\n\\nlike other top executives, he was ensnared by the financial\\ncrisis and the whipsawing stock market, which drove down the price\\nof stock in viacom and cbs to a level that breached his lending\\nagreements with banks -- forcing him to make the big stock sale.\\n\\nbut at least some of redstone\\'s mounting problems can be traced\\nto a 25-year bad bet he made on the video game maker midway games,\\nwhich has cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nredstone has always argued -- not incorrectly -- that video games\\nare part of the media industry\\'s future. but midway, which is best\\nknown for the 1990s arcade game mortal kombat, has eaten up a lot\\nof quarters without much return. midway has not reported a profit\\nsince the second quarter of fiscal 2000, and over the last three\\nfull fiscal years the company has lost $258.9 million.\\n\\nmichael pachter, an analyst at wedbush morgan securities,\\nestimated that redstone has spent $500 million to $700 million on\\nmidway shares since 1983. in late 2005, the company traded at $23 a\\nshare; last week, it closed at about 80 cents.\\n\\nas a result, national amusements -- redstone\\'s holding company --\\nhas been forced to support the company with loans. this year it\\nextended some $90 million to midway to keep it afloat.\\n\\nredstone has publicly insisted that he would not sell more stock\\nin cbs and viacom to cover his personal debts. but he is\\nconsidering selling a financial interest in national amusements,\\nthe family holding company that is redstone\\'s vehicle for\\ncontrolling viacom and cbs, according to an executive briefed on\\nthe matter who spoke anonymously because the negotiations were\\nmeant to be confidential.\\n\\nthis was only the latest installment of the topsy-turvy ride\\nthat has been redstone\\'s life over the last decade -- a span that\\nhas included a messy first divorce, a long and public falling out\\nwith his daughter, a lawsuit over money with his son and the\\ntorpedoing of relationships with his minions and with tom cruise.\\nin the middle of this latest episode, he also filed for divorce\\nfrom his second wife.\\n\\n\"it\\'s typical hollywood soap opera,\" said anthony diclemente,\\na media analyst at barclays capital who covers viacom and cbs.\\n\"it\\'s why you cover this industry.\"\\n\\nbut beyond the personality of redstone himself, who often jokes\\nthat he plans to live forever, the breach in his lending agreements\\nwith the banks illustrates how the opaque structure at his family\\'s\\nholding company left wall street and even company executives in the\\ndark about his financial troubles.\\n\\nnational amusements is a private company with a controlling\\ninterest in cbs and viacom and is governed by a board that includes\\nredstone, his daughter, shari, and three lawyers that have long\\nbeen close to redstone -- including philippe p. dauman, who is also\\nchief executive of viacom. that much has always been clear. what\\ninvestors and analysts did not know was the link between redstone\\'s\\ndebt load and the share prices of cbs and viacom -- and the\\npossibility that a margin call could force a large stock sale.\\n\\non oct. 10, redstone surprised his own executives when he was\\nforced to sell $233 million in nonvoting stock in cbs and viacom\\nbecause he had breached his covenants on $1.6 billion in loans at\\nnational amusements.\\n\\nin a matter of hours, lawyers at cbs and viacom were forced to\\nrelease updated financial guidance, which warned that a\\ndeteriorating advertising market would hit both companies\\' bottom\\nlines. (the updated guidance was to comply with securities laws\\nthat restrict insider stock sales in the weeks before earnings are\\nreleased.)\\n\\nthat redstone had so much debt, and that the debt was tied to\\nthe value of viacom and cbs, was a surprise to analysts, some of\\nwhom raised the question of whether it should have been disclosed\\nearlier.\\n\\ndiclemente, the barclays analyst, said, \"this is the risk you\\ntake when you invest in a company with a big majority shareholder.\\nyou don\\'t know what the personal balance sheets are of these\\nguys.\"\\n\\nthrough a spokesman, redstone declined to be interviewed. but\\nviacom reports earnings on monday, and redstone will join the\\nconference call with wall street analysts.\\n\\nredstone\\'s wealth and identity are linked with cbs and viacom,\\nbut his relationship with midway stretches back further. in 1983 he\\nbegan buying shares in wms industries, midway\\'s predecessor, and\\nhas been a shareholder in the company ever since -- a relationship\\nthat even helped him settle his first divorce, which was filed in\\n1999 and settled in 2002.\\n\\nmidway was spun off from wms industries, a slot machine maker,\\nin 1996 as a separate public company, and sometime after that\\nredstone is said to have decided that video games would become an\\nimportant part of the media business.\\n\\n\"i think that he believed in the industry so much so that any\\ncompany that was solvent that was in the business had potential,\"\\nsaid pachter, who has long followed midway.\\n\\nin late 2005, the stake held by redstone, who owns about 80\\nmillion shares through various entities, or 87 percent of the\\ncompany, was valued at more than $1.8 billion. last week, when\\nshares in midway traded at about 80 cents apiece, his stake had a\\nvalue of just $64 million.\\n\\ndespite this, in march redstone appeared at a media conference\\nin florida hosted by bear stearns and expressed optimism about\\nmidway, saying he \"is committed to midway. we just gave midway $90\\nmillion. we\\'ll do everything to keep it going.\"\\n\\nfor all his billions -- dwindling they now may be -- it was stock\\nin midway that redstone used to pay for his divorce settlement with\\nhis first wife, phyllis, in 2002. after doling out a big chunk of\\nmidway stock, redstone proceeded to replenish his portfolio until\\nlate 2005, when he reached about 80 million shares. his stake is\\nroughly equal to that today. meanwhile, redstone has shuffled the\\nshares in midway among himself, national amusements and a third\\ncompany he created, called sumco. in 2005 he transferred 33 million\\nshares in midway to national amusements, in exchange for national\\nassuming responsibility for a $425 million loan redstone had with\\ncitigroup. as part of this deal, redstone\\'s daughter, shari e.\\nredstone, effectively gained control of the midway stock.\\n\\ntoday shari redstone, who sits on the boards of both viacom and\\ncbs, is also the chairman of midway. redstone and his daughter have\\nengaged in a public feud for more than a year over control of the\\nfamily business. at one point, the two sides were near a deal in\\nwhich shari redstone would trade her stake in cbs and viacom for\\ncomplete ownership of the family\\'s movie theater business, but\\nthose talks have halted because of the present financial troubles\\nat national amusements.\\n\\nat the same time, a committee of two lawyers from boston,\\nredstone\\'s hometown, that have long been by his side, and his\\ndaughter are negotiating with a consortium of banks to restructure\\nsome $1.6 billion in debt at national amusements. as part of those\\ndiscussions, several options for raising cash are under\\nconsideration -- including selling a minority stake in national\\namusements, selling pieces of the family\\'s movie theater chain\\nbusiness or selling stakes in wms industries and midway.\\n\\nmeanwhile shares in both cbs and viacom have tumbled. both have\\nsuffered from the general malaise in the stock market and\\nfundamental shifts in the media industry. last week, cbs reported a\\n$12.6 billion quarterly loss, mainly because of a $14.12 billion\\nwrite-down of certain assets.\\n\\nredstone remains optimistic, however. he once mostly lived out\\nof fancy hotels but now spends much of his time in his gated\\nmansion in beverly park, calif., surrounded by tanks of exotic fish\\nand tended to by his butler. it was from this perch that he joined\\na conference call last week to discuss cbs\\'s quarterly earnings and\\nsaid he did not plan to sell any more shares in cbs or viacom.\\n\\n\"let me make it sure, clear, certain,\" redstone said. national\\namusements \"has no intention of selling a single share of viacom\\nor cbs. now there may be uncertainties all around us, but one of\\nthe things i remain absolutely certain of, whatever actions are\\nrequired, in no way diminishes my optimism of our cbs and viacom.\"\\n\\nmillions of voters will encounter an unfamiliar low-tech\\nlandscape at the polls on tuesday. about half of all voters will\\nvote in a way that is different from what they did in the last\\npresidential election, and most will use paper ballots rather than\\nthe touch-screen machines that have caused concern among voting\\nexperts.\\n\\nbut the change does not guarantee a smooth election day, as the\\nnation\\'s voting system remains untested for what is expected to be\\nan unprecedented turnout. six years after the largest federal\\noverhaul in how elections are run, voting experts are still\\npredicting machine and ballot shortages in several swing states and\\nlate tallies on election night.\\n\\ntwo-thirds of voters will mark their choice with a pencil on a\\npaper ballot that is counted by an optical scanning machine, a\\nmethod considered far more reliable and verifiable than touch\\nscreens. but paper ballots bring their own potential problems,\\nvoting experts say.\\n\\nthe scanners can break down, leading to delays and confusion for\\npoll workers and voters. and the paper ballots of about a third of\\nall voters will be counted not at the polling place but later at a\\ncentral county location. that means that if a voter has made an\\nerror -- not filling in an oval properly, for example, a mistake\\noften made by the kind of novice voters who will be flocking to the\\npolls -- it will not be caught until it is too late. as a result,\\nthose ballots will be disqualified.\\n\\nvoting rights groups have also filed lawsuits against election\\nofficials in pennsylvania and virginia, saying they have not\\nstocked enough paper ballots to prepare for the expected turnout.\\n\\nmost voting experts are not predicting a repeat of the florida\\nmeltdown of 2000, but they are warning that shortages of electronic\\nvoting machines or printed ballots in swing states, along with\\nproblems verifying the identity of voters, could worsen lines and\\nfray nerves.\\n\\n\"what has traditionally happened in this country is that a\\nchange in voting equipment happens once in the lifetime of an\\nelection official,\" said kimball w. brace, president of election\\ndata services, a voting research firm. \"this time, nearly 60\\npercent of the country will vote in places that in the last eight\\nyears have changed their voting equipment.\"\\n\\nthe vice-presidential candidates spent the\\nfinal, frenetic hours of the 2008 campaign on traditionally\\nrepublican turf, with sen. joseph r. biden jr. urging democrats to\\nget to the polls and gov. sarah palin warning that \"the far-left\\nwing of the democrat\" party is poised to take over washington.\\n\\npalin addressed large crowds in florida, north carolina and\\nvirginia on saturday, and made several appearances in ohio on\\nsunday. biden spent saturday and sunday skittering around ohio and\\nflorida before heading to missouri for an early appearance on\\nmonday.\\n\\nit is no coincidence that the candidates are appearing only in\\nstates that president bush won in 2004.\\n\\npalin\\'s message, at its heart, is a fear-based argument against\\nelecting sen. barack obama of illinois. she warns voters that obama\\nwill raise taxes, expand government, capitulate to terrorists and\\npromote an extreme liberal agenda with the help of broader\\ndemocratic majorities in congress.\\n\\n\"the time for choosing is near, and the choice is going to come\\ndown to what we believe in, ohio,\" palin said at a rally sunday in\\ncanton, ohio. \"we believe in the forward movement of freedom, not\\nthe constant expansion of government.\"\\n\\nbiden\\'s message has evolved in recent days, from harsh attacks\\non mccain and palin to a broader appeal for an end to what he calls\\nthe \"politics of division.\" he still mocks the republican ticket,\\narguing that they are not mavericks but rather mere \"sidekicks\"\\nto bush who would continue his foreign and economic policies. he\\nsays that in their desperation, mccain and palin are using smears\\nand lies to impugn obama\\'s character and patriotism.\\n\\nbut biden, with an unstated sense that victory is within the\\ndemocrats\\' grasp, has turned to a call for healing a divided\\nnation. he urges his audiences to \"choose hope over fear.\"\\n\\nbiden and palin have accelerated their schedules, now appearing\\nat as many as five rallies a day in as many cities. their\\nexhaustion is beginning to show, particularly late at night.\\npalin\\'s voice sometimes grows hoarse and biden occasionally\\nstumbles over lines he has repeated dozens of times.\\n\\non monday, palin will begin her day in ohio, and then head to\\nmissouri, iowa, colorado and nevada. late that night, she will fly\\nto anchorage, travel to her home in wasilla, alaska, to cast her\\nvote, and then fly to phoenix to join mccain.\\n\\nbiden will start monday with a speech in lee\\'s summit, mo., then\\nappear in zanesville and akron, ohio, before ending his day with a\\nrally in philadelphia. he will vote in his hometown of wilmington,\\ndel., then fly to chicago to spend election night with obama at a\\nlarge gathering in grant park.\\n\\nwhen did cbs, the network awash in cop shows featuring leading\\nmen in their 50s, become the hot network with young audiences?\\n\\nthis is how topsy-turvy the fall television season has become:\\nfive weeks in, cbs has twice as many shows in the top 20 ranking\\namong young adult viewers as any of its network competitors.\\n\\ncbs is supposed to be the network that does not fixate on the\\n18- to 49-year-old demographic, which many advertisers pay a\\npremium to reach. but the network has been beating abc, nbc and\\nfox, in that ratings competition every week this fall.\\n\\nof course, cbs has also been winning in the somewhat older\\ngroup, 25-to-54-year olds, just as it has been attracting the most\\nviewers over all.\\n\\nthis has not occurred since the antediluvian days before the\\ninstallation of so-called people meter ratings system in 1987.\\n\\nthe secret, at least as the chairman of cbs, leslie moonves,\\nsees it: \"comfort food.\"\\n\\nwhile other networks sit and watch their glossy serial dramas\\nfeaturing expensive casts crash, cbs has added yet another\\nsuccessful crime show, \"the mentalist.\" it has also added a\\ncouple more \"funny comedies that probably won\\'t win any emmy\\nawards\" as moonves described them: \"gary unmarried\" and \"worst\\nweek.\"\\n\\napparently, what is good for cbs is a bad economy. cbs\\'s lineup\\nof police procedurals, where the criminals always get caught, and\\nsitcoms that are reliably funny in unchallenging ways, seems to be\\nbecoming a safe haven for viewers worried about jobs and mortgages.\\n\\n\"when the road gets rocky, the center is the best place to\\nbe,\" said kelly kahl, the chief scheduler for cbs. \"it\\'s kind of\\na cliche,\" moonves said, \"on cbs the good guys win.\" or as kahl\\nput it, \"we give people what they want.\"\\n\\nthe news is not all kind to cbs. many executives are concerned\\nthat the advertising market will freeze up because of the economy.\\nlast week, cbs was forced to take a write-down of $14 billion\\nbecause the advertising market for its local television, radio and\\noutdoor businesses is so bad.\\n\\n\"we have a lot of advertising and people are down on\\nadvertising right now,\" moonves said.\\n\\nand it is not as if cbs has found a magic potion; its move to\\nfirst place is mostly attributable to standing still while others\\nslide down. cbs is not actually up in the ratings. it is down,\\nmarginally, about 3 percent. but its competitors are down near 15\\npercent each.\\n\\nall of these measures are based on the traditional ratings\\nsystem. that ratings system itself is in the midst of upheaval\\nbecause of the increasing use of digital video recorders, which\\nallow for delayed viewing, and the shift by advertisers toward\\nbuying shows on how well their commercials are rated after three\\ndays of viewing -- the so-called c3 measurement.\\n\\nabc, which has taken serious hits almost across the board in\\nterms of traditional program ratings, points to those c3 ratings as\\nsome solace.\\n\\n\"by the most important yardstick, based on the sales currency\\nof c3 ratings, we\\'re the network leader,\" stephen mcpherson, the\\npresident of abc entertainment, said in an e-mail message.\\n\\nthat may prove helpful if abc can keep it up. the c3 numbers are\\nso far available only through two weeks.\\n\\nnetwork executives point to a raft of reasons why this season\\nhas been so rocky, starting with last season\\'s writers strike. but\\nother factors have intruded this fall.\\n\\n\"the economy and the election are the two most important shows\\nin america right now,\" said ben silverman, the co-chairman of nbc\\nentertainment. the faltering economy is threatening the advertising\\nthat pays for most television shows.\\n\\nthe election has proved a powerful attraction, silverman said.\\n\"people aren\\'t watching network shows as much, but the cable news\\nnetworks are setting records,\" he said. and he said that the four\\ndebates this fall, coming on separate nights of the week, disrupted\\nevery network\\'s schedule.\\n\\nthe most important move cbs made, moonves said, was to get the\\nnetwork\\'s series back on the air last spring after the strike\\nended, while other networks let shows lapse in production.\\n\\nboth abc and nbc had a group of first-year shows that were\\ntruncated by the strike. abc\\'s entire wednesday night schedule\\nconsisted of first-year shows that it suspended after the strike\\nand then brought back this fall. the ratings have plummeted for\\nthose shows: \"pushing daisies,\" \"dirty sexy money\" and\\n\"private practice.\"\\n\\nother serialized shows, like the nbc drama \"heroes\" and even\\nabc\\'s biggest hits, \"grey\\'s anatomy\" and \"desperate\\nhousewives,\" have performed well below their levels of a year ago.\\n\\nthat has led to some speculation that the networks may move away\\nfrom serialized shows in the dvr era, both because viewers may\\nincreasingly store episodes of serialized shows to watch them in\\n8-to-10 episode bursts, and because the shows have no repeat value\\nat all.\\n\\nat least one network other than cbs is starting to conclude the\\nsame thing about program trends. \"this fall, we\\'re trying to build\\na spine of shows we can rely on,\" said kevin reilly, the president\\nof fox entertainment. among them: the emerging hit \"bones,\" a\\ncrime drama that solves its cases every week and repeats relatively\\nwell.\\n\\nwhile its fall numbers are down, no one doubts fox\\'s overall\\nstrength, not with \"american idol\" ready to come back, along with\\nthe drama \"24.\" reilly may be putting some extra fear in his\\nrivals by floating the idea that fox may do something different\\nwith \"idol\" this time around -- as in move one of two weekly\\neditions to a regular slot on thursday nights, the most lucrative\\nnight for advertising.\\n\\nthat\\'s where the other three networks have arrayed many of their\\nbiggest shows, and \"idol\" has not ventured there before. now,\\nreilly said, \"we\\'ll certainly explore it.\"\\n\\nmeanwhile, fox\\'s biggest hit drama, \"house,\" has been at the\\ncenter of one of the better strategic moves of the season. fox slid\\nthe show to 8 p.m. from 9 p.m. on tuesdays this fall, knowing, as\\nreilly put it \"that we would take a haircut in ratings\" for\\n\"house\" because viewing levels are lower at 8 p.m. the move,\\nintended to feed a big audience into the new drama \"fringe,\" has\\npaid off. the show is the second true success story of the fall,\\nalong with \"the mentalist.\"\\n\\nsilverman and nbc made another big strategic move in slotting\\nthree weeks of special election-based \"saturday night live\"\\neditions at 9:30 thursdays after the hit comedy \"the office.\" the\\nplan was to prepare the time period for the low-rated but promising\\ncomedy, \"30 rock.\"\\n\\nthe network got a big break with tina fey\\'s celebrated\\nimpersonation of the republican vice presidential candidate, sarah\\npalin, on the \"snl\" specials. the following she built finally\\nseemed to carry over into the strongest ratings ever for the \"30\\nrock\" premiere last thursday.\\n\\nthe urgent need to rebuild comedy -- which has been in reverse\\nfor most of this decade -- may be the most significant message of\\nthe early season.\\n\\nsilverman said he intended to use a \"strategy of patience\"\\nwith nbc\\'s new comedy \"kath and kim,\" which some critics and\\nrivals have already written off. its ratings are hardly special,\\nbut they have stabilized, silverman said. \"we\\'ve got great actors\\nand not-great writing. let\\'s fix it,\" he said.\\n\\nfor the last eight months, adam aigner-treworgy\\'s belongings\\nhave been stowed in the back seat of his silver volvo station\\nwagon.\\n\\nwhen aigner-treworgy, a 24-year-old reporter for nbc news and\\nnational journal, was assigned to cover sen. john mccain\\'s campaign\\nin january, his sister packed up his apartment in washington, d.c.\\n\\n\"i sold as much furniture as i could on craigslist,\" he said,\\nthen parked his car at the nbc bureau and flew to florida to catch\\nup with the mccain campaign. on a rare free day in the spring, he\\ndrove the car, then lacking air-conditioning and a working gas\\ngauge, to his mother\\'s garage in boston, where it remains.\\n\\nthis month, he will resume an ordinary life -- and that means\\nfinding a job in an economy that is gloomy across the board but\\nespecially so for journalists.\\n\\n\"the field of journalism is changing dramatically, so there\\'s\\ndefinitely some trepidation about whether companies will be\\nhiring,\" he said by phone on friday.\\n\\nas politicians enter the presidential primary fray, television\\nnetworks assign staff members -- variously called \"campaign\\nembeds\" or \"off-air reporters\" -- to shadow them, video camera in\\nhand and laptop in backpack. after each campaign event, the embeds\\ndutifully send summaries to their news divisions, flagging any\\nnews-making nuggets. the dispatches are often posted online and\\nused to produce newscasts; the \"from the road\" blog on\\ncbsnews.com counted 9 posts from campaign producers on thursday and\\n10 on friday.\\n\\nas financially struggling newspapers cut back on their coverage\\nfrom the campaign trail, the tv embeds and their counterparts from\\nnational newspapers have become the primary witnesses to the\\ncampaigns of mccain and his democratic opponent, sen. barack obama.\\n\\nand while the experience is invaluable, the opportunities are\\nfew after the election.\\n\\n\"for so long, this has been in the distance. now it\\'s real, now\\nit\\'s here,\" said alexander marquardt, a cnn producer following\\nsen. joseph r. biden jr.\\n\\nthere is a certain nobility, subtle as it may be, to chronicling\\nthe statements of the candidates as they roam the country. \"you\\nbecome the central repository for information about a candidate for\\na big news network,\" aigner-treworgy said.\\n\\nsunlen miller, an abc reporter assigned to obama\\'s campaign,\\nanswers practical questions from the network\\'s correspondents, like\\n\"how many times has obama been to florida in the general\\nelection?\"\\n\\nmike memoli, who shadowed bill clinton for nbc last winter, said\\nhe was sometimes the only tv reporter with him. \"there were no\\nother cameras, no correspondents, so i would film him at each\\nevent,\" he said.\\n\\nfor some embeds, like the cbs producer maria gavrilovic, the\\nassignment has lasted much longer than anticipated. she was\\nassigned to obama \"by chance\" more than a year ago, she said,\\n\"and expected the stint to be short-lived.\"\\n\\ngavrilovic worked on the foreign desk for cbs news before the\\ncampaign, and she expects to return there after the election. abc\\nand the fox news channel also lent staff members from other\\ndepartments.\\n\\nbut others are not as lucky. cnn and nbc relied on a mix of\\nnewly hired employees and existing political producers.\\n\\nthe contracts for the nbc journalists who were hired in\\nconjunction with national journal to follow the candidates expire\\non nov. 14. given the economic downturn, the election is ending at\\na particularly inopportune time for them.\\n\\nmatthew berger, a 30-year-old nbc reporter with gov. sarah palin\\nof alaska, is taking his mother\\'s advice not to think too hard\\nabout his postelection plans. \"she told me not to ruin the last\\ncouple of weeks of a great experience by worrying too much about\\nthe future,\" he said. \"so i\\'ll worry about afterwards,\\nafterwards.\"\\n\\nmarquardt will celebrate his first anniversary at cnn three days\\nafter the election. but as a freelancer, he does not know whether\\nhe will be able to stay with the network. \"so much money has been\\nspent on this campaign, and the economy\\'s in the tank, so there\\'s\\nnot that many positions out there,\" he said, although he remains\\nhopeful.\\n\\nalthough aigner-treworgy does not know what he will be doing in\\ntwo weeks, he has started looking for a new apartment in\\nwashington. he is looking forward to being in the same place for\\nmore than an hour. \"we\\'re on a bus in iowa -- i mean ohio,\"\\naigner-treworgy said friday afternoon. \"i used to know where i\\nwas,\" he added sheepishly.\\n\\nsurely, some embeds will be on a beach soon. memoli talked\\nexcitedly about airline points and hotel points. \"i\\'m figuring out\\nwhere my vacation will be when all this ends,\" he said.\\n\\nprime minister

(the data does not include sales\\nin wal-mart and club stores like costco.)\\n\\nnevertheless, some of the manufacturers are hoping for the best.\\n\"in past recessions, consumer electronics has fared rather well,\"\\nsaid glasgow of sony. \"i believe we\\'ll sell more tvs than last\\nyear.\"\\n\\nbob perry, panasonic\\'s senior vice president for marketing,\\nconcurred. \"we\\'ve been through wars and national calamities,\" he\\nsaid. \"i just don\\'t see sales dropping off.\"\\n\\nanalysts are not so sanguine. \"the anecdotal evidence is that\\nthe stores are pretty quiet,\" semenza said. \"there is a whisper\\nin the industry that the retailers are ordering fewer units.\"\\n\\nthe sets that do sell will probably be smaller. while tv\\nmanufacturers speak of lcd and plasma tvs in the 42-inch range as\\ntheir \"sweet spot,\" for many consumers a tv that big may remain\\nonly a wish. the most popular tvs are in the 30-inch to 34-inch\\nrange. they account for about 26 percent of all sales. tv screens\\nfrom 40 and 44 inches represent 20 percent of unit sales.\\n\\n\"the momentum was heading toward the 42-inch size, but now\\nthat\\'s off track. that size is the aspirational sweet spot,\"\\nsemenza said.\\n\\nmany retailers are cutting costs because they expect a lighter\\nselling season. best buy announced that it would hire 16,000 to\\n20,000 seasonal employees, a hefty drop from last year\\'s 26,000\\nseasonal hires.\\n\\nbest buy\\'s comparable-store sales in september dropped 2 percent\\nfrom the year before. \"we\\'ll see less traffic,\" brian dunn, best\\nbuy\\'s president, said. \"we\\'ll grow our share by offering the right\\nsolution, product and service. we\\'re not looking to get every dime\\nout of you. if a customer just wants the lowest price on a tv set,\\nwe\\'ll give it to them with a smile.\"\\n\\nand to increase the likelihood that customers will pull out\\ntheir wallets, several manufacturers, including panasonic and\\nsharp, are working with retailers to offer extended financing with\\neither same-as-cash interest or deferred payment plans.\\n\\nsome believe that bundling items, like a flat-screen tv with a\\nblu-ray player or an audio system, will provide that extra value\\nthat will push consumers to buy.\\n\\nbest buy will offer a bundle \"targeted to middle america,\"\\ndunn said. and panasonic will offer bundles that use its\\nproprietary viera link technology that allows all panasonic\\ncomponents to work with one remote, encouraging consumers to stay\\nwith the brand.\\n\\nbut not everyone believes in bundling. \"putting a bundle out is\\nabsolutely the wrong thing to do,\" said baker of npd. \"it raises\\nthe absolute price.\"\\n\\nto bolster sales, manufacturers like sharp and sony have\\nintroduced lower-price lines for big-box stores. this spring, sony\\nbegan marketing its m line of tvs through costco, target and\\nwal-mart. sharp\\'s lower cost line, stripped of its aquos brand, is\\nmarketed to mass merchants.\\n\\nsamsung, which sells the most flat-panel tvs in the united\\nstates, sees consumers deserting the midprice segment. \"we may see\\nsome shifting toward entry-level and step-up models,\" said jonas\\ntanenbaum, vice president for lcd television marketing at samsung\\nelectronics america. \"it\\'s the middle area that may not do as\\nwell.\"\\n\\nto capture those with more limited budgets, sony this year is\\nselling lcd tvs in the 19-, 26- and 32-inch sizes. \"there are\\nhundreds of dollars of difference in price between these and\\nstep-up models,\" glasgow said.\\n\\none other hope of the manufacturers and retailers: the\\nconversion this february to a digital broadcast signal that makes\\nmost old tube tvs hooked to an antenna obsolete. consumers can buy\\ndigital-to-analog converter boxes, but the industry is hoping many\\nwill use the conversion as the excuse to buy a new tv.\\n\\nsharp\\'s 32-inch set -- at about $600, its best-selling size -- is\\nappealing to consumers looking to replace a 27-inch tube set, said\\nbob scaglione, senior vice president of the sharp electronics\\nmarketing company of america.\\n\\n\"consumers usually buy based on a set dollar amount,\"\\nscaglione said. \"however, we believe they may concentrate on\\nslightly smaller screen sizes this holiday season. the majority\\nwill try to hang on to 32- and 42-inch sets.\"\\n\\ngov. sarah palin of alaska attracts\\nenthusiastic crowds wherever she travels, and invariably among her\\nsupporters are those drawn by

since she was named as sen. john mccain\\'s\\nrunning mate, palin has made trig, and children like him, the\\nemotional center of her campaign.\\n\\nand families have turned out at every stop,

to bring better\\nschooling, more medicaid financing and greater attention to their\\ncause.\\n\\npalin\\'s first policy speech as a vice-presidential nominee, on\\noct. 24, addressed school financing for special-needs children. she\\npromised that under a mccain-palin administration disabled students\\nwould have the option of attending private schools at public\\nexpense. as governor of alaska, palin increased funding for\\nspecial-needs students, signing a bill that promised to triple\\nper-pupil spending over three years for those students whose\\neducations cost more.\\n\\nbut beyond

near\\nmonopoly on sometimes salacious gossip and mocking satire about\\npoliticians, business figures and journalists. last week, the\\nmagazine, which once took unvarnished delight in the failings of\\nothers, stopped publishing.\\n\\nthe reason: insider gossip of varying reliability and tart\\nopinions, its two mainstays, are now both widely available on the\\ninternet, not just on individuals\\' blogs but on the web sites of\\nthe mainstream newspapers and broadcasters that were once frank\\'s\\nprime targets.\\n\\nwith circulation, which had peaked at 16,000 copies, down to\\nabout 5,000 copies, michael d. bate, the editor and publisher, said\\nhe and his investors concluded that there was no future for frank,\\na biweekly that was never particularly profitable.\\n\\n\"it was always a shoestring operation,\" said bate, a former\\nmusician, software developer and reporter with the canadian press\\nnews service. \"when it was really successful, we had a ton of\\nlawsuits. when it wasn\\'t so successful, we had lots of creditors.\"\\n\\nin its style, design and tone, frank closely resembled the\\nbritish magazine private eye. both rejected glossy paper in favor\\nof cheap newsprint and added cartoon bubbles to photos, frequently\\nof politicians, to create their covers.\\n\\nwhile the magazine was despised and read, often in equal\\nmeasures, by many canadian journalists, frank also broke news that\\nlater received prominent coverage by other news organizations. to\\nbate, frank\\'s biggest contribution was ending what he called a\\n\"gentlemen\\'s club\" among political journalists in canada. it was,\\nhe said, an informal alliance that traded in embarrassing personal\\nstories about politicians while guarding them from publication.\\n\\nfor its regular targets, frank used insider nicknames. conrad m.\\nblack, the former canadian publisher now in a florida prison, for\\nexample, was \"lord tubby.\" and while bate said that the magazine\\ntried to focus only on prominent or influential people, he\\nacknowledged that \"innocent bystanders, nobodies\" were sometimes\\nunfairly made the subject of articles. \"but that\\'s the business we\\nwere in: going too far.\"\\n\\nbecause it is comparatively difficult for publishers to defend\\nlibel lawsuits in canada, they were a constant drain on frank.\\nwhich is not to say frank was always innocent. a judge from quebec\\nsuccessfully sued frank for writing that he had hired a prostitute.\\nat the time the episode was supposed to have taken place, the judge\\nwas in israel with his church choir.\\n\\nfrank frequently pushed the boundaries of good taste. late in\\nhis tenure as prime minister, brian mulroney, a conservative,\\nattended a number of prominent events with his attractive young\\ndaughter rather than his wife, mila. frank responded with a mock\\ncontest open to young conservative party members that offered a\\nsexual encounter with the prime minister\\'s daughter as its grand\\nprize. mulroney later told a television interviewer that contest\\nhad made him want to acquire a gun \"to do serious damage to these\\npeople.\"\\n\\nalthough mulroney left politics in 1993, bate is nostalgic about\\nhis tenure.\\n\\n\"i find canadian politics now so dull, beyond belief dull,\" he\\nsaid. \"they\\'re a bunch

began falling apart. in 2002, kozlowski resigned. both\\nskilling and kozlowski are now convicted felons.\\n\\nbut melville said he was confident his list of best bankers was\\nsolid. \"you wouldn\\'t

post\\n\\nmaybe the polls are wrong, and john mccain is about to pull off\\nthe biggest election upset in american history. but right now the\\ndemocrats seem poised both to win the white house and to greatly\\nexpand their majorities in both houses of congress.\\n\\nmost of the post-election discussion will presumably be about\\nwhat the democrats should and will do with their mandate. but let\\nme ask a different question that will also be important for the\\nnation\\'s future: what will defeat do to the republicans?\\n\\nyou might think, perhaps hope, that republicans will engage in\\nsome soul-searching, that they\\'ll ask themselves whether and how\\nthey lost touch with the national mainstream. but my prediction is\\nthat this won\\'t happen any time soon.\\n\\ninstead, the republican rump, the party that\\'s left after the\\nelection, will be the party that attends sarah palin\\'s rallies,\\nwhere crowds chant \"vote mccain, not hussein!\" it will be the\\nparty of saxby chambliss, the senator from georgia, who, observing\\nlarge-scale early voting by african-americans, warns his supporters\\nthat \"the other folks are voting.\" it will be the party that\\nharbors menacing fantasies about barack obama\\'s marxist -- or was\\nthat islamic? -- roots.\\n\\nwhy will the gop become more, not less, extreme? for one thing,\\nprojections suggest that this election will drive many of the\\nremaining republican moderates out of congress, while leaving the\\nhard right in place.\\n\\nfor example, larry sabato, the election forecaster, predicts\\nthat seven senate seats currently held by republicans will go\\ndemocratic on tuesday. according to the liberal-conservative\\nrankings of the political scientists keith poole and howard\\nrosenthal, five of the soon-to-be-gone senators are more moderate\\nthan the median republican senator -- so the rump, the gop caucus\\nthat remains, will have shifted further to the right. the same\\nthing seems set to happen in the house.\\n\\nalso, the republican base already seems to be gearing up to\\nregard defeat not as a verdict on conservative policies, but as the\\nresult of an evil conspiracy. a recent democracy corps poll found\\nthat republicans, by a margin of more than two to one, believe that\\nmccain is losing \"because the mainstream media is biased\" rather\\nthan \"because americans are tired of george bush.\"\\n\\nand mccain has laid the groundwork for feverish claims that the\\nelection was stolen, declaring that the community activist group\\nacorn -- which, as factcheck.org points out, has never \"been found\\nguilty of, or even charged with\" causing fraudulent votes to be\\ncast -- \"is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the\\ngreatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying\\nthe fabric of democracy.\" needless to say, the potential voters\\nacorn tries to register are disproportionately \"other folks,\" as\\nchambliss might put it.\\n\\nanyway, the republican base, egged on by the mccain-palin\\ncampaign, thinks that elections should reflect the views of \"real\\namericans\" -- and most of the people reading this column probably\\ndon\\'t qualify.\\n\\nthus, in the face of polls suggesting that obama will win\\nvirginia, a top mccain aide declared that the \"real virginia\" --\\nthe southern part of the state, excluding the washington, d.c.,\\nsuburbs -- favors mccain. a majority of americans now live in big\\nmetropolitan areas, but while visiting a small town in north\\ncarolina, palin described it as \"what i call the real america,\"\\none of the \"pro-america\" parts of the nation. the real america,\\nit seems, is small-town, mainly southern and, above all, white.\\n\\ni\\'m not saying that the gop is about to become irrelevant.\\nrepublicans will still be in a position to block some democratic\\ninitiatives, especially if the democrats fail to achieve a\\nfilibuster-proof majority in the senate.\\n\\nand that blocking ability will ensure that the gop continues to\\nreceive plenty of corporate dollars: this year the u.s. chamber of\\ncongress has poured money into the campaigns of senate republicans\\nlike minnesota\\'s norm coleman, precisely in the hope of denying\\ndemocrats a majority large enough to pass pro-labor legislation.\\n\\nbut the gop\\'s long transformation into the party of the\\nunreasonable right, a haven for racists and reactionaries, seems\\nlikely to accelerate as a result of the impending defeat.\\n\\nthis will pose a dilemma for moderate conservatives. many of\\nthem spent the bush years in denial, closing their eyes to the\\nadministration\\'s dishonesty and contempt for the rule of law. some\\nof them have tried to maintain that denial through this year\\'s\\nelection season, even as the mccain-palin campaign\\'s tactics have\\ngrown ever uglier. but one of these days they\\'re going to have to\\nrealize that the gop has become the party of intolerance.\\n\\nbarack obama will probably win the 2008 presidential election.\\nif he does, we conservatives will greet the news with our usual\\nresolute stoicism or cheerful fatalism. being conservative means\\nnever being too surprised by disappointment.\\n\\nbut what if john mccain pulls off an upset?\\n\\ni\\'m worried about my compatriots on the left. michael powell\\nreports in saturday\\'s new york times that even the possibility of\\nan obama defeat has driven many liberals into in a state of high\\nanxiety. and then there\\'s a young woman from denver who \"told her\\nboyfriend that their love life was on hold while she sweated out\\nmr. obama\\'s performance in colorado.\" well, what if obama loses\\ncolorado? or the presidency? as a compassionate conservative, i\\'m\\nconcerned about the well-being of that boyfriend -- and of others\\nwho might be similarly situated. i feel an obligation to help.\\n\\nso let me tell liberals why they should be cheerful if mccain\\nhappens to win.\\n\\n1. it would be a victory for an underdog. liberals are supposed\\nto like underdogs. mccain is a lonely guy standing up against an\\nunprecedentedly well-financed, superorganized, exxonmobil-like\\nobama juggernaut. a mccain upset victory would be a classic liberal\\nhappy ending.\\n\\n2. it would be a defeat for the establishment. obama\\'s most\\nrecent high-profile republican endorser was d.c. insider kenneth\\nduberstein. liberals should be on the side of hard-working\\nplumbers, not big-shot lobbyists -- oops, sorry, big-shot strategic\\nadvisers and consultants. and duberstein said that colin powell\\'s\\nendorsement was \"the good housekeeping seal of approval on barack\\nobama.\" doesn\\'t that comment embody everything that liberals (and\\nmany conservatives, including me) find creepy about smug\\nestablishment back-scratching and gatekeeping in america?\\n\\n3. it would be a victory for the future. with president bush\\'s\\napproval rating at about 25 percent, a mccain triumph would mean\\namericans were making a judgment on two future alternatives, not\\nmerely voting on the basis of their resentment at the past\\nperformance of george w. bush. it would mean voters were looking\\nahead, not back. liberals should therefore welcome a mccain win as\\na triumph of hope over fear, of the future over the past.\\n\\n4. it would be a victory for freedom. obama supporter leon\\nwieseltier of the new republic writes that \"tyrants and\\ngenocidaires would sleep less soundly during a mccain presidency.\"\\nliberals should be opposed to tyranny and genocide. wieseltier also\\nacknowledges that mccain \"was splendidly right about the surge,\\nwhich is not a small thing; and the grudging way obama treats the\\nreversal in iraq, when he treats it at all, is disgraceful.\" the\\nsurge advanced not only our national security but the cause of\\nfreedom in the world. liberals should be votaries of freedom.\\n\\n5. a mccain victory would be good for liberalism. look at recent\\nhistory. jimmy carter and a democratic congress begat ronald\\nreagan. bill clinton and a democratic congress produced newt\\ngingrich. who knows what would follow a president obama and a\\ndemocratic congress? here\\'s one possibility: president sarah palin.\\n\\nso liberals shouldn\\'t be too upset at the idea of mccain\\nwinning. could it happen?\\n\\nit\\'s possible. what if the polls, for various reasons, are\\noverstating obama\\'s support by a couple points? and what if the\\nlate deciders break overwhelmingly against obama, as they did in\\nthe democratic primaries? mccain could then thread the electoral\\ncollege needle.\\n\\nmccain would have to win every state where he now leads or is\\neffectively even in the polls (including north carolina, indiana\\nand missouri). he\\'d have to take florida and ohio, where he\\'s about\\nfour points down but where operatives on the ground give him a\\npretty good shot. that gets him to 247 of the 270 votes needed.\\n\\nmccain\\'s path to victory is then to snatch pennsylvania (which\\ngets him to 268), and win either virginia, colorado, nevada or new\\nmexico (states where he trails by about four to seven points) -- or\\nnew hampshire, where he\\'s 10 points behind, but twice won dramatic\\nprimary victories.\\n\\nas for pennsylvania, two recent polls have mccain closing to\\nwithin four points. pennsylvania is the state whose small-town\\nresidents were famously patronized by obama as \"bitter.\" one of\\npennsylvania\\'s democratic congressmen, john murtha, recently\\naccused many of his western pennsylvania constituents of being\\nracist. perhaps pennsylvanians will want to send a little message\\nto the democratic party. and that could tip the election to mccain.\\n\\nit\\'s an inside straight. but i\\'ve seen gamblers draw them.\\n\\nif mccain wins, think of this column as a modest contribution to\\ncheering up distraught liberals. if obama prevails, i\\'m confident\\nthere are some compassionate liberals out there who will do the\\nsame for hapless conservatives as they hobble out to the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nby the end of the giants\\' 35-14 rout of\\ndallas on sunday, jerry jones, the cowboys\\' owner, might have\\nsearched the waiver wire for seth maxwell, the quarterback in peter\\ngent\\'s 1973 novel, \"north dallas forty.\"\\n\\nwho could blame him? with tony romo out for the third\\nconsecutive week with a broken pinkie, the cowboys looked weak on\\noffense, first with brad johnson at quarterback, then with brooks\\nbollinger. the giants intercepted three passes.\\n\\nromo is expected back for the next game, after dallas\\' bye week.\\nin the meantime, the last-place cowboys (5-4) will look up and at\\nsome distance in the national football conference east to the\\nfirst-place giants (7-1).\\n\\n\"we\\'re not what i thought we would be at the backup,\" jones\\nsaid after the game as his players filed out past him. \"but i\\ndon\\'t want to load this whole thing on the backup quarterback. he\\'s\\nnot playing behind the team that i thought we\\'d be playing\\nbehind.\"\\n\\ngiants quarterback eli manning threw three touchdown passes but\\nturned the ball over three times, twice on fumbles and once on an\\ninterception that was returned for a touchdown. he completed 16 of\\n27 passes for 147 yards.\\n\\nhis touchdown passes were to kevin boss (13 yards), steve smith\\n(5 yards) and amani toomer (11 yards). running back brandon jacobs\\ncarried 17 times for 117 yards, including a touchdown run of 12\\nyards. derrick ward had a 17-yard touchdown run.\\n\\nseveral key cowboys missed the game with injuries, which would\\nhave made a dallas victory a shock in this game between\\nlongstanding rivals. the cowboys were a popular preseason pick to\\nwin the super bowl, and the giants are the defending super bowl\\nchampions, so the feelings between the teams were especially\\nsensitive.\\n\\n\"we hate each other, that\\'s just how it is,\" jacobs said.\\n\\ndefensive end justin tuck, who had two and a half of the giants\\'\\nfour sacks, said, more gently: \"i don\\'t like to throw the word\\n\\'hatred\\' around. there\\'s a dislike that comes from mutual\\nrespect.\"\\n\\ntuck added that the giants still must play four divisional\\ngames, including one at dallas against what may be a healthy romo.\\n\"we\\'re not smiling at anything now,\" tuck said.\\n\\ntuck and his fellow defenders held running back marion barber to\\n54 yards on 19 carries. cornerback corey webster intercepted two\\npasses by johnson, and safety james butler stole one by bollinger.\\nwebster said they were just doing their share.\\n\\n\"the d-linemen have been doing their thing for a number of\\nyears,\" webster said. \"it was our time to pick up our end of the\\ndeal.\"\\n\\nmanning\\'s interception in the second quarter led to a 23-yard\\ntouchdown return by mike jenkins that cut the giants\\' lead to 14-7.\\nthe pass was intended for plaxico burress, who ran long and behind\\nthe secondary as manning expected him to cut off a shorter route.\\n\\n\"i read one thing, and he didn\\'t,\" burress said, \"and it\\nresulted in a touchdown for those guys.\" on the sideline\\nimmediately afterward, burress appeared to speak in a demonstrative\\nway, waving his arms.\\n\\nafterward, manning seemed to confirm the diagnosis of burress.\\n\\n\"he probably made the right read,\" manning said. \"a bad play\\nby me.\"\\n\\nreferring to his team\\'s status at midseason, manning said:\\n\"seven and one is a great place to be. we couldn\\'t ask for much\\nmore.\"\\n\\nburress later dropped two passes, including one in the end zone,\\nbut he was not the only giant unable to capture catchable balls.\\nward and madison hedgecock also dropped passes. in last week\\'s\\n21-14 victory at pittsburgh, the giants dropped five passes.\\n\\nthe cowboys made it close again, briefly, in the first minute of\\nthe fourth quarter, when bollinger threw an 8-yard touchdown pass\\nto terrell owens that cut the giants\\' lead to 28-14.\\n\\nthe drive, traveling 75 yards and lasting 16 plays, was aided by\\na roughing-the-passer call against tuck.\\n\\nthe play appeared to be a clean, hard knockdown after an\\nincomplete pass on third down. tuck was flagged for landing with\\nhis full 274 pounds on the quarterback.\\n\\n\"i thought the object of hitting the quarterback is to land on\\nhim,\" tuck said. \"i guess, in the air, i\\'ve got to twist my body\\nto land on the ground.\"\\n\\ndown the hall, jones had other things to worry about. but, as\\nthe giants showed the cowboys last season with a postseason upset\\nin dallas, the division winners do not always win their playoff\\ngames, and the wild-card qualifier can win the super bowl.\\n\\n\"you have to be quite the optimist, and i don\\'t know that i\\'m\\nthat much of an optimist,\" jones said of the divisional race. but,\\nhe added: \"crazy things happen. it doesn\\'t change what i think we\\nhave a chance to do.\"\\n\\nin the face of a bitter defeat, denver broncos receiver brandon\\nmarshall turned and ran.\\n\\nis that how a winner acts?\\n\\nor did marshall quit?\\n\\n\"he\\'s one of those soft receivers where he has to have the ball\\nall the time. if he don\\'t get it, he\\'s going to mope and cry,\"\\nmiami dolphins linebacker joey porter said sunday.\\n\\nif you believe porter, one of the main reasons the dolphins\\nupset denver 26-17 sunday is because the visitors got in the face\\nof marshall and messed with his mind until the young receiver\\ncracked.\\n\\n\"we got in his head, and he pretty much was done,\" said\\nporter, who insisted marshall psyched himself right out of the\\ngame.\\n\\nfaced with the harsh reality of the final score, frustrated by a\\nlousy individual performance, victimized by a bad call that\\nnullified a touchdown catch and dissed by smack talk for which he\\nhad no response, marshall quickly bolted off the field and into the\\nstadium tunnel leading to the denver locker room.\\n\\non a reeling denver team that has dropped four of five decisions\\nafter a 3-0 start, it\\'s fair to ask: is marshall mentally tough\\nenough to lead the broncos out of this mess?\\n\\n\"i\\'m definitely disappointed,\" admitted marshall, credited\\nwith only two catches for 27 yards against the dolphins.\\n\"definitely frustrated.\"\\n\\nand it showed.\\n\\n\"i went looking for him after the game, but he ran to the\\nlocker room,\" said porter, who loves to talk trash and has the pro\\nbowl credentials to back up his sharp tongue.\\n\\ndid porter actually try to track down marshall?\\n\\n\"yeah, how do you know i seen that he was the first one off the\\nfield? i was looking for him. and he was the first one out of\\nthere,\" porter said.\\n\\nas defenses have gotten tougher on marshall and his receiving\\nnumbers have gone in steady decline, opponents now see how he\\npouts. it\\'s a sign of vulnerability no player can afford in the\\nnfl.\\n\\n\"i\\'m not selfish, but i\\'m a wide receiver,\" marshall said.\\n\"i\\'m not asking for the ball every play, but i would love for us\\nto throw every play.\"\\n\\nfrom the anger with which marshall snapped the chinstrap off his\\nhelmet when his 77-yard touchdown catch was wiped out by a pass\\ninterference penalty that appeared incorrect, to the way\\nquarterback jay cutler trudges back to the bench after another\\nineffective set of downs by an offense that has lost its mojo, the\\nbody language of denver\\'s young stars too often suggests they are\\nbeaten men.\\n\\nporter knows any player capable of catching 18 passes in a\\nsingle game is talented. but here\\'s his advice to marshall: grow\\nup.\\n\\nrather than taking the double-coverage the dolphins used to\\nblanket marshall as a compliment, he got so mad that porter\\ndetected an undeniable loss of composure.\\n\\nif marshall comes unglued, how can we expect the broncos to keep\\nit together, even in the afc west, the division that makes a parody\\nof parity? the team needs marshall to lead, not whine.\\n\\nduring a break in the action before the fourth quarter began,\\nporter broke away from miami\\'s defensive huddle to shout across the\\nline of scrimmage at marshall, until he could no longer ignore the\\nabuse.\\n\\nit was a pitiful sight for a broncos team that now appears too\\nimmature and emotionally fragile to handle the pressure of a league\\nthat shows no mercy for the weak or wounded.\\n\\n\"once i know you\\'re frustrated, i\\'m going to ride you all the\\nway into the dirt,\" porter said.\\n\\n\"i seen he was frustrated, because he went from not talking to\\nme to wanting to talk to me every play. why you talking to me? i\\'m\\nnot even covering you. so when you give me all your attention, i\\nknow you\\'re not on your game.\"\\n\\nunnerved to the point of distraction in front of 75,000 irked\\npaying customers, all marshall could do was stand there and take\\nthe tongue-lashing from an opponent laughing in his face.\\n\\nif this is where this denver team comes undone, then we will\\nremember it as the sad scene where the season faded to black.\\n\\nmark kiszla is a sports columnist for the

history of american\\nprofessional football.\\n\\nat the halfway point, the broncos are at their lowest point -\\n4-4. some run they\\'re having now. daylight saving time goes, and\\nthe broncos run to darkness.\\n\\nas in 2007, the broncos\\' season might as well be over on nov. 1.\\n\\nin 1972, against the oakland raiders, the broncos ran for only\\n13 yards. so, the broncos finally raced past

- as far as anybody could tell. and here\\'s how the broncos\\nestablished run:\\n\\non the first play of the game, pittman lost a yard, then gained\\na yard (to be back where he started). then cutler flung his eighth\\ninterception of the season.\\n\\nthe broncos couldn\\'t establish the passing game, either.\\n\\nin the rest of the quarter pittman went for 2 yards, torain for\\n3, torain for minus-2.\\n\\nthat would be 3 reeking yards. they added two more in the half.\\nthat\\'s not a joke, but the running game certainly was a joke. where\\nhave you gone, terrell davis? clinton portis?

five\\ntouchdowns.\\n\\ndespite his boasts, young can\\'t get on the field, and as\\nshanahan had suggested, he is an injury always happening. pittman\\nwas impressive briefly, but got a stinger and left early on sunday.\\nhall fumbled twice against new england and didn\\'t participate\\nagainst the dolphins until one late carry.\\n\\nand torain, who is supposed to be ryan\\'s express or the

seemed to be his stage, as he twirled\\nhis bat at the plate and hit home runs when it mattered most.\\n\\nbut this has been a very different fall for leyritz. now 44 and\\neight years into his retirement from baseball, he has been shunned\\nby the yankees. the nearly $11 million he earned as a player is\\ngone, along with his lucrative speaking career. leyritz is awaiting\\ntrial in florida on charges of manslaughter and driving under the\\ninfluence of alcohol after a crash last december that killed\\n30-year-old fredia ann veitch. if convicted, he faces up to 15\\nyears in prison.\\n\\nthe player once known for his designer sunglasses and outsize\\nswagger is so broke that he said he had sought aid from the\\nbaseball assistance team, a charity that helps former players\\nthrough tough times. \"they basically have been a savior,\" leyritz\\nsaid in a recent interview. \"if it wasn\\'t for them, i don\\'t know\\nwhat i would have done.\"\\n\\nthe fable of the self-destructive athlete has been told before,\\nand the leyritz version follows a familiar outline: misspent\\nfortune, messy divorce, fast lifestyle and a trip to the county\\njail. but other details of his life do not fit as easily into the\\ntypical narrative.\\n\\nleyritz is the primary caregiver to his three sons, ages 13, 12,\\nand 7, who live with him in the spotless home he rents in davie, a\\nfort lauderdale suburb. after his divorce and custody battle,\\nfriends say, leyritz started over and began earning a comfortable\\nincome from television appearances and corporate speaking\\nengagements.\\n\\nthen came the crash. a jury will decide whether it was the\\nresult of criminal behavior, and the trial is scheduled to begin\\nnext monday. leyritz\\'s friends and advocates say that no matter the\\noutcome, his children need him for emotional and financial support.\\n\\na day after veitch died, one of her children sent her a text\\nmessage, writing, \"i love you momma!! rest in peace,\" according\\nto telephone records in the state attorney\\'s file.\\n\\nhoward pomerantz, a lawyer for veitch\\'s family, said no one was\\nhelping her 14-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son. he described\\nleyritz as \"someone who has destroyed the lives of a number of\\npeople\" and questioned the propriety of giving him assistance.\\n\\n\"i\\'d be interested in learning whether the baseball assistance\\nteam takes into consideration whether they\\'re pouring salt in the\\nwounds in the victims in this case,\" he said.\\n\\njim martin, the executive director of the baseball assistance\\nteam, spoke about the program only in general because of privacy\\nrestrictions, and declined to say whether leyritz was receiving\\nhelp. in 2008, the charity has awarded more than 175 assistant\\ngrants to people affiliated with baseball. but he said he did not\\npass judgment on those in need, especially when children were\\ninvolved.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not the kids\\' fault when someone does something stupid,\"\\nmartin said.\\n\\nleyritz\\'s predicament is starkly different from his days as a\\nyankee. he was with the team from 1990 through 1996, then in 1999\\nand 2000. he is probably best known for his three-run homer in game\\n4 of the 1996 world series, which tied the score and led to a\\nvictory over atlanta.\\n\\nin the clubhouse, leyritz had a reputation as a brash upstart,\\nand he was overshadowed by teammates like don mattingly and derek\\njeter. still, fans appreciated his clutch performances in the\\npostseason. by the time he left baseball in 2000, leyritz had\\nearned at least $10.7 million in 11 major league seasons, according\\nto the web site baseball-reference.com.\\n\\nlike many professional athletes facing retirement, leyritz\\nstruggled with living an ordinary life. he and his wife, karri\\nleyritz, consumed lavishly during his yankees career. in court\\nfilings, leyritz\\'s lawyer acknowledged that they had spent

county\\ncourthouse depict a vicious battle in which the couple bickered\\nover everything from who should get the ford expedition to the\\nwhereabouts of leyritz\\'s 1999 world series ring.\\n\\nin 2004, a social worker concluded in a custody evaluation that\\nneither leyritz was an ideal parent. karri leyritz\\'s live-in\\nboyfriend had a long criminal history, and in 2003, she tested\\npositive for benzodiazepines, antianxiety drugs for which she did\\nnot have a prescription. jim leyritz, according to the report, used\\namphetamines and drank heavily as a player. the social worker also\\nreported that a marriage counselor determined that he was\\nstruggling with \"learning to cope with life transitions and\\nadjusting to life without baseball.\"\\n\\nhe and his wife, leyritz told the social worker, had led a\\n\"partying lifestyle.\" but he also said: \"my life is my children.\\ni have had my fun, now they are more important to me.\"\\n\\nthe social worker ultimately recommended that the leyritzes\\nshare parenting responsibilities, but that jim leyritz be the\\nprimary residential parent.\\n\\nalthough the leyritzes were unemployed, they frequently placed\\nthe children in after-school day care and, in karri\\'s case, left\\nthem with baby sitters, according to the custody evaluation and the\\ntranscript of a hearing before the divorce judge. teachers reported\\nthat the children were often absent when in karri\\'s care, and when\\nthey did attend, they did not have lunch, were missing socks or\\nwore disheveled, torn uniforms.\\n\\njudge lawrence korda admonished the leyritzes to spend more time\\nwith their children. \"to me, if two parents aren\\'t working and\\nboth of them are posing as incredibly involved parents, then go get\\nyour kids,\" he said.\\n\\nafter an initial interview in september, leyritz declined to\\nanswer further questions, including inquiries about his divorce,\\nsaying he was speaking exclusively to another publication. but\\nkarri leyritz said the breakup coincided with his exit from\\nprofessional baseball and was a difficult period for both of them.\\n\"we were both just going through a terrible time,\" she said.\\n\\nnow, karri leyritz said, the children spend nearly equal time\\nwith each parent. she said they had begun to settle into a routine.\\n\\n\"he\\'s a great father and that\\'s really all,\" she said.\\n\"obviously, we didn\\'t get along as husband and wife, but you have\\nto come to an understanding.\"\\n\\nleyritz\\'s easygoing, charismatic demeanor made him popular on\\nthe speaking circuit. last year, he received repeat requests to\\nappear at corporate sales meetings, little league banquets and\\nyankees luxury suites, engagements that his agent, andrew levy,\\nsaid paid up to $7,500 each. leyritz said he attended 50 events in\\n2007, in addition to working that season as a yankees reporter for\\nespn radio in new york. his contract for 2008 was not extended, a\\ndecision that was made before he was arrested.\\n\\n\"he was starting to turn a corner,\" said todd watson, a close\\nfriend. \"he was starting to become a household name.\"\\n\\neverything changed early on dec. 28, 2007. after a night out\\nwith friends to celebrate his birthday, leyritz ran a red light\\nabout 3:20 a.m. and crashed into a car driven by veitch, who had\\nbeen drinking after finishing her shift as a bartender, according\\nto authorities. she was thrown from the car and later died.\\n\\nan officer on the scene described leyritz as having bloodshot,\\nglassy eyes and a flushed face. the officer reported smelling a\\n\"slight odor of alcohol coming from his breath as he spoke.\"\\nleyritz refused to submit to a breath test and failed a field\\nsobriety test. his blood alcohol level, tested at 6:10 a.m., was\\n0.14, well above florida\\'s limit of 0.08.\\n\\nleyritz is also the defendant in a civil case filed this year by\\nveitch\\'s estate. although he declined to speak about the accident,\\ncourt records show that the defense will probably argue that\\nleyritz cannot be entirely blamed for veitch\\'s death because she\\nwas also drunk -- her blood alcohol level was 0.18 -- and she was not\\nwearing a seat belt, according to the autopsy report.\\n\\n\"i think the evidence is so favorable on his side that\\nultimately he\\'s going to be exonerated of all charges on the\\ncriminal case, and i think we\\'re going to succeed in the defense of\\nthe civil case,\" said jeff ostrow, a lawyer for leyritz. \"not\\nonly was he not negligent, but she was the direct and proximate\\ncause of the accident.\"\\n\\nher lawyer holds the opposite view. \"whether or not she was\\nintoxicated is not relevant, because she was driving with a green\\nlight, in her own lane of traffic, within the speed limit, not\\nbreaking any laws and she was not in any way the cause of this\\naccident,\" pomerantz said.\\n\\nin a deposition for the civil case, an eyewitness, karen rivera,\\nreported that leyritz tried to shake veitch\\'s leg after the\\naccident and asked if veitch had been drinking. according to a\\npolice video taken on the scene, leyritz told an officer, \"she hit\\nme pretty good,\" and later did not appear to react when he was\\ntold veitch had died.\\n\\nfriends say that leyritz was in shock after the accident and\\nthat his involvement in it -- guilty or not -- has been difficult.\\n\\n\"he came and stayed with me for the first three days,\" karri\\nleyritz said. \"it was horrendous. i don\\'t wish that pain on my\\nworst enemy. believe me, it hit him.\"\\n\\nin the interview, leyritz declined to comment on his feelings\\nabout the accident. but he did sometimes show frustration at those\\nwho have avoided him since the crash. he said he was not invited to\\nthe all-star game in the bronx or to the yankee stadium finale this\\nyear. leyritz said that he had a ticket to the final game but that\\nhe was ejected from the vip area by a security guard and sat in the\\nstands with fans instead.\\n\\nthe yankees did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\n\"am i disappointed that there\\'s not a little bit more support\\nthere?\" leyritz said. \"i would say a little bit. but at the same\\ntime, i really, truly understand the reasonings.\"\\n\\nwatson said his friend deserved better.\\n\\n\"he\\'s not a leper and he\\'s innocent,\" watson said. \"you\\'re\\nguilty until you\\'re proven innocent in this country,\\nunfortunately.\"\\n\\nleyritz said the yankees were not alone in snubbing him.\\n\\n\"if it was just them doing it, i would say yeah,\" he said.\\n\"but you know what? it\\'s everything.\"\\n\\nin the year since the accident, leyritz has made unpaid\\nappearances at just three events. in september, he posed with fans\\nand signed autographs at suburban golf club in union, n.j., to\\nbenefit the local chamber of commerce.\\n\\nbill liederman, the event organizer, said his friend leyritz was\\nstill a yankees hero.\\n\\n\"this is a country of second chances,\" said liederman, the\\nformer owner of mickey mantle\\'s restaurant in manhattan. \"there is\\nno yankee fan alive who doesn\\'t think, regardless of the outcome of\\nthe trial, that he deserves one.\"\\n\\nlevy, leyritz\\'s agent, said that since the accident, corporate\\nevent organizers have asked to book leyritz, only to say a few\\nhours later that \"it\\'s just not going to work out for us right\\nnow.\"\\n\\nlevy did not have to ask why they canceled. \"i knew the\\nreason,\" he said.\\n\\nfor now, leyritz continues to depend on payments from the\\nbaseball assistance team, and he hopes that if he is exonerated,\\nthe work will return. the charity is not paying his legal bills, he\\nsaid, just basic living expenses.\\n\\n\"things so i am able to put a roof over my kids\\' head and food\\non the table,\" he said.\\n\\nprivate equity firms embarked on one of the biggest spending\\nsprees in corporate history for nearly three years, using borrowed\\nmoney to gobble up huge swaths of industries and some of the\\nbiggest names -- neiman marcus, metro-goldwyn-mayer and toys \"r\"\\nus, among them.\\n\\nthe new owners then saddled the companies with the billions of\\ndollars of debt used to buy them. but now many of the loans and\\nbonds sold to finance the deals are about to come due at the worst\\npossible time. like homeowners with an adjustable rate mortgage\\nthat just went up, some of private equity\\'s titans are facing a\\nhuge squeeze. and that is coming at the same time as consumers are\\nstaying home with their wallets closed.\\n\\nalready this year, big retailers backed by private equity, like\\nlinens \\'n things, mervyn\\'s and steve &amp;amp; barry\\'s, have filed for\\nbankruptcy. and analysts expect an even broader array of companies\\nbacked by private equity -- including resorts like harrah\\'s\\nentertainment and lenders like gmac, the financing arm of general\\nmotors -- to face even more pressure as profits shrivel and\\ncreditors come knocking.\\n\\n\"there\\'s absolutely going to a lot of pain to go around,\" said\\njosh lerner, a professor of investment banking at harvard business\\nschool, who wrote a seminal paper on private equity. \"the big\\nquestion is how apocalyptic it will be.\"\\n\\nprivate equity firms, which are lightly regulated, use\\ninvestors\\' money to buy undervalued public companies and take them\\nprivate.\\n\\nthe shakeout could have enormous implications for the economy:\\npeople who work for companies owned by private equity firms could\\nlose their jobs as firms cut costs to meet their debt obligations.\\nand private equity firms like apollo management, which owns\\nharrah\\'s and linens \\'n things, face deep markdowns on the value of\\ntheir holdings.\\n\\npension funds and college endowments that invested in these\\nfunds in recent years hoping for big returns are likely to suffer\\nas well, and many of those investors could face a cash squeeze\\nbecause they are probably going to have to hold onto their\\ninvestments for years, until the economy turns around.\\n\\n\"the dangling other shoe is now about to drop,\" said jeffrey\\na. sonnenfeld, senior associate dean of the yale school of\\nmanagement.\\n\\nwhen the economy was booming, the firms made huge profits by\\ncutting costs at their new acquisitions, improving operations and\\nthen turning around and selling them. in 2007, at the height of the\\nbubble, such deals totaled $796 billion, or more than 16 percent of\\nthe $4.83 trillion in all the deals made globally that year,\\naccording to data from dealogic.\\n\\nfirms like blackstone group and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp;amp; co.,\\nwhich faced an image problem at the height of the bubble for\\nexcessive compensation and beneficial tax treatment, but their\\nreturns were so high that even investors like pension funds were\\ndrawn in. now these firms, built on enormous amounts of debt, are\\nbeing forced to go back to the financial markets just as those\\nmarkets have nearly frozen up. if history is any guide, the worst\\nmay be yet to come. steven n. kaplan, a professor at university of\\nchicago graduate school of business, found that nearly 30 percent\\nof all big public-to-private deals made from 1986 to 1989\\ndefaulted. afterward, private equity players were called in front\\nof congress and movies like \"wall street\" and \"other people\\'s\\nmoney\" were made depicting financiers as greedy criminals.\\n\\nto be sure, many companies that were not purchased by private\\nequity firms are also struggling. circuit city, the longtime seller\\nof consumer electronics, is trying to stave off a bankruptcy\\nfiling. and publicly traded automakers like gm are troubled, too.\\n(gm wants to merge with the struggling chrysler, which is owned by\\nprivate equity.)\\n\\nmany industry insiders and analysts contend that private\\nequity-backed companies will not suffer nearly as much as those in\\nthe late 1980s, because the firms pushed for better financing\\nconditions that allow them to keep operating even if they cannot\\nmake their debt payments.\\n\\nfor example, in an effort to save cash, six of apollo\\'s\\nportfolio companies, including claire\\'s stores, harrah\\'s and\\nrealogy, have announced this year that they will pay some of their\\nbonds\\' interest payments by issuing more debt.\\n\\nkaplan said he believed that while \"it isn\\'t going to be\\npretty,\" today\\'s deals \"are much less fragile and used less\\nleverage.\" he contended that \"on a relative basis to investment\\nbanks and hedge funds, private equity may be in a better place\"\\nbecause of its long-term focus.\\n\\nstephen a. schwarzman, chairman of blackstone group, remains\\ncommitted to the future of private equity. \"the people rooting for\\nthe collapse of private equity are going to be disappointed,\" he\\nsaid. while some companies may find themselves in trouble, he said,\\nmany more will be able to ride out a downturn in the economy\\nbecause of the lax financing conditions that banks agreed to at the\\ntop of the market.\\n\\nhe added that he believes that now may be the best time for\\nprivate equity because of the investment opportunities amid the\\ncrisis. \"historically, downturns are when the most money gets\\nmade,\" he said. shares of blackstone are hovering at around $10,\\ndown from the $31 they were at when blackstone went public in june\\n2007. (fortress investment group, another big firm, is trading at\\n$4.90 a share, down from its initial price of $35 in february\\n2007.)\\n\\nlerner, of the harvard business school, said that trouble among\\nprivate equity firms would probably \"precipitate hard questions\\nabout the compensation and fee structure\" in the industry. the\\nfirms generally take fees of 2 percent of all money managed and 20\\npercent of profits. \"i would not be surprised if they try to head\\nof the criticism by returning capital,\" he said.\\n\\nthe problem for recent deals is that many firms waded into\\neconomically sensitive sectors like retailing and restaurants.\\nfirms like apollo, cerberus capital management and sun capital\\npartners purchased several troubled companies to turn around from\\n2004 through the first half of 2007.\\n\\nin the case of linens \\'n things, a longtime also-ran to bed,\\nbath &amp;amp; beyond, apollo knew that it had a tough job ahead of it, yet\\nit still added lots of debt. two months before linens \\'n things was\\nacquired, it reported $2.1 million in long-term debt; by dec. 31,\\n2007, that amount had exploded to $855 million.\\n\\nat the time, private equity firms assumed that they could\\nrefinance their portfolio companies\\' debt cheaply. but many appear\\nto have been blindsided by the size and severity of the credit\\nmarket meltdown, which has left lenders unable or unwilling to loan\\nout more money.\\n\\nin what seems a worrisome trend, many bonds of private\\nequity-backed companies have recently plummeted in value, signaling\\nworries about their solvency. these include michaels, the crafts\\nstore co-owned by bain capital and the blackstone group; dollar\\ngeneral, a low-price retailer taken private by kohlberg kravis\\nroberts; and realogy, the parent company of the real estate\\nbrokerage firms coldwell banker and century 21 that is owned by\\napollo management.\\n\\nthe bonds issued by harrah\\'s entertainment, for example, were\\ntrading at 16.5 cents on the dollar, signaling investors\\' belief\\nthat the company was drawing closer to a potential default.\\nharrah\\'s, too, was saddled with a lot of debt when it was taken\\nprivate. a month before the closing of the harrah\\'s takeover, the\\ncompany reported $12.4 billion in long-term debt. by june 30, that\\nfigure had swollen to $23.9 billion. harrah\\'s has already begun\\nmaking selective staff cuts and has begun scaling back costs, even\\ncutting back hours in its vip lounge and the complimentary rooms\\nand meals for its best customers.\\n\\n\"unfortunately, the worst-case scenario is now looking like the\\nbest case scenario,\" analysts from creditsights, a research firm,\\nwrote in a research note on oct. 17 about harrah\\'s. \"while the\\ncompany could be able to pull through unscathed, the market is\\ngiving little credit to do so.\"\\n\\nif tuesday\\'s election were confined to white america, polls\\nshow, sen. barack obama would lose.\\n\\nand yet obama\\'s strength across racial lines lies at the heart\\nof his lead in the polls over sen. john mccain heading into\\nelection day. remarkably, obama, the first black major party\\npresidential nominee, trails among whites by less than democratic\\nnominees normally do.\\n\\namerica\\'s political parties grew decisively polarized by race\\nafter 1964, the year president lyndon b. johnson signed civil\\nrights legislation that his republican presidential opponent, barry\\ngoldwater, opposed. since then, election pollsters estimate,\\ndemocratic nominees have averaged 39 percent of the white vote. in\\nlast week\\'s new york times/cbs news poll, obama drew 44 percent\\nsupport among whites -- a higher proportion than bill clinton\\ncaptured in his general election victories.\\n\\nanalysts ascribe that success to changing racial attitudes,\\nobama\\'s deftness, republican missteps and the economic crisis.\\nwhatever the cause, when combined with his two-to-one edge among\\nhispanics and his 10-to-1 edge among blacks, it has given him a\\nnational election-eve lead.\\n\\nthe race is not over, and election day could bring surprises.\\nand mccain is capturing a majority of the white vote, according to\\nthese same polls. yet population shifts have made racial and ethnic\\ndiversity an unavoidable fact of american life. when ronald reagan\\nwon re-election in 1984, whites made up 86 percent of the\\nelectorate; by 2004, they had dropped to 77 percent.\\n\\nwith that backdrop, some observers say racial attitudes have\\ndiminished as an independent force, fading into the broader fabric\\nof cultural concerns that shape voters\\' choices like religion,\\nabortion and gun control.\\n\\n\"anybody who votes against barack obama because of the color of\\nhis skin, the republicans would have gotten on another cultural\\nissue,\" said david saunders, a consultant in virginia who advises\\ndemocratic candidates on attracting white rural and working-class\\nvoters.\\n\\nthe presidential historian michael beschloss credits obama with\\nreprising the approach adopted by john f. kennedy in his 1960\\nbreakthrough as the first roman catholic to win the presidency.\\n\"he was running to be president of all the people, not president\\nof a faction,\" beschloss said.\\n\\na recent nbc news/wall street journal poll documents obama\\'s\\nsuccess in making that case. asked whether an obama presidency\\nwould favor the interests of blacks over other americans, eight in\\n10 whites said it would not.\\n\\nfor democratic strategists who have spent their careers laboring\\nto regain white voters\\' allegiance, that alone is a striking\\nachievement. in the mid-1980s, research by the pollster stan\\ngreenberg in macomb county, mich., concluded that middle-class\\nwhites resented the \"raw deal\" they received from a political\\ndebate in which democrats appeared focused on racial minorities and\\nthe poor.\\n\\nlike greenberg\\'s client bill clinton in 1992, obama has\\nemphasized broad-gauged assistance for the middle class. \"he\\'s\\nmanaged to campaign in ways that may not have changed their world\\nview but have allowed them to put those feelings aside,\" greenberg\\nsaid. he added with a note of bemusement, \"maybe he has crossed\\nover into tiger woods territory.\"\\n\\nfrustrated republicans see obama\\'s steady performances on the\\nstump and in debates as only part of the explanation for his\\nsurprising level of white support. just as responsible, some argue,\\nis that president bush\\'s unpopularity in threatening economic times\\nhas veered close to herbert hoover territory. \"you\\'ve got to give\\nobama an awful lot of credit for his likeability,\" said tom slade,\\na former florida republican party chairman, who abandoned his own\\ndemocratic allegiance in 1964 in the early phase of white\\nconservatives\\' political migration. more important, he said, \"we\\nhave done a miserable job of managing the affairs of government.\"\\n\\nin the early 1990s, the political reporter peter brown wrote\\n\"minority party,\" a book exploring the pitfalls of the democrats\\'\\nidentification with the interests of african-americans. he credited\\nobama with providing \"a comfort zone\" for white voters, but\\npointed to the major boost he received this fall from the financial\\ncrisis on the watch of a republican president.\\n\\n\"the most important color is green,\" said brown, now assistant\\ndirector of the quinnipiac university polling institute. \"when\\nlehman bros. went under, this thing changed dramatically. people\\nare just terrified about their financial futures.\"\\n\\nin the spring, some democratic strategists feared obama might be\\ncrippled in states where he lost working-class white primary voters\\ndecisively to sen. hillary rodham clinton. in ohio, carried by bush\\nin 2000 and 2004, polls now show obama is competitive; in\\npennsylvania, a top target for mccain, he is ahead in the polls.\\n\\nwith a message muting racial concerns, obama didn\\'t begin his\\npresidential bid with overwhelming strength among blacks; that came\\nonly after he defeated clinton in the white-dominated iowa\\ncaucuses. \"ironically, the biggest difficulty about race for obama\\nwas the doubts among african-americans about his ability to succeed\\nin the nominating process,\" said tad devine, a top strategist for\\nal gore in 2000 and john kerry in 2004.\\n\\n\"it\\'s amazing to me -- almost unreal,\" said rep. john lewis,\\nd-ga. earlier this fall lewis, a civil rights movement veteran,\\naccused mccain\\'s campaign of \"sowing the seeds of hatred\" in a\\nway that was reminiscent of george wallace during the 1960s, an\\nattack that mccain called \"brazen and baseless\" and that obama\\ndistanced himself from.\\n\\nmore recently, lewis added, the campaign has made him \"sort of\\nsad\" since leaders of that movement, including the rev. dr. martin\\nluther king jr. and president johnson, cannot witness obama\\'s\\ncandidacy.\\n\\non deck\\n\\n-- we are running out of decks. this is the last day before\\nelection day, and the daily countdown ends.\\n\\n-- for the candidates now it is all about turnout and getting out\\nbase voters; there aren\\'t many people left to convince. sen. john\\nmccain is doing a seven-state swing -- airport hangar rallies --\\nwhile sen. barack obama is in florida, virginia and north carolina,\\nan appropriately aggressive finale to his campaign.\\n\\n-- and we are getting ready to bid goodbye to what has been the\\nmost compelling campaign we have witnessed. here\\'s hoping that you\\nenjoyed reading about it as much as we

campaign, a tribute to the forum he has\\nbecome so identified with during his two runs for president. and\\nmccain did it in new hampshire, which delivered primary victories\\nfor him in 2000 and 2008. though this state went democratic in\\n2004, he is hoping that it will support him on tuesday. \"my\\nfriends,\" he said, \"the mac is back!\"\\n\\n-- barack obama is perhaps not as superstitious, appearing at a\\npacked-to-the-rafters campaign rally in cleveland with bruce\\nspringsteen. you would find nothing but respect here for\\nspringsteen, but let it not be forgotten that he appeared at a\\nsimilarly packed rally for john kerry in 2004, who went on to lose,\\nas the republican national committee quickly pointed out.\\n\\n-- talk of the end infused the candidates\\' speeches, with sarah\\npalin referring to \"the 11th hour\" in criticizing obama\\'s tax\\nplan.\\n\\ntakeaway: the gates are closing. the time for new speeches, new\\nproposals and new attacks has passed. now there is one goal:\\ngetting their supporters to the polls. \"ohio, i have two words for\\nyou,\" obama said. \"two days.\"\\n\\n-- adam nagourney\\n\\nin the home stretch, the tongue stumbles\\n\\nwhen you speak thousands upon thousands of words in public each\\nday, some of them are bound to come out a bit twisted from time to\\ntime -- especially during the grueling, sleepless,\\nwhat-state-are-we-in final days of a presidential campaign.\\n\\nmost of the time they are not so much gaffes as odd verbal\\nhiccups. so there was sen. john mccain, the republican presidential\\nnominee, on sunday in wallingford, pa., offering up a novel\\ndescription of supply-side economics with his observation that\\n\"keeping taxes low creates jobs, keeps money in your pants and\\nstrengthens our economy.\"\\n\\nand sen. joseph r. biden jr. in melbourne, fla., on tuesday,\\nmangling the name of the republican vice-presidential nominee as\\n\"sarah mccain,\" and making each day seem extraordinarily long\\nwhen he said there were \"seven more weeks\" until the election.\\n\\ntime -- often an elastic concept on the trail -- also tripped up\\nhis republican counterpart, gov. sarah palin, who may be hoping\\nthat none of her supporters in canton, ohio, wait until wednesday\\nto vote. on a campaign stop there sunday palin told them, \"now\\nwith just three days from the election, the time for choosing is\\nnear.\" two hours later in marietta, she corrected herself: \"we\\nare just two days away from the election!\"\\n\\nand sen. barack obama, the democratic presidential nominee,\\nmixed up his fictional do-gooders sunday in columbus, ohio, as he\\nreached for a new simile to make his argument that mccain has been\\na \"sidekick\" to president bush. \"he is like kato to the green\\nlantern,\" he said. \"you all remember that, those of you over a\\ncertain age?\"\\n\\nif the remark drew little crowd reaction, perhaps it was because\\nobama had the wrong green guy. he apparently meant to say green\\nhornet, to whom kato (memorably played by bruce lee) was the\\nsidekick.\\n\\n-- michaelcooper\\n\\nsigns of a shift\\n\\ncanal winchester, ohio -- six months ago, the rev. rod parsley\\nwas one of the more prominent evangelicals to hail mccain as a\\n\"strong, true, consistent conservative.\"\\n\\nbut two days before the election, in a state central to mccain\\'s\\nhopes, parsley preached to his vast congregation at world harvest\\nchurch of hellfire and \"circling in on a fight with the eternal\\nforces of darkness\" without ever mentioning mccain.\\n\\nin part, parsley\\'s choice could reflect the vagaries of\\npresidential politics. mccain was forced to disavow him last spring\\nafter church tapes revealed that parsley had repeatedly claimed\\nthat america was founded, in part, to destroy the \"false\\nreligion\" of islam.\\n\\nstill, some who have studied the evangelical movement see signs\\nof splintering, as younger evangelicals begin to assert their own\\npolitical identity. and obama has courted them with great ardor.\\n\\n\"you are starting to see some fragmentation; it could be that\\nthe days of a monolithic bloc of evangelicals are over,\" said mark\\ncaleb smith, director of the center for political studies at\\ncedarville university, a christian school. \"the children of the\\nfirst generation of evangelical leaders are of voting age, and they\\nare questioning old allegiances.\"\\n\\nnot all churches remained silent in ohio. pastors in a number of\\nthe historically black churches all but openly endorsed obama. and\\nwhite pastors in liberal leaning congregations, like the rev.\\ntimothy c. ahrens at the first congregational church, united church\\nof christ in columbus, showered praise on obama without handing\\ndown an endorsement.\\n\\nlast sunday, ahrens noted in his sermon: \"what excites me today\\nabout the historic race of barack obama is that we have reached the\\nplace in our country\\'s history that a biracial leader can ascend to\\nthe office of president. whether he wins or loses, this candidacy\\nis remarkable.\"\\n\\n-- michaelpowell\\n\\na political boss sounds off\\n\\ncleveland -- for the last year, the classics of bruce springsteen\\nhave played at obama\\'s rallies, the soundtrack to yet another\\ncampaign.\\n\\nso when springsteen came to the cleveland mall on sunday to\\nperform in person, a crowd spilled into lakeside avenue and the\\nsurrounding streets. obama may have been the night\\'s headliner, but\\nthe sun was shining on the boss.\\n\\nhe sang a series of hits, then gave his own political talk.\\n\\n\"today, we are at the crossroads. it\\'s been a long, long, long\\ntime coming,\" springsteen said. \"i want my country back, i want\\nmy dream back, i want my america back. now is the time to stand\\nwith barack obama, roll up our sleeves and come on up for the\\nrising.\"\\n\\nwith that, springsteen went into the song that introduces obama\\nat every rally. but a few minutes after obama took the stage, a\\npleasant day faded and the skies opened into a downpour.\\n\\n\"we\\'ve been through an eight-year storm,\" obama said.\\n\"sunshine is on the way.\" he added, \"we\\'ve just got two more\\ndays of these clouds.\"\\n\\nsome did not want to wait. as obama delivered his stump speech,\\ngoing slightly longer than 30 minutes, the crowd, which the police\\nestimated at 60,000, began to dissipate.\\n\\nobama did not seem deterred, largely because he was joined by\\nhis wife and two daughters for the final weekend of campaigning.\\n\\n\"when they\\'re with you on the road, boy, everything looks a\\nlittle better,\" obama said. \"the crowds seem to grow and\\neverybody\\'s got a smile on their face. you start thinking that\\nmaybe we might be able to win an election on nov. 4.\"\\n\\n-- jeffzeleny\\n\\nbambi can relax\\n\\nas mccain\\'s motorcade wound through golden-leaved valleys on\\nsaturday in bucks county, pa., a pair of hunters watched from the\\nside of the road, not so much clinging to their guns as keeping\\nthem tucked under their arms. minutes later, when mccain arrived at\\na rally in perkasie, several people held signs declaring\\n\"sportsmen for mccain\" and one man, in an homage to ohio\\'s\\nbest-known plumber, held one identifying himself as \"joe the\\nhunter.\"\\n\\n\"we\\'re glad you\\'re here,\" sen. lindsey graham of south\\ncarolina said in his warm-up speech. \"i know the mccain family\\'s\\nglad you\\'re here. i\\'m glad you\\'re here.\" then he paused a beat:\\n\"the deer are glad you\\'re here.\"\\n\\n-- michael cooper\\n\\nabderrahim goumri of morocco sailed into central park\\ncomfortably in the lead of the new york city marathon on sunday,\\nfeeling good about winning his first major marathon. he said he had\\nno worries about the drink stations he had missed along the route.\\nhe certainly did not have any thoughts about how he had finished\\nsecond a year ago, losing a tight race in the final half-mile.\\n\\nbut as goumri repeatedly peered over his shoulder during the\\nfinal two and a half miles, he kept seeing the brazilian marilson\\ngomes dos santos running behind him. they snaked through central\\npark this way, with gomes never fading from the picture.\\n\\n\"for me, the race is decided in the end,\" gomes said, via an\\ninterpreter. \"in the marathon, you know you have won the race when\\nyou cross the finish line, not before.\"\\n\\nwith less than a mile to go, those missed drink stops might have\\ntaken their toll on goumri. he stiffened and faltered as gomes\\nsurged into a new gear. he passed goumri and won his second new\\nyork city marathon, in 2 hours 8 minutes 43 seconds.\\n\\ngoumri finished 24 seconds later, disappointed and spent, a\\nrepeat of his second-place finish a year ago, when martin lel of\\nkenya outsprinted him at the end.\\n\\n\"after i pass marilson and i think i had almost 10 seconds, 15\\nseconds, i said, \\'it\\'s my day,\"\\' goumri said. \"but, it\\'s\\nfinishing a marathon. i turned back and saw marilson come back. i\\nsaid, \\'i think he is going to win today.\"\\'\\n\\ngoumri, now with three second-place finishes in major marathons,\\nvowed to return. \"i hope i can come back one day and i should win\\none day, no problem,\" he said.\\n\\ndaniel rono of kenya finished third in 2:11:22.\\n\\nfor gomes, 31, the finish brought back a rush of memories. when\\nhe won here in 2006, he was almost unknown outside of brazil, and\\nit was part of the reason he won. when he surged ahead of the pack\\non first avenue in manhattan, with more than six miles to go in the\\nrace, none of the top contenders followed him. paul tergat, the\\nformer marathon world-record holder from kenya, who was fourth on\\nsunday, later said that he had no idea who gomes was.\\n\\ngomes cruised to that finish relatively unchallenged, and the\\nmarathon world -- including the television broadcasters -- scrambled\\nto find out just who had so unexpectedly swiped the title.\\n\\nthat race vaulted gomes into the realm of the sport\\'s stars.\\nback in brazil, a country usually fixated on its soccer stars,\\ngomes became an unlikely hero. a parade greeted his return.\\n\\n\"without a doubt, to win a great event like new york is great\\nfor anybody,\" gomes said. \"i am very well known in brazil.\\neverybody recognizes me. the young kids running now, they look up\\nto me. there\\'s a lot of new running groups in brazil, and the\\npeople recognize who i am and what i did.\"\\n\\ngomes has not been able to come close to that result since. he\\nran the london and new york marathons last year and finished eighth\\nin each. he could not finish the olympic marathon in beijing,\\nblaming the heat and humidity.\\n\\nmeanwhile, goumri, 32, was taking the marathon world by storm.\\nhe finished second in his debut, the london marathon, in 2007, when\\nlel outkicked him at the end to win by three seconds. in new york\\nlater in the year, lel again pulled away in the final half-mile to\\nbeat goumri by 12 seconds.\\n\\ngoumri also had high hopes in the olympics, but after running\\nstrong early, faded and finished 20th.\\n\\nhere, he thought he had put all of that behind him. he called\\nmissing his drink stations a costly mistake. he said he was\\nconcentrating on the race; several times, he could not spot his\\nbottle on the tables.\\n\\n\"if your sugar is down, you will have a problem in the last\\nmile,\" he said. \"i missed about three or four. if i did not miss\\nthem, i think, i am strong, i would win today.\"\\n\\ngoumri made the move that shook up the race at the halfway mark.\\nwith an unusually large lead pack of about 20 runners, goumri\\ndecided to surge ahead. the burst immediately splintered the pack\\nand formed a new lead pack of about eight.\\n\\nat that point, abdi abdirahman had high hopes of contending for\\nthe title. he was considered the top contender to break the 26-year\\namerican victory drought. abdirahman led for much of the first 10\\nmiles, but when goumri made his move, abdirahman felt a stitch in\\nhis side. he watched the leaders go and could not follow.\\n\\nby the time he felt better, it was mile 17 and he could not\\ncatch up. he moved up from there and finished sixth, the top\\namerican finisher in 2:14:17. behind him, three other americans --\\njosh rohatinsky, jason lehmkuhle and bolota asmerom -- finished in\\nthe top 10, the most since 1987.\\n\\n\"i thought i had a chance of winning if i would have felt\\nbetter,\" abdirahman said. \"if i didn\\'t have a problem with my\\nside stitch, i would have done much better than i did. i think i\\nwould have been up there on the podium.\"\\n\\nthe man at the top of the podium was not such a surprise this\\ntime around. gomes said he trained specifically to handle the hills\\nof the new york course. and even though he is accustomed to heat\\nback home, the cold and wind here does not bother him. he ran most\\nof the race wearing a knit cap.\\n\\nat the end, he warmed himself with a wide smile and was greeted\\nby welcoming cheers. people in new york, as well as brazil, know\\nhim now.\\n\\ngomes said he expected another hero\\'s welcome back in brazil\\n\\n\"probably there will be a parade and a celebration,\" he said.\\n\"but it\\'s going to have to wait a bit because i\\'m planning on\\ngoing on vacation with my wife to disney world.\"\\n\\ngomes laughed. brazil, he figures, will soon laugh with him\\nagain.\\n\\nfor elite runners, marathons are not unlike bank\\naccounts. only so many withdrawals can be made before the body\\nexceeds the available balance of miles, and speed and stamina.\\n\\nat 34, battling recent stress fractures and two olympic\\ndisappointments, paula radcliffe of britain had come to a moment of\\naccounting on sunday -- a victory at the new york city marathon\\nwould signal that her career remained encouragingly solvent at the\\ntop international level, while defeat might indicate that her legs\\nhad reached the overdraft of inevitable decline.\\n\\non a windy, cold morning, radcliffe ran a pitiless race, leading\\nfrom beginning to end over 26.2 miles, hammering the pace, shedding\\nthe rest of the field with four miles remaining and winning in new\\nyork for the third time, in 2 hours 23 minutes 56 seconds.\\n\\nradcliffe won so thoroughly that she finished almost two minutes\\nahead of the next runner and completed the second half of the race\\nnearly three minutes faster than the first half. she did not\\napproach her world record of 2:15:25, but that was not the point\\nwhile running into the hills and into a headwind. victory in new\\nyork is always more important than time.\\n\\nthe victory will give radcliffe leverage when her nike contract\\ncomes up for renewal in january and will let the rest of the\\nworld\\'s top marathoners know that she is serious in her ambition of\\nchallenging for a gold medal at the 2012 london olympics. by then\\nshe will be 38, the same age as the 2008 olympic champion,\\nconstantina tomescu-dita of romania.\\n\\n\"i\\'m sure she can do it,\" tomescu-dita, a spectator on sunday,\\nsaid. \"she was so strong today from beginning to end.\"\\n\\nludmila petrova of russia, the 2000 new york champion, took\\nsecond at age 40 in 2:25:43 and set a world record for a masters\\nage-group runner.\\n\\nkara goucher of the united states, competing in her first\\nmarathon, fought off stomach cramps and took third in 2:25:53, a\\ndebut record for an american woman. deena kastor held the previous\\ndebut mark of 2:26:58, set in 2001. goucher\\'s finish was the best\\nby an american woman in new york since anne marie letko took third\\nin 1994.\\n\\nbeyond sunday\\'s start, radcliffe knifed into the lead on the\\nhumpbacked first mile along the verrazano-narrows bridge, with the\\ntemperature at 41 degrees and a northeast wind blowing at 15 miles\\nan hour. that is her style, assertive, unwavering, no patience for\\nletting others set the pace.\\n\\ndressed in a purple singlet with only a pair of white gloves to\\nprotect against the chilly headwind, radcliffe ran with her\\nfamiliar nodding style. she served as a windbreak for the lead\\npack. petrova, goucher and the other challengers tucked in behind.\\n\\n\"it was tough out there because of the wind,\" radcliffe said.\\n\"everyone seemed to want to run behind me.\"\\n\\nless than three months ago, at the beijing olympics, radcliffe\\nstopped during the race to stretch her aching, cramping legs and\\nfinished a distressed 23rd. she had been unable to train\\nsufficiently after a stress fracture in her left femur in may. this\\nhad come after the huge disappointment at the 2004 athens games,\\nwhere radcliffe did not finish in the oppressive heat and humidity.\\n\\nshe had no such vulnerability on sunday. after reaching the\\nhalfway point in 1:13:23 in a pack of five runners, radcliffe began\\nto escalate the pace. wearing black sleeves to warm her arms,\\ngoucher, 30, seemed comfortable running in radcliffe\\'s slipstream.\\nat least for a time. her return home for her marathon debut bore a\\nsense of the bittersweet. goucher is a native of queens, but she\\nmoved to the midwest at age 4 after her father was killed by a\\ndrunken driver on the harlem river drive.\\n\\nshe won a bronze medal in the 10,000 at the 2007 world track and\\nfield championships and competed in the 5,000 and the 10,000 at the\\nbeijing games, which left goucher entering sunday\\'s marathon with\\nebullient hopes. but hope is not the same as experience.\\n\\non first avenue, radcliffe covered mile 17 in 5:16. one moment,\\ngoucher appeared relaxed, the next she was in trouble. then she\\nfell away, as others had before her, including catherine ndereba,\\nthe 2008 olympic silver medalist, and gete wami, the 2007 new york\\nrunner-up, who lost a chance to win a $500,000 bonus as part of the\\nworld marathon majors competition.\\n\\na year ago, radcliffe did not subdue wami until the final mile.\\nthe suspense ended much earlier sunday.\\n\\nradcliffe began to bob her head more noticeably, as she always\\ndoes, a tic that seems to signify her exertion and determination.\\nby mile 20, only petrova was left to challenge her. radcliffe did\\nnot look back, fearful of stepping in a pothole and of violating\\nher father\\'s assertion that peering at other runners \"is a sign of\\nweakness.\"\\n\\nmercilessly, radcliffe put her foot heavily on the accelerator.\\nshe ran mile 21 in 5:18 and mile 22 in 5:12, striding easily and\\nboldly, while petrova shuffled desperately behind, fading, trying\\nto hold off a renewed goucher for second place. first place had\\nbeen long decided, though victory in new york only highlighted\\nradcliffe\\'s failures at the athens and beijing olympics.\\n\\n\"it does make it frustrating,\" she said. \"you think, \\'why can\\ni get it right in new york and i can\\'t get it right there?\"\\'\\n\\nothers have begun to suggest to radcliffe that she reduce her\\ntraining or her racing in an effort to preserve whatever greatness\\nremains in her legs. so far, she has resisted the advice. sunday\\ndemonstrated why.\\n\\n\"there is a finite number of good marathons in anyone,\"\\nradcliffe said. \"but i do believe that number varies from person\\nto person. you never know until you are kind of on the downside\\nthat you are. so i\\'m grateful for each one and hope it\\'s going to\\nhold.\"\\n\\nbeing a reserve quarterback in the nfl\\nis not all that dissimilar to the role of vice president, brooks\\nbollinger explained after serving the cowboys on sunday as backup\\nto a backup.\\n\\n\"i was trying to get prepared, knowing i\\'m just a snap away,\"\\nbollinger, the onetime jet, said of awaiting an opportunity that\\ncame in the second half while watching brad johnson throw his away\\nin the first.\\n\\nby the end of a 35-14 giants victory, all you could say was that\\njerry jones could have played quarterback for the cowboys,\\nfulfilled a zealous owner\\'s fantasy, and who would have known the\\ndifference from johnson and bollinger?\\n\\nthese were the impotent stand-ins for tony romo in as unsightly\\na giants-cowboys game as it gets, won by the home side in bruising,\\ncruising fashion, largely because dallas was utterly helpless on\\noffense. isn\\'t it amazing when a team with super bowl hopes -- which\\nthese cowboys certainly had but have already downgraded to\\nwild-card prayers -- embarks on its journey without a competent\\nquarterback on the bench?\\n\\nbecause what are the chances of an injury within the airtight\\nsecurity chamber in which the quarterback typically plays?\\n\\n\"it\\'s not all the quarterbacks, obviously,\" wade phillips, the\\ncowboys\\' coach, said after america\\'s team plunged into the basement\\nof the national football conference\\'s east division. phillips did\\nconcede that a 1-3 record without romo and \"going from the\\nthird-best offense in the league to whatever we\\'ve been the past\\nfew games\" -- in a word, bad -- was no endorsement for how the\\ncowboys planned for the season.\\n\\njohnson, 40 and no vinny testaverde, was intercepted twice in\\nthe first half by cornerback corey webster, and both resulted in\\ngiants touchdowns. bollinger relieved johnson to start the third\\nquarter, but his first pass went straight to no. 37 in blue, giants\\nsafety james butler. two play later, brandon jacobs was in the end\\nzone with the giants\\' fourth touchdown and a 28-7 lead. the rest of\\nthe game had all the tension of an august exhibition.\\n\\nromo and his injured pinkie could be two weeks from returning,\\nand because the cowboys (5-4) do not play next week, they naturally\\nwere in no mood to concede anything, least of all their season. the\\nproblem is they weren\\'t all that intimidating before romo was\\ninjured; they have other issues besides injuries; they are in a\\nfiercely competitive division with a difficult schedule; and they\\nhave a coach, phillips, who could conceivably be going bye-bye\\nduring the break, depending on how irritated jones was watching his\\nteam take such a giants stadium beating.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think we\\'ll fall apart, by any means -- this will be a\\ntest of character, a test of will,\" terrell owens said, suddenly a\\ncool-headed leader, which is good news for the cowboys, given the\\npotential alternative, but bad news if that\\'s what it has come to\\nfor a team that might be ready to implode.\\n\\nif the giants taught us anything last season when they\\ntransformed themselves from dysfunctional family to kumbaya kings\\nof the road, it is that team character is a quality that cannot be\\ncreated with the addition of big-name players. it develops over\\ntime, and with commitment and purpose.\\n\\nmaybe jones should have been looking for a legitimate stand-in\\nfor romo instead of working so hard to elevate the cowboys\\' rogue\\nand knucklehead quotient with his ill-fated pursuit of the\\nnow-suspended cornerback adam jones. in case he hasn\\'t noticed,\\nbackup quarterbacks are a crucial commodity -- most notably in\\ntennessee, where the former giants super bowler kerry collins, who\\nbegan the season behind vince young, is at the helm of the league\\'s\\nlast undefeated team.\\n\\nactually, it took tom coughlin and the giants awhile to grasp\\nthis medical math, too. remember when the unaccomplished jared\\nlorenzen, with his charles barkley body type, was one snap away\\nfrom eli manning\\'s position? this season, david carr, a former\\nstarter who is in the prime of his athletic life, provides a major\\nupgrade.\\n\\nfor his part, manning continued to rise sunday with three\\ntouchdown passes, despite an appearance of early eli in the first\\nhalf on successive possessions. he fumbled while attempting a pass\\non the first, but owens was stripped by antonio pierce three plays\\nlater after a reception at the giants\\' 6-yard line.\\n\\nthen manning was intercepted by cornerback mike jenkins, who\\nreturned the pass 23 yards to the end zone. the replay showed that\\nmanning\\'s throw was to the sideline, intended for plaxico burress,\\nwho appeared to run a straight route. tom coughlin chose to blame\\nneither and to credit jenkins.\\n\\ngood as he is, burress remains a headache for the giants\\' coach,\\nalthough coughlin is developing a remedy in the person of receiver\\nsteve smith, an emerging star in an already deep and versatile\\noffense.\\n\\nthis is perhaps the most telling contrast: the giants act and\\nplay like the self-assured defending champions they are; the\\ncowboys have the look of a group that has experienced resounding\\nfrustration at the end of their last two seasons and can sense\\nanother slipping away.\\n\\nit\\'s not over yet. it will be if romo isn\\'t back soon.\\n\\ngov. jim gibbons of nevada has been cleared by the justice\\ndepartment of any wrongdoing in connection with an inquiry into\\nwhether he helped a friend win defense contracts in exchange for\\ngifts, gibbons\\' lawyer said.\\n\\nthe lawyer, abbe d. lowell, said the lead prosecutor in the case\\ninformed gibbons on friday that no charges would be filed and that\\nthe investigation, related to gibbons\\' work as a congressman before\\nhe was elected governor in 2006, had been closed.\\n\\na justice department spokeswoman, laura sweeney, said the\\ndepartment would not comment.\\n\\nlowell said gibbons, a republican whose first term as governor\\nhas been dogged by legal, political and personal troubles, would\\nmake a statement on monday.\\n\\nthe investigation spanned 18 months, lowell said, and began when\\na former staff member of a technology company run by a friend of\\nthe governor made accusations of influence peddling.\\n\\nthe former staff member, dennis montgomery, told news media\\noutlets that his boss, warren trepp, the owner of etreppid\\ntechnologies, had given gibbons money, casino chips and a caribbean\\ncruise to help etreppid win defense department contracts.\\n\\nlowell called the accusations \"ridiculous\" and \"hogwash\" and\\nsaid, \"the governor does not even gamble.\" lowell said gibbons\\nhad cooperated in the investigation and in recent months had been\\ninterviewed by fbi agents.\\n\\nthe investigation, lowell said, might have been slowed by a\\ncivil lawsuit between montgomery and etreppid, which was settled\\nlast month.\\n\\nblxware llc, the company where montgomery works, said the terms\\nof the settlement were confidential, but the company, based in\\nbellevue, wash., disclosed that the agreement included a payment to\\ntrepp as \"compensation for certain allegations\" made against him\\nin the news media.\\n\\nthe closing of the investigation provides welcome news to\\ngibbons in a trying period.\\n\\na former cocktail waitress filed a lawsuit against him last\\nmonth, alleging that he pushed her and threatened to rape her after\\na night of drinking in las vegas just before the november 2006\\nelection. gibbons denied the accusation, and criminal charges were\\nnot filed.\\n\\ngibbons, 63, and his wife, dawn, 54, began divorce proceedings\\nthis year after 22 years of marriage. the news media in nevada have\\nmade much of her accusation of adultery and the disclosure of\\nhundreds of text messages he sent to a woman he has said was a\\nfriend but who dawn gibbons\\' lawyers suggest was a mistress.\\n\\nthe jets spent the first half of their\\nseason talking about what kind of team they could be, talking about\\npotential and possibility and promise.\\n\\nthey knew as well as anyone the way their extreme makeover of an\\noff-season unfolded. the palatial new team headquarters. the trades\\nfor nose tackle kris jenkins and quarterback brett favre. the blank\\ncheck the owner woody johnson cut for general manager mike\\ntannenbaum.\\n\\nall those moves were made for games like the one the jets played\\nsunday. in the division, on the road, against a bills squad that\\nwon the teams\\' previous three meetings, the jets played their most\\ncomplete game this season.\\n\\nthey played like the team they were talking about all along,\\nbeating the bills, 26-17, in front of 71,827 fans, most of whom\\nleft ralph wilson stadium dazed, confused and muttering questions\\nthe home team had no answer for.\\n\\n\"you bring people in, in hopes of what you want to do, to take\\na football team on the road into a hostile environment like this,\"\\njets fullback tony richardson said. \"you come in here expecting to\\nplay well, knowing you can win.\"\\n\\nafter their victory, the jets (5-3) walked off the field without\\nso much as a hint of celebration. some shook hands with the bills,\\nothers stopped to pray near midfield. all walked toward the tunnel\\nwithout the expected screams and without the expected swagger.\\n\\nnever mind that they had just recorded their most important road\\nvictory since 2006, when they beat the patriots in foxborough,\\nmass. never mind that it followed a month of uneven play that had\\ncritics labeling the jets as more pretender than contender. never\\nmind that they had just topped last season\\'s victory total in eight\\ngames. (and never mind that the win, combined with the patriots\\'\\n18-15 loss to the colts on sunday night, moved the jets into a tie\\nfor first place in the american football conference east.)\\n\\nthe jets walked as if they expected this. they talked as if they\\nexpected this.\\n\\n\"it was huge,\" linebacker david bowens said. \"good teams do\\nthat. they finish off a game. they\\'re able to run the ball late.\\nthey\\'re able to make stops.\"\\n\\nthe jets did all of that on sunday.\\n\\ntheir defense, which last forced a turnover on oct. 12,\\nresponded with three takeaways and five sacks. their offense, last\\nseen searching for its identity, moved efficiently throughout.\\ntheir kicker, jay feely, made four field goals.\\n\\n\"it was our best game, as far as everybody coming together and\\ndoing their job,\" linebacker calvin pace said.\\n\\nfavre turned in a game memorable for how unmemorable it was.\\nafter throwing seven interceptions in the three games that preceded\\nthis one, favre stuck with the jets\\' offensive plan, throwing\\npasses short and safe, mixing in the run.\\n\\nof the 28 passes favre threw against the bills, 19 found the\\nhands of his receivers and, most important, only one was caught by\\na bills defender. shedding his wild, gun-slinging ways, he was a\\nmodel of efficiency.\\n\\nmaybe he followed the advice of coach eric mangini, who, using a\\nblackjack analogy last week, told favre not to hit on 20. mangini\\nplayed down their regular tuesday meeting -- \"it wasn\\'t like we had\\na giant summit,\" he said -- but whatever was discussed worked.\\n\\nwhen the jets needed an efficient drive to milk the clock in the\\nfourth quarter, they turned not to favre, whose interception had\\njust been returned for a touchdown, but to their running game.\\n\\nleading by 23-17 with 10 minutes 47 seconds remaining in the\\ngame, the jets followed their running backs downfield. richardson,\\nthe fullback, was one of the new additions, as were linemen alan\\nfaneca and damien woody.\\n\\nby the time feely kicked his fourth field goal, the jets had\\nbled more than eight minutes off the clock. mangini called the\\ndrive critical. the bills needed two scores in about two minutes\\nand got none.\\n\\n\"that was the biggest part of the acquisitions we made in the\\noff-season,\" tight end chris baker said of the run game. \"it\\nhasn\\'t become our identity yet. but it should be, with the guys we\\nbrought in and the guys we have to run the ball.\"\\n\\nthe jets\\' revival on offense was accompanied by one on defense.\\nin their previous three games, the jets struggled to stop the\\nlackluster offenses of the bengals, raiders and chiefs.\\n\\nnot here against the bills. not after allowing a touchdown on\\nthe bills\\' first drive.\\n\\ncornerback darrelle revis, in the middle of a pro bowl-caliber\\nseason, blitzed bills quarterback trent edwards from his blind\\nside. edwards never saw revis coming, and revis stripped the\\nfootball and recovered it.\\n\\nthat play ended up producing three points, but the jets\\' defense\\nwas not done. late in the first quarter, jenkins flattened edwards,\\nand edwards\\' pass floated into the hands of safety abram elam at\\nthe jets\\' 8.\\n\\nelam, who was starting in place of the injured eric smith, took\\noff up the right sideline, slowing before stumbling into the end\\nzone for a 13-7 lead.\\n\\napparently, elam made a similar play during the jets\\' last\\npractice before this game. this one meant a little more.\\n\\n\"it was a big momentum swing,\" elam said.\\n\\nspeaking of big momentum swings, the signing of the 350-pound\\njenkins certainly qualifies. the jets\\' run defense has been their\\nprimary strength this season, and with bills running back marshawn\\nlynch missing long stretches of this game with nausea, they held\\nthe bills to 30 yards on the ground.\\n\\njenkins finished with five tackles, two sacks and three\\nquarterback hits. he was credited with the fourth-down stop of\\nrunning back fred jackson at the jets\\' 8 midway through the second\\nquarter. but his impact stretches, like his waistline, far beyond\\nthe stat sheet.\\n\\nin fact, while mangini called jenkins a \"beast,\" several\\nteammates went further, calling him their most valuable player.\\n\\n\"he\\'s two guys,\" revis said. \"we don\\'t have 11. we have 12.\"\\n\\nlast week, the jets spent the postgame defending their victory\\nover the chiefs, talking again about their unrealized potential.\\n\\nnow, they have their best record at the midway point since 2004.\\nthey are 2-1 in the afc east, 2-0 in the division on the road, on a\\ntwo-game winning streak.\\n\\nthey have built a top-of-the-line run defense, and they have an\\nemerging running game, two key ingredients when the weather turns\\nworse in the coming months. on sunday, the stoic mangini even\\nsmiled.\\n\\ntalking again about potential, safety kerry rhodes stopped the\\nquestion before it finished.\\n\\n\"the team that we can be?\" he said, laughing. \"the team that\\nwe\\'ve been hoping, saying that can show up at any time now? it\\nshowed up today. now, we\\'ve got to keep it going.\"\\n\\nif sen. john mccain defies the polls and wins\\npennsylvania, it will be in part because of voters like harry\\nklemash, 67, a democrat who supported sen. hillary rodham clinton\\nin the primary and is still not comfortable with sen. barack obama.\\n\\n\"obama has too many socialist policies, and he doesn\\'t have\\nenough experience,\" klemash, a retired pressman, said sunday as he\\nwalked his miniature poodle in marconi park in south philadelphia,\\na largely white, catholic, ethnic neighborhood.\\n\\nwith the presidential election a day away, the polls point to an\\nobama victory in pennsylvania, with obama holding a big lead in\\nphiladelphia. but the polls are tightening, and mccain has shown no\\nsigns of letting up in the state.\\n\\nas the republicans try to map situations in which mccain could\\npull off an upset, they are focusing on philadelphia\\'s mostly white\\nenclaves.\\n\\n\"i\\'m spending a lot of time in philadelphia,\" said robert\\ngleason, the chairman of the state republican party.\\n\\n\"we\\'re working the northeast,\" he said, referring to a largely\\nwhite part of the city. \"we\\'ve got values voters up there,\\ncatholics. my people up there say they can carry four to six wards\\nthis year, and four years ago, they carried none.\"\\n\\nwhile wealthier whites in philadelphia, especially in center\\ncity, overwhelmingly support obama, some blue-collar democrats\\nnever made the transition from supporting clinton. in south\\nphiladelphia, mccain signs have cropped up in the windows of the\\nlow brick houses and on the postage-stamp lawns.\\n\\n\"hillary won some of those white wards by 10-1,\" said shanin\\nspecter, son of sen. arlen specter, r-pa., and a lawyer who is\\nsteeped in local politics. \"obama is likely to significantly\\nunderperform kerry and gore in those white row-house wards.\"\\n\\nthe state republican party has begun running advertisements\\nhighlighting obama\\'s ties to the rev. jeremiah a. wright jr., his\\nformer pastor, which could tap into concerns among white voters.\\n\\nthe obama campaign is fully aware of the challenge.\\n\\n\"this is a tough ward,\" said paul rossi, 61, a data processor\\nwho lives in the neighborhood and is helping out at an obama office\\nthat opened saturday not far from marconi park. \"it\\'s a matter of\\nconvincing people culturally that they won\\'t be harmed by obama.\"\\n\\nit is no accident that sen. joe biden, obama\\'s running mate, is\\nbeing dispatched to speak in marconi park on monday night for his\\nfinal rally of the campaign. the white, blue-collar catholics here\\nare just the kind of voters whom biden, also catholic, was chosen\\nto help win over. biden is to be joined by members of the\\nphiladelphia phillies, who just won the world series.\\n\\nsusan streicher, 59, a retired secretary and registered\\ndemocrat, acknowledged that biden\\'s catholicism was appealing to\\nher but said she preferred mccain and gov. sarah palin, mccain\\'s\\nrunning mate, because they oppose abortion rights. her husband,\\njohn, 63, a postal worker, dismissed mccain, saying that he was a\\n\"warmonger\" and that alaska, palin\\'s home state, \"is all\\nwilderness.\" both said they thought obama would win.\\n\\nthere is no doubt that obama, who won philadelphia in the\\nprimary, will again sweep the city, where about 52 percent of\\nvoters are black. but while it is a major part of the statewide\\npuzzle, it is still only a piece.\\n\\nin 2004, sen. john kerry, the democrat, won about 80 percent of\\nthe vote in philadelphia, beating president bush by 412,000 votes\\nhere. but kerry won the state by only 144,000 votes.\\n\\ngov. edward g. rendell of pennsylvania said sunday that although\\nhe still expected obama to win the state, he was \"nervous\" and\\nhad been on the phone \"screaming at chicago,\" meaning the obama\\nheadquarters, to send reinforcements. hillary clinton is due in\\npittsburgh on monday; former president bill clinton is to stump for\\nobama in erie and elsewhere the same day.\\n\\nmccain continues to devote his most precious resource, his time,\\nto pennsylvania. he made three in-person pleas to voters in the\\neastern part of the state over the weekend and planned a final,\\nshort rally for monday at the pittsburgh airport.\\n\\nalthough mccain has paid scant attention to philadelphia,\\ngleason, the republican state chairman, said mccain hoped to do\\nbetter in the city than bush did, and the party has begun running\\nadvertisements highlighting obama\\'s ties to the rev. jeremiah a.\\nwright jr., his former pastor, which could tap into concerns among\\nwhite voters.\\n\\n\"in south philadelphia,\" gleason said, \"with the battle\\nbetween the african-americans and all the other wards, we can keep\\nobama under a 400,000 margin in philadelphia.\" (he added with a\\nlaugh, \"i get a big salary to be positive.\")\\n\\nrendell agreed that because of the white wards, obama might get\\na smaller percentage of the philadelphia vote than kerry did,\\nperhaps 75 percent instead of kerry\\'s 80 percent. but with\\nadditional democratic registrations, he said, and a bigger turnout,\\nobama would exceed kerry\\'s numbers.\\n\\nin addition, rendell said, mccain could not rely on the\\nrepublicans\\' deepest well in the state, which, until 1992, had been\\nthe four suburban counties around philadelphia. rendell and gleason\\nagreed that montgomery county, the most affluent and liberal of the\\nfour, would vote for obama, and that bucks and delaware counties\\nwere also likely to swing for him. the fourth, chester county, is\\nclosely contested.\\n\\nelsewhere in the state, mccain needs a big turnout in central\\npennsylvania and is making an incursion into the scranton area. in\\ncounterpoint to mccain\\'s appeal there to catholic democrats, the\\nobama team on sunday sent in caroline kennedy.\\n\\ndespite the frenzied last-minute campaigning and polls\\nsuggesting a tighter race, g. terry madonna, a political analyst at\\nfranklin &amp;amp; marshall college in lancaster, said he expected obama to\\nwin the state by at least seven points.\\n\\nas part of the obama campaign\\'s highly organized\\nget-out-the-vote operation, scores of volunteers were hustling in\\nand out of the new branch office here on sunday.\\n\\nmany were from out of state, including two women from new york\\nwho said they had expected to be sent to more rural environs and\\nwere surprised when they were sent to philadelphia.\\n\\n\"we thought, oh, it\\'s an urban area, it\\'s done,\" said marian\\nmasone, 57, a film curator who lives in brooklyn.\\n\\nthey said they were also surprised by the negative reaction to\\nthem in south philadelphia. masone and her friend, eileen newman,\\n62, who works in film management and lives in manhattan, said that\\nsome people said \"no way\" to them about obama and that one told\\nthem, \"get off this block.\"\\n\\nas for klemash, the south philadelphia resident, he said he was\\nambivalent about mccain, too. \"mccain is too close to bush,\" he\\nsaid, yet he admires mccain\\'s military service. then again, he\\nsaid, palin was a bad choice as mccain\\'s running mate because she\\ndoes not have enough experience. but then again, he said, obama\\ndoes not have enough experience, either.\\n\\nhis conclusion: \"this is a really hard election.\"\\n\\nthe new york times said in editorials for monday, nov. 3:\\n\\n      lame duck summit meeting\\n\\npresident bush will be the lamest of ducks by nov. 15, when\\nleaders of 20 nations meet in washington to discuss the global\\nfinancial crisis. with only two months left in office, he will not\\nbe around to implement any policy changes he proposes or agrees to.\\n\\nbush\\'s bigger problem is his utter lack of credibility when it\\ncomes to the central question of how to regulate national and\\nglobal financial markets to ensure that this disaster never happens\\nagain. eight years and a huge financial crash later, and bush is\\nstill extolling the corrective powers of unrestrained markets.\\n\\nstill, the meeting could not, and should not, wait until a more\\nopportune time in america\\'s political cycle.\\n\\nwith the world entering a u.s.-led recession, the global\\neconomic powers need to air their concerns and global markets need\\nto see that political leaders are ready to work together to restore\\nstability.\\n\\nwhat this first meeting should not do is try to impose any real\\npolicy changes. with the crisis still unfolding, it\\'s too soon for\\nextensive reforms. philosophical differences are also too deep and\\nwith bush on his way out, the americans are in no position to sign\\nanything.\\n\\nwhen he first proposed a meeting last month, president nicolas\\nsarkozy of france called for everything from the \"moralization of\\nfinancial markets\" to stricter bank supervision and government aid\\nfor national industries. bush emphasized the need to preserve\\n\"free markets, free enterprise and free trade.\"\\n\\nthe two finally agreed that the meeting would \"review\\nprogress\" on settling the crisis and \"seek agreement on\\nprinciples of reform.\" at this point even that is probably too\\nmuch.\\n\\nthe summit meeting could still be useful if the leaders used it\\nto begin a serious discussion about the roots of the financial\\ncrisis and agree to a series of future meetings to discuss\\nsubstantive reforms.\\n\\nthey could start the process by calling for formation of an\\ninternational high-level group of nongovernment experts to analyze\\nthe causes and implications of the crisis. once there is some\\nagreement, another group of experts could lay out a list of\\npotential policy changes. that would give the next president a\\nrunning start.\\n\\nwe congratulate bush for insisting that the invitation list be\\nexpanded beyond the wealthiest industrial nations to include other\\neconomically important ones like china, india, australia and\\nbrazil. they are also being hard hit by the made-in-america crisis,\\nas turmoil in the financial markets weakens economies worldwide,\\nthreatening vital trade. and these countries deserve a voice in any\\nlong-term solution.\\n\\nwe\\'d like to believe that bush, after eight years of disdaining\\ndiplomacy and anything with the word multilateral attached to it,\\nhas finally figured that the united states cannot go it alone.\\n\\ngiven the country the next president will inherit -- heavily\\nindebted, oil-dependent and the source of the prevailing financial\\ncalamity -- he will be in no position to dictate terms to the rest\\nof the world. if the nov. 15 meeting can set the stage for real\\ncollaboration, it will be a success.\\n\\ngouging women on health insurance\\n\\nas tens of thousands of workers lose their jobs -- and their\\ngroup health insurance -- in a worsening economy, they will have to\\nscramble to find affordable insurance policies in the open market.\\nthe problems will be particularly acute for women, who often pay\\nfar higher premiums than men for the same health coverage, if they\\ncan get coverage at all.\\n\\nthe inequities in the health insurance market were described in\\na recent report by the national women\\'s law center and in an\\narticle by robert pear in the times. if women are covered by an\\nemployer\\'s group policy, they are usually protected by federal\\nantidiscrimination laws. the states, however, regulate the market\\nfor individually bought policies, and most offer women few\\nprotections against discrimination. new york is a notable\\nexception.\\n\\nafter checking policies around the country, pear found that\\nwomen can pay hundreds of dollars a year more than men for\\nidentical coverage. the law center\\'s analysis of 3,500 individual\\nhealth insurance plans found that insurers charged 40-year-old\\nwomen anywhere from 4 percent to 48 percent more than they charged\\nmen of the same age.\\n\\nthe study also found that in some states insurers are allowed to\\nreject applicants for reasons that effectively exclude many women,\\nsuch as having had a caesarean section or surviving domestic\\nviolence, and that the vast majority of individual policies don\\'t\\ncover maternity care.\\n\\nthe insurance industry justifies charging higher premiums on\\nactuarial grounds -- that women between the ages of 19 and 55 make\\ngreater use of health care services than do men. women are more\\nlikely to take prescription medications on a regular basis, more\\nlikely to have chronic conditions requiring ongoing treatment, and\\ntheir reproductive health needs require them to get regular\\ncheckups whether or not they have children. that doesn\\'t explain\\nwhy one missouri company charges 40-year-old women 140 percent more\\nthan men; another only 15 percent more.\\n\\ninsurance companies long ago stopped charging premiums based on\\nrace, even though they offered similar actuarial arguments. there\\nare laws against using gender to set rates in employer-based health\\ninsurance. surely it is time to eliminate gender-based premiums in\\nthe individual health insurance market as well. otherwise women,\\nwho typically earn less than men, may find themselves priced out of\\nadequate health coverage.\\n\\nthe soiled envelope, please\\n\\nthere are no awards for the season\\'s slimiest political messages\\n(swift boat statuettes?), but two deserve consideration in the\\ncharacter assassination category.\\n\\nin the first, republicans in pennsylvania flooded 75,000 jewish\\nvoters with an e-mail alarum from a retired jewish judge equating a\\nvote for barack obama with the \"tragic mistake\" of jews who\\nignored the warning signs of the holocaust. quick apologies and\\nretractions were offered once this surfaced in the press, but too\\nlate for the unspeakable to be spiked.\\n\\nin the second, the campaign of sen. elizabeth dole of north\\ncarolina, who is in a very tight race, broadcast her desperation by\\nattacking her opponent, state sen. kay hagan, for accepting\\n\"godless money\" at a \"secret\" fundraiser whose hosts included a\\nleader of a secularist group.\\n\\nat the end, the tv screen fills with a shadowy photo of hagan,\\nan elder at her christian church, as a female voice fairly shrieks:\\n\"there is no god!\"\\n\\nthen there is the fringe madness of \"letter from 2012 in\\nobama\\'s america\" -- an apocalyptic fiction making the rounds from\\nthe conservative christian group focus on the family action. it\\nforesees an obama incumbency marked by terrorist attacks on\\namerican cities, rampant crime as guns are confiscated, a nuclear\\nattack on israel and the boy scouts\\' disbanding to avoid\\ncourt-empowered gay leaders.\\n\\nit seems just another straight-line for jon stewart until the\\nnation remembers that the group\\'s leader is james dobson. he is one\\nof the most prominent leaders on the evangelical right, with an\\naudience measured in the scores of millions.\\n\\nthe democrats have their share of slimy ads, like one targeted\\nat the elderly that falsely claims john mccain would cut social\\nsecurity benefits in half. we\\'re not excusing that ad or any other\\npolicy distortions. but frankly, it\\'s not even an also-ran compared\\nwith what the mccain campaign and its allies have been up to.\\n\\namong the experts, a lot of talk about the military option.\\n\\nit is a frightening notion, but it is not just the trigger-happy\\nbush administration discussing -- if only theoretically -- the\\npossibility of military action to stop iran\\'s nuclear weapons\\nprogram.\\n\\nof course, no president or would-be president ever takes the\\nmilitary option off the table, and barack obama and john mccain are\\nno exception.\\n\\nwhat is significant is that inside washington\\'s policy circles\\nthese days -- in studies, commentaries, meetings, congressional\\nhearings and conferences -- reasonable people from both parties are\\nseriously examining the so-called military option, along with new\\ndiplomatic initiatives.\\n\\none of the most thorough discussions is in a report by the\\nwashington-based bipartisan policy center, founded by four former\\nsenators -- the republicans robert dole and howard baker and\\ndemocrats tom daschle and george mitchell -- to devise policy\\nsolutions both parties might embrace.\\n\\nthe report warns that the next administration \"might have\\nlittle time and fewer options to deal with this threat.\" it\\nexplores such strategies as blockading iran\\'s gasoline imports, but\\nit also says that \"a military strike is a feasible option and must\\nremain a last resort.\"\\n\\nits authors include dennis ross, top mideast adviser to obama,\\nand former sen. dan coats, a mccain adviser.\\n\\nashton carter, a senior pentagon official in the clinton\\nadministration, wrote a paper for the center for a new american\\nsecurity, a prestigious bipartisan think tank, that asserts\\nmilitary action must be seen as only one component of a\\ncomprehensive strategy \"but it is an element of any true option.\"\\n\\nat a conference in september in virginia sponsored by the\\nwashington institute for near east policy, \"surrogates\" for\\nmccain and obama insisted america must focus on preventing iran\\nfrom developing a bomb, not on allowing iran to produce one and\\nthen deterring its use.\\n\\n\"john mccain won\\'t wait until after the fact,\" declared the\\ncolumnist max boot, from the mccain team. the arizona senator has\\npreviously said risking military action may be better than living\\nwith an iranian nuclear weapon (and to his regret jokingly sang a\\nsong about bomb, bomb, bombing iran).\\n\\nrichard danzig, obama\\'s surrogate, said his candidate believes a\\nmilitary attack on iran is a \"terrible\" choice but \"it may be\\nthat in some terrible world we will have to come to grips with such\\na terrible choice.\" early in the primary campaign, obama declared\\nthat as president he would sit down in his first year in office\\nwith -- among others -- iran\\'s president, mahmoud ahmadinejad. (he\\nhas been reparsing that commitment ever since.)\\n\\ngiven the global economic meltdown and other crises, it is not\\nsurprising if the american public is largely unaware of this\\ndiscussion. what makes me nervous, is that\\'s what happened in the\\nrun-up to the iraq war.\\n\\nin those days americans were reeling from the shock of 9/11 and\\ncompletely focused on hunting al-qaida in afghanistan. in\\nwashington, though, talk quickly shifted to the next target -- iraq.\\n\\nbush administration officials drove the discussion, but the\\ncognoscenti were complicit. the question was asked and answered in\\npolicy circles before most americans knew what was happening. would\\nthe united states take on saddam hussein? absolutely.\\n\\nas a diplomatic correspondent for reuters in those days, i feel\\nsome responsibility for not doing more to ensure that the\\ncalamitous decision to invade iraq was more skeptically vetted.\\n\\nthis time the debate is not so one-sided. most experts\\nacknowledge that military action poses big risks and offers no\\nguarantee of destroying iran\\'s nuclear program.\\n\\nboth presidential candidates have also promised new diplomatic\\ninitiatives. mccain talks of tougher sanctions and obama proposes a\\ncomprehensive approach involving sterner penalties, more compelling\\nincentives and direct talks with iran.\\n\\nross, who was top mideast negotiator for the first president\\ngeorge bush and for president bill clinton, said that in the\\nprelude to iraq, nearly all of the talk focused on military action.\\nhe says this time experts are taking a harder, more systematic look\\nat all options -- including force -- because diplomatic efforts have\\nfailed to slow iran\\'s rush to master nuclear technology.\\n\\n\"i want to concentrate the mind and make people understand,\\n\\'look, this is serious and you don\\'t want to be left with only\\nthose two choices\"\\' -- war or living with an iranian bomb, he said.\\n\\nwith iran projected to produce enough fuel for a nuclear weapon\\nby 2010, the next president is going to have to concentrate his\\nmind quickly. we hope he, unlike george w. bush, will encourage a\\nbroader public debate about all of america\\'s options, and the high\\ncost of another war. i will certainly be a lot more skeptical.\\n\\nmilton katselas, an iconoclastic acting teacher whose 30 years\\nin hollywood raised him to guru status in the eyes of hundreds of\\nactors, many of them famous, died in los angeles on oct. 24. he was\\n75 and lived in los

-- stanislavski, adler, strasberg --\\nkatselas was a pragmatist who declared himself open to any and all\\nacting theories if they got results. and he was a realist who\\nwanted audience members to recognize the humanity of the people\\nthey saw being portrayed.\\n\\n\"he said it was important for the butcher to be able watch a\\nperformance of a butcher onstage and say, \\'that\\'s how i do it,\"\\'\\ngrossman said.\\n\\nkatselas earned the loyalties of generations of students with\\nkeen observations not of the characters they played but of their\\nown characters, openly challenging his acting students to face\\ntheir own weaknesses and problems so that they could better face\\nthose of the people they played.\\n\\nhis saturday morning master class for professional actors was a\\nhigh-caliber hollywood salon. his students over the years --\\nincluding alec baldwin, james cromwell, burt reynolds, john glover,\\ngeorge clooney, kate hudson, patrick swayze and tyne daly --\\nremained deeply loyal, partly because the criticism katselas\\noffered was specific and pointed and partly because he spoke not\\nonly about the craft but also about the profession of the actor,\\noffering ideas on audition preparation and role selection, among\\nother obsessions of career-minded actors.\\n\\n\"he would use what you are, what was right in front of him,\\ntweak that,\" joan van ark, the television and stage actress, said\\nin a phone interview on friday. \"and what he said on saturday\\nalmost always served you the next tuesday.\"\\n\\ndoris roberts, best known for her role as ray romano\\'s mother on\\nthe long-running television series \"everybody loves raymond,\"\\nsaid she first met katselas 45 years ago, when both were students\\nat the actors

you hate about\\nthis business?\\' and i said, \\'arrogance.\\' he said: \\'you don\\'t have\\nany. you need some.\"\\'\\n\\nbefore opening his school, katselas had a successful career as a\\nstage and film director. in 1960 he directed the american premiere,\\noff broadway, of \"the zoo story,\" the play that announced the\\narrival of the playwright edward albee. nine years later, he was\\nnominated for a tony for directing \"butterflies are free,\" a\\npsychedelic-era romance between a blind man (keir dullea) and the\\nflower child (blythe danner) who lives in the next-door apartment.\\nhe went to hollywood to direct the film, an early vehicle for\\ngoldie hawn, and directed \"40 carats\" with liv ullmann in 1973.\\n\\nin 1983, katselas was hired to direct a broadway revival of noel\\ncoward\\'s \"private lives,\" but, never a shrinking violet, he was\\nfired during out-of-town tryouts when he couldn\\'t get along with\\none of the stars, elizabeth taylor. he had no problem, he said,\\nwith her co-star -- yes, richard burton.\\n\\n\"i got along great with burton,\" he said last year in an\\ninterview with the new york times magazine, \"and he told me i

of cultism hung\\nover the school.\\n\\nkatselas admitted that he had suggested that half a dozen\\nstudents over the years look into the church (just as he admitted\\nto romantic liaisons with

said. at his death,\\ncotel, who was ordained five years ago, was spiritual leader of\\ntemple beth el of manhattan beach in brooklyn.\\n\\n\"my religion changed from judaism to classical music, and in\\nadulthood it changed back again,\" cotel told the newspaper jewish\\nweek last march.\\n\\nperforming or conducting his own works or those of others around\\nthe world, cotel was known for a career that arched from early\\nromantic compositions to atonal, unpredictable avante-gardist\\nscores and then to a reversion to romanticism.\\n\\n\"that morris cotel is a composer-pianist of unusual\\ncapabilities seems beyond question,\" allen hughes wrote in the new\\nyork times in 1977, adding that his playing built \"to climaxes of\\nabsolutely torrential fury.\" morris was cotel\\'s birth name.\\n\\namong his notable compositions are \"deronda,\" an opera based\\non george eliot\\'s novel \"daniel deronda,\" about an english jew\\nwho is a proto-zionist with kabbalistic ideas; and \"trope for\\norchestra,\" a choral work that evokes torah cantillation, or\\nchanting. his cantata \"the fire and the mountains\" memorializes\\nthe holocaust.\\n\\nnot all of cotel\\'s works were connected to jewish themes. his\\n\"night of the murdered poets\" incorporated writings of poets and\\nintellectuals murdered in the stalinist pogrom of 1952. it had its\\npremiere in new york in 1978 with the actor richard dreyfuss as\\nnarrator, and was performed around the country in subsequent years.\\n\\nan epiphany for the composer came in 1994, nine years after the\\npremiere of \"dreyfus,\" a two-act opera. it was based on the\\ntreason conviction in 1894 of alfred dreyfus, a jewish officer in\\nthe french army whose trial exposed deep-rooted anti-semitism in\\nfrance. opera news praised it as \"compelling in its traditional\\nlyricism and new-wave originality.\"\\n\\nperformances of \"dreyfus\" were scheduled for germany and\\naustria in the early 1990s. to improve his german, the composer\\nfound a tutor, an old german widow living in upper manhattan. after\\nreturning from europe, he spotted the woman on the street. she\\ngreeted him in hebrew and told him that she had been so inspired by\\nhis telling of the dreyfus story that she had returned to judaism,\\nan identity she had forsaken since the nazi onslaught.\\n\\n\"my life changed right then and there; it was like a voice came\\ndown into my head: \\'become a rabbi,\"\\' cotel told the juilliard\\njournal in september. \"without knowing it, i had changed this\\nwoman\\'s life, and she had no idea that she had just changed mine.\"\\n\\nsince 1972, cotel had been a professor of music composition at\\nthe peabody conservatory of johns hopkins university in baltimore.\\nsoon after the encounter with the woman, he enrolled part time at\\nthe academy for jewish religion in the bronx. in 2000, he retired\\nfrom peabody, where by then he was chairman of the composition\\ndepartment, to focus full time on his rabbinical studies. he was\\nordained three years later.\\n\\ncotel never turned from music. his most recent compositions\\ninclude \"chronicles: a jewish life and the classical

can\\ndefine a young quarterback.\\n\\nbut it\\'s hard to find much fault with the performance turned in\\nby patriots\\nquarterback matt cassel last night.\\n\\ncassel completed 25 of 34 passes for 204 yards with no\\ntouchdowns and one\\ninterception as new england fell to the indianapolis colts, 18-15,\\nat lucas\\noil stadium.\\n\\nthe numbers don\\'t tell the story of a quarterback who looked\\npoised and\\nconfident while battling another afc power in a hostile\\nenvironment. if you\\nsquinted hard enough, you might have thought no. 12 was under\\ncenter for\\nthe patriots.\\n\\nand this was a night the patriots desperately needed a leader on\\noffense.\\nthe patriots wanted to keep peyton manning and the colts\\' offense\\non the\\nsideline as long as possible, and cassel put together numerous\\nsustained\\ndrives.\\n\\nhis only fault was he couldn\\'t turn those drives into\\ntouchdowns, but he\\nshouldn\\'t shoulder all the blame for that.\\n\\njabar gaffney dropped what looked to be a sure touchdown pass\\nlate in the\\nthird quarter. the patriots settled for the last of stephen\\ngostkowski\\'s\\nthree field goals, tying the game at 15 early in the fourth\\nquarter.\\n\\nthose were the last points the patriots scored.\\n\\ngaffney took the blame in the locker room, sitting in a chair\\nand softly\\ntelling reporters over and over again, \"i just dropped the ball.\"\\n\\nbut in an interview room around the corner, cassel wasn\\'t\\nwilling to pin\\nthe loss on a single play or player.\\n\\n\"i just told him to keep his head up,\" said cassel. \"jabar\\nmakes that\\nplay all the time.\"\\n\\ncassel admitted he didn\\'t see how close the pass was to being\\ncaught (a\\nperfect 39-yard lob down the left sideline with gaffney wide open\\nas the\\ncolts converged on randy moss in the slot).\\n\\nbut cassel did know how close the patriots came to winning,\\nwhich left a\\nbad taste in his mouth.\\n\\n\"it\\'s tough to take,\" said cassel. \"we played a tight game\\nand lost by 3\\npoints. you take your hat off to the colts. we have to regroup and\\nget\\nready for next week.\"\\n\\nwhen the sting of letting a winnable road game slip away wears\\noff, the\\npatriots should look back fondly on the performance of cassel and\\nthe\\noffense.\\n\\nin only the seventh start of his pro career, cassel stood in the\\npocket\\nwith confidence and didn\\'t take a single sack, despite facing one\\nof the\\nleague\\'s fiercest pass rushes.\\n\\nhe rushed five times, scrambling early in the game to avoid\\npressure, but\\notherwise stood in the pocket and delivered his passes with poise.\\nin\\ntypical cassel fashion, he praised the offensive line for its play.\\n\"the\\noffensive line really stepped up tonight,\" said cassel.\\n\\nin the locker room, his teammates were offering the same praise\\nin return.\\n\\ncoach bill belichick wouldn\\'t directly compliment his\\nquarterback, choosing\\nto speak in generalities about cassel\\'s performance.\\n\\n\"i thought overall we played a good football game, but came up\\na couple\\nplays short,\" said belichick. \"i thought we played very well in\\nall areas\\nand just came up a few plays short.\"\\n\\ncassel would admit as much. while he thrived putting together\\nlengthy\\ndrives (the patriots ran 67 plays to the colts\\' 50), he struggled\\nto get\\nhis team into the end zone.\\n\\nthe lone touchdown drive came on the first possession of the\\nsecond half,\\na 15-play, 72-yard march culminating on a 6-yard run by benjarvus\\ngreen-ellis.\\n\\ncassel converted three first downs on the drive, scrambling for\\none and\\nfinding moss and wes welker for two others.\\n\\nbut he couldn\\'t produce the same magic in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nafter an unnecessary roughness penalty on david thomas that\\npushed the\\npatriots out of field goal range with less than five minutes to\\nplay,\\ncassel was intercepted by bob sanders on a desperation heave to\\nbenjamin\\nwatson on fourth and 15 from the indianapolis 45. the patriots got\\nthe ball\\nback at their 20 with 21 seconds to play, but didn\\'t cross\\nmidfield.\\n\\n\"from one week to the next, you just try to continue to get\\nbetter,\" said\\ncassel. \"you see different looks and you become more comfortable\\nwith your\\nteammates. that\\'s where i\\'m at right now.\"\\n\\nhe didn\\'t make the leap. but if last night was any indication,\\nit could be\\ncoming soon.\\n\\nchris forsberg can be reached at cforsberg@boston.com.\\n\\npatriots come up empty-handed against desperate colts\\n\\nindianapolis - time was on the patriots\\' side for much of last\\nnight\\'s\\ncontest with the indianapolis colts, but in the end time ran out -\\nboth on\\ntheir clock-killing game plan and on their penalty-free play.\\n\\ndespite rising to the occasion in yet another patriots-colts\\nclassic, new\\nengland (5-3) went home with an 18-15 loss last night in front of\\n66,508\\nfans at lucas oil stadium, dropping them into a three-way tie for\\nfirst\\nplace in the afc east with the new york jets and buffalo bills, who\\nvisit\\nfoxborough this sunday.\\n\\nwithout quarterback tom brady and safety rodney harrison, with\\njust three\\nhealthy running backs and an inexperienced and injury-saddled\\nsecondary,\\nthe patriots decided their best defense was a clock-killing,\\npossessive\\noffense. they limited indianapolis to just seven possessions for\\nthe game,\\nheld a 34:24 to 25:36 advantage in time of possession, and held the\\ncolts\\nto just 18 points.\\n\\nthe plan worked until the very end when an untimely drop, an\\nill-timed\\npenalty, a lack of timeouts, and a timely clutch kick by former\\npatriots\\nkicker adam vinatieri had the patriots fall back behind the colts.\\n\\n\"i thought we had our chances,\" said new england coach bill\\nbelichick.\\n\"we\\'ve just got to do a little more with them.\"\\n\\nafter stephen gostkowski booted his third field goal of the game\\nwith 11:33\\nremaining to tie it, 15-15, the colts got the ball back and drove\\nfrom\\ntheir 18 to the patriots 34. vinatieri then connected on a 52-yard\\nfield\\ngoal with 8:05 remaining to give the colts an 18-15 lead.\\n\\nmatt cassel, who acquitted himself quite well in his matchup\\nagainst peyton\\nmanning, going 25 of 34 for 204 yards, got the ball at his 19 with\\n7:59\\nleft and moved the patriots to the colts 32, where they had a\\nsecond and 2.\\nbut tight end david thomas committed a 15-yard unnecessary\\nroughness\\npenalty, blocking colts defender robert mathis in the back after\\nthe\\nwhistle, on a 1-yard run by rookie benjarvus green-ellis (15\\ncarries for 57\\nyards and a touchdown).\\n\\nsuddenly the patriots, who had no timeouts, were out of field\\ngoal range\\nand facing third and 16.\\n\\nwith the indianapolis wide receivers as open as the retractable\\nroof at\\npeyton\\'s new place most of the night, belichick elected to go for\\nit on\\nfourth and 15 with 4:40 to play and cassel was intercepted by\\nsafety bob\\nsanders at the indianapolis 25.\\n\\n\"i was just trying to make a block and i never heard a whistle\\nand it was\\na critical mistake and it really cost us,\" said thomas.\\n\\nthomas wasn\\'t the only one who made questionable judgment calls\\nin the\\nsecond half. on the patriots\\' 15-play drive to tie the game at 15,\\nbelichick called a timeout, rethinking his decision to go for it on\\nfourth\\nand 1, from the indianapolis 7. the play was executed prior to the\\nwhistle\\nand cassel picked up the first down on a sneak, but the timeout\\nnegated it\\nand the patriots, who had no timeouts with 11:38 to go in the game,\\nhad to\\nsettle for a field goal.\\n\\nbelichick said he didn\\'t get a good look at the placement of the\\nball and\\nthought that it was fourth and inches when it was closer to a yard.\\n\\n\"i thought it was too long for a quarterback sneak,\" he said.\\n\\nhowever, it never would have come to that point if wide receiver\\njabar\\ngaffney, who was wide open, had not dropped a would-be 39-yard\\ntouchdown\\npass at the 6-yard line earlier in the drive.\\n\\n\"i dropped it,\" said gaffney. \"he made a good throw. i\\ndropped it. i\\ndon\\'t make any excuses. it hit my hands. i should have caught it.\"\\n\\nthe patriots had taken a 12-7 lead on the opening drive of the\\nsecond half,\\nan impressive 15-play, 72-yard march that was capped by a 6-yard td\\nrun by\\ngreen-ellis.\\n\\nbut the drive - and the decisions made on it - proved costly in\\nthe long\\nrun\\n\\nnew england had to squander a timeout on the drive and lost\\nanother one\\nwhen belichick, on first and 10 from the indy 45, chose to issue a\\nvideo\\nreplay challenge of an illegal substitution flag against the colts\\nthat was\\npicked up by the officials. he lost the challenge.\\n\\ntrailing, 7-6, at the half, belichick said he had made up his\\nmind that if\\nhis team scored he was going for the 2-point conversion. but the\\ncolts\\nstuffed running back kevin faulk inches short of the goal line.\\n\\nthe colts wasted no time retaking the lead, four minutes to be\\nexact, as\\nmanning (21 of 29 for 254 yards and 2 tds) capped a nine-play,\\n57-yard\\ndrive with his second td toss of the game to anthony gonzalez, a\\n9-yarder.\\nthe colts also went for 2 and manning threaded a pass to reggie\\nwayne to\\ngive indy a 15-12 lead with 3:12 left in the third quarter.\\n\\nthe patriots\\' strategy was to take the air out of the ball and\\naway from\\nthe colts offense. all of new england\\'s scoring drives were 13\\nplays or\\nlonger and the shortest lasted 6:18.\\n\\nit was well-executed, but it just wasn\\'t enough.\\n\\n\"as potent of an offense as manning and those guys, to keep the\\nball away\\nfrom them it\\'s basically like playing defense in itself,\" said\\npatriots\\ncornerback ellis hobbs.\\n\\n\"so, the offense, they did their job for the most part. defense\\ndid their\\njob for the most part.\\n\\n\"but as a whole we didn\\'t do it enough because we didn\\'t win.\"\\n\\nchristopher l. gasper can be reached at cgasper@globe.com.\\n\\nindianapolis - as the years have gone by - adam vinatieri has\\nnot been a\\npatriot since the 2005 season - there has developed a general\\nfeeling that\\nthe best kicker the patriots ever had isn\\'t quite what he used to\\nbe,\\nespecially as the length of attempted field goals increases.\\n\\nnot all share that opinion.\\n\\n\"he\\'s longer than he used to be,\" stated hunter smith, his\\nholder for\\nthe colts.\\n\\nsmith\\'s point was proven dramatically when vinatieri boomed a\\n52-yarder in\\nthe fourth quarter that provided the colts with the winning points\\nin an\\n18-15 victory over the patriots last night.\\n\\nvinatieri, of course, had two super bowl-winning kicks for the\\npatriots.\\nbut after the 2005 season, he signed with the colts as a free agent\\nand the\\npatriots moved on with stephen gostkowski. vinatieri continued his\\nmagical\\npostseason career, making three field goals as the colts beat the\\nbears in\\nthe super bowl following the 2006 season.\\n\\nstill, he\\'s been in the league for 13 years and there does exist\\na school\\nof thought that he doesn\\'t have the range he once had. in fact, he\\nhadn\\'t\\nmade a field goal of 50 yards or longer in the regular season since\\n2002.\\n\\n\"really?\" said vinatieri, sounding surprised. \"well, it\\'s\\nnice to know\\ni still have some lead left in the pencil.\"\\n\\nwith the game tied, 15-15, the colts moved from their 18-yard\\nline, but\\nthen faced a fourth-and-7 from the patriots\\' 34. it was either play\\nthe\\nposition game with a short punt or let vinatieri try a 52-yarder.\\nbut the\\npatriots had put together four time-consuming drives.\\n\\nthere was no hesitation on the sideline, according to vinatieri\\nand smith.\\n\\n\"there\\'s a right time and a wrong time to try ones that long\\nand this was\\nclearly the right time,\" said vinatieri. \"both stephen and i were\\nhitting\\nthem from 55 yards out during warm-ups. we were booming the ball\\nout\\nthere.\"\\n\\n\"i hit it pretty well. it definitely left my foot feeling\\npretty good.\"\\n\\nin fact, it cleared the goal post easily.\\n\\n\"truth be told, it would have been good from 15 yards\\nfurther,\" said\\nsmith, who also noted that the snap and hold went perfectly.\\n\\nthere may be some future 50-plus-yarders in vinatieri\\'s future\\nbecause the\\nnew lucas oil stadium seems to be kicker friendly. besides\\nvinatieri\\'s\\nfield goal, the patriots\\' chris hanson had a 64-yard punt and smith\\naveraged 54.3 yards from three punts.\\n\\nthe roof was open in the stadium, but the 244-foot wide by\\n88-foot tall\\nwindow was closed on the north end of the stadium. the window was\\nat\\nvinatieri\\'s back when he kicked the winning field goal, though he\\ndidn\\'t\\nthink the window had any effect.\\n\\nthe patriots never said that vinatieri\\'s best days were behind\\nhim when he\\nleft for indianapolis and vinatieri expresses no outward bitterness\\ntoward\\nhis old team.\\n\\n\"we just needed a victory,\" he said. \"we need to get back on\\nthe\\nwinning side. we had two straight losses and we needed to find a\\nway to get\\na win. you couldn\\'t call it a must win, but it sure was\\nimportant.\"\\n\\nthe colts are now 4-4 and the patriots are 5-3. both teams are\\nused to\\nbeing playoff locks but they might have to make the playoffs as a\\nwild card\\nthis season. that\\'s especially true of the colts, who trail\\nundefeated\\ntennessee by four games in the afc south.\\n\\n\"even without tom ((brady)) out there, they still have a great\\nteam,\"\\nsaid vinatieri of the patriots. \"((matt)) cassel manages the team\\nvery\\nwell.\"\\n\\njoe sullivan can be reached at jtsullivan@globe.com.\\n\\nindianapolis - great games come in different forms. some are\\nshootouts.\\nsome are defensive struggles.\\n\\nbut the entertaining, thrilling game the patriots and colts\\nplayed last\\nnight fell into a different category - it was possession-based,\\nfilled with\\nlong drives, played with a razor-thin margin for error.\\n\\nthe patriots needed to go that route if they were to win, mainly\\nbecause\\ntheir pass defense was a bad matchup against peyton manning and co.\\n\\nit turns out the colts, also minus key players in the secondary,\\nneeded to\\ngo the same route because they feared receivers randy moss and wes\\nwelker.\\n\\n\"it was really a field-position game and both teams were really\\nworking\\nthe clock a lot, and i think that\\'s mutual respect from both\\nteams,\" said\\ncolts kicker adam vinatieri, whose 52-yard field goal turned out to\\nbe the\\ndifference in the 18-15 victory.\\n\\n\"you try to keep their offense off the field because both teams\\nhave a lot\\nof explosive firepower that can put points on the board,\" said\\nvinatieri.\\n\"it seemed like it was real methodical drives that were taking\\nsix, seven,\\neight minutes. it just made each possession that much more\\nimportant and\\nyou had to capitalize on every one of them.\"\\n\\nin the end, both teams had just seven drives, and in games like\\nthat,\\ncoaches and players from both sides agreed that it\\'s the team that\\nmakes\\nthe plays in critical situations that comes out on top.\\n\\nand that\\'s where the separation ultimately came into play, with\\nthe\\npatriots hurt by a dropped would-be touchdown by jabar gaffney in\\nthe third\\nquarter, and a devastating personal foul penalty on tight end david\\nthomas\\nthat knocked the team out of range for a tying field goal in the\\nfourth.\\n\\nit also hurt that the patriots were out of timeouts, the result\\nof a failed\\nchallenge in the third quarter in which bill belichick felt the\\ncolts had\\n12 men on the field, another timeout taken later in that drive, and\\nthen a\\nfinal timeout burned early in the fourth quarter on a fourth-and-1.\\n\\nwith both teams vulnerable on defense, they adopted conservative\\nplans.\\ncolts receiver reggie wayne and tight end dallas clark said the\\npatriots\\nwere playing cover-2, keeping their two safeties in the deep part\\nof the\\nfield to take away the big play. so the colts adjusted and found\\nsuccess in\\nthe real estate in front of those safeties.\\n\\nthe same was true with the colts\\' defensive approach, as they\\nwere without\\nstarting cornerbacks marlin jackson (injured reserve) and kelvin\\nhayden.\\n\\n\"it was a tough matchup on us,\" said indianapolis coach tony\\ndungy. \"we\\nplayed some double coverage on ((wes)) welker and then they went to\\n((randy)) moss. we didn\\'t want to single ((moss)) all that often,\\nand give\\nhim a chance to make big plays, so we played a lot of zone. then\\nthey threw\\nthe ball underneath, and they had some good runs ((on)) us.\\n\\n\"it was one of those ((games)) where we did all we could on\\ndefense, and\\ndid keep them from having the big plays.\"\\n\\nsaid patriots quarterback matt cassel: \"you have to take what\\nthey give\\nyou. in this type of ballgame, it comes down to one possession, and\\nthey\\nwere able to get that last possession at the end of the game and we\\nweren\\'t\\nable to counter that. we had the penalty late, and that hurt us.\\nthat makes\\nthe difference.\"\\n\\nin possession-style games, third down and red zone loom large.\\nthe colts\\nwere 6 of 10 on third down, while the patriots were a solid 8 of\\n14. the\\ndifference came in the red zone, where the colts cashed in on both\\nof their\\ntrips with touchdowns, while the patriots could punch it in just\\nonce in\\nfour tries. that helps explain how the patriots, who had drives of\\n13, 13,\\n15, 15, and 8 plays, could have a commanding time of possession\\nedge\\n(34:24-25:36) and still lose.\\n\\nthe game was played in a tidy 2 hours, 41 minutes, tied for the\\npatriots\\'\\nquickest of the year.\\n\\n\"you really kind of figure that\\'s how it\\'s going to be with\\nthese guys,\\nbecause they do a great job of possessing the ball and of time\\nmanagement,\" said clark. \"we were scoring touchdowns when we got\\ninto the\\nred zone, and they were getting field goals, and i thought that was\\nthe big\\npart of the game.\"\\n\\n\"we knew it would come down to the last possession,\" patriots\\nlinebacker\\nadalius thomas said. \"that\\'s pretty much what it came down to.\"\\n\\nmike reiss can be reached at mreiss@globe.com.\\n\\nindianapolis - the game plan was masterful, pure bill belichick\\ngenius.\\n\\nthe execution was something else, and in the end, belichick\\nheard more\\nhard questions than grady little.\\n\\nthe colts beat the patriots, 18-15, at lucas oil (can boyd)\\nstadium last\\nnight and as always, the ponies and pats thrilled america with 60\\nminutes\\nof bone-rattling, action-packed football. the patriots came within\\na couple\\nof plays (a jabar gaffney drop and a david thomas penalty) of\\nwinning the\\ngame and still managed to come home with a share of first place in\\nthe afc\\neast scramble.\\n\\nit took a 52-yard field goal from adam vinatieri (you may have\\nheard of\\nhim) to beat new england, and in the midnight hour belichick was\\ngrilled\\nabout going for a 2-point conversion in the middle of the third\\nquarter,\\ncalling a timeout that appeared to negate a first down on fourth\\nand 1\\nfrom the colts\\' 7 (new england settled for a field goal), and\\nelecting to\\ngo for it on fourth and 15 from the colts\\' 45 with 4:40 left.\\n\\nbelichick also had an unsuccessful challenge in the second half\\nand burned\\nhis final timeout with 11:38 left to play. mercy.\\n\\nmr. hoodie has answers for all of the above, but it\\'s difficult\\nto\\nremember a game that turned on so many debatable decisions by the\\nvaunted\\nnew england coach. all of them blew up in his face. and that\\'s\\nunusual.\\n\\nit was odd to see the coach on the hot seat after a game in\\nwhich his\\nmaster plan was particularly brilliant. the patriots knew the colts\\nwere\\nfaster and more experienced. new england\\'s defense had four rookies\\non the\\nfield for most of the snaps. the climate was ripe for a peyton\\nmanning\\nhighlight reel and the patriots knew they were in trouble.\\n\\nso what did belichick do? he shortened the game. he played stall\\nball. he\\nhad matt cassel throwing a succession of short passes. he ran kevin\\nfaulk\\non draw plays. he tried a few direct snaps to faulk.\\n\\ncassel carried out his orders nicely. qb 16 was never sacked,\\ngained 20\\nyards on five carries, and completed 25 of 34 passes. cassel\\nwatched\\nwith the rest of us when the game slipped through the fingers of\\ngaffney on\\nwhat would have been a 39-yard touchdown pass at the end of the\\nthird\\nquarter.\\n\\nhad the patriots won this game, they would have been in sole\\npossession of\\nfirst place in the afc east. instead, they are tied with the bills\\nand jets\\nwith a 5-3 record. they play both at gillette stadium in the next\\nweek and\\na half.\\n\\n\"the colts made a couple of more plays than we did,\" said\\nbelichick.\\n\"we had our chances, disappointing, but we have some pretty good\\ngames\\ncoming up, a game against buffalo and we are going to turn our\\nsights\\ntoward that.\"\\n\\nplaying on national television, in front of 66,508 people at\\nspectacular\\nlucas oil stadium, the patriots did a masterful job most of the\\nway.\\nbelichick\\'s goal was to keep manning off the field and new england\\nwon the\\ntime-of-possession scorecard, 34:24-25:36.\\n\\nit was the patriots\\' first game in the colts\\' new building,\\nwhich will be\\nthe home of the 2012 super bowl. named after forrest lucas, a\\ntruck-driving man who founded one of the country\\'s largest\\nproducers of\\nautomotive lubricants, lucas oil is well known on the nascar\\ncircuit.\\nstadium officials opened the retractable roof more than two hours\\nbefore\\nkickoff.\\n\\nthere were only seven offensive possessions in the first half,\\nwhich ended\\nwith the colts leading, 7-6.\\n\\non indy\\'s second possession, manning led the colts 91 yards on\\n15 plays\\nover nine minutes, connecting with anthony gonzalez on a 12-yard\\ntouchdown\\npass. dr. manning was 8 for 8 (69 yards) on the drive. nothing\\nclose to a\\nmiss. the colts did not lose yardage on any play in the drive.\\n\\nthe patriots answered with a pair of drives that produced field\\ngoals,\\nboth lasting more than six minutes. new england\\'s burn-clock\\nstrategy on\\noffense was obvious. cassel, untouched by the colts\\' speed rushers,\\nrarely\\neven looked to his wide receivers. he was 8 for 9 in the first\\nhalf, but\\nthe completions totaled only 64 yards.\\n\\nnew england\\'s plan continued at the start of the second half\\nwhen the\\npatriots ate up almost eight minutes and took the lead on a 6-yard\\nrun by\\nbenjarvus green-ellis. new england went for 2, but faulk came up\\nshort.\\n\\nfolks at lucas oil scratched their heads. this was ridiculous.\\nthe\\nbattered patriots, somehow, had the lead.\\n\\nthe colts roared back, though, with an easy touchdown drive to\\nregain the\\nlead. then came the gaffney drop. it was bad, people. the perfectly\\nthrown\\nball went through his hands as he crossed the 5-yard line. for good\\nmeasure\\nit fell to his feet and he booted it low and hard. the patriots\\nsettled for\\na tying field goal - after losing what appeared to be a first down\\non a\\nquarterback keeper because time had been called from the sideline.\\nouch.\\n\\nafter vinatieri\\'s 52-yarder, the patriots drove right back into\\nfield-goal\\nrange and looked set to tie the game and shoot for overtime.\\ngreen-ellis\\ncarried to the colt 31 on a second-and-2 play, and that\\'s when\\nthomas was\\ntagged for unnecessary roughness on a late block.\\n\\nout of timeouts, afraid to give the ball back with 4:40 left,\\nbelichick\\nhad cassel throw deep on fourth and 15 from the colts\\' 45. bob\\nsanders\\nintercepted. in the words of tony kornheiser, \"good night,\\ncanada.\"\\n\\nweird night for belichick. the plan worked. a

diocese of southwest florida this week.\\njefferts schori, who leads more than 2.4-million episcopalians\\nworldwide and 34,000 in the bay area, is coming to tampa for the\\nbiannual meeting of the national association of episcopal schools.\\nit\\'s her first visit as presiding bishop.  we talked with her\\nfriday as she prepared for her trip.\\n\\nwhat\\'s the state of the episcopal church?\\n\\nmost every place i visit, congregations and dioceses are\\nenergetically engaged in serving their neighbors both nearby and\\nfar away. what gets reported in the media is a matter of a\\nrelatively few people who are exceedingly unhappy and very noisy.\\n\\nyou\\'ve been in office for almost two years. describe the\\nlandscape of the church.\\n\\nin some sense, i think we\\'re past the worst of the current\\ncontroversies. i think most people are realizing that there are a\\nvariety of opinions in this church about the current hot-button\\nissues as there have always been a variety of opinions about\\nmatters of great interest in the church. i\\'m fond of reminding\\npeople that in the late 1800s people were arguing vehemently about\\nwhether or not you could put candles on the altar. significant\\nnumbers of people left the church over that issue. the current\\ncontroversy is not new in its heat. what is new is the speed with\\nwhich it\\'s communicated around the world. but i think as\\nepiscopalians we\\'re remembering that we value a diversity of\\nopinion, and that\\'s part of our health and part of our dna.\\n\\nare you any closer to resolving the controversial issues, which\\ninclude disagreements over the ordination of gay priests?\\n\\ni\\'m not sure these issues are ever going to be fully resolved. i\\nthink it\\'s a matter of learning to live in the tension of not\\nmoving completely in one direction or the other. that\\'s what\\nanglicans are good at and have been good at through our history.\\n\\nmany people view the episcopal church as one of the most liberal\\ndenominations in the united states. how do you feel about that\\ncharacterization?\\n\\ni don\\'t think that\\'s accurate. we\\'re actually very conservative\\nin our liturgical tradition. we worship in ways that are very much\\nlike the ways the early christian communities worshiped. we\\'re\\nconservative in the sense that we retain the best of what comes\\nfrom the past. and we\\'re progressive in the sense that we think our\\njob is, in every generation, to present the gospel in language and\\nimages that can be understood by new generations.\\n\\nwhat would you say to individuals who might be considering\\nleaving the denomination?\\n\\ni would remind them that their voice and their gifts are welcome\\nand needed in this church and that we lament their going if they\\ndecide they need to go. at the same time, if they decide they need\\nto pursue their spiritual journey in another place, we pray all the\\nbest for them.\\n\\nwhy did the denomination feel the need to apologize recently for\\nits historical role in the institution of slavery?\\n\\nthe proximate cause was a resolution passed at our last general\\nconvention in 2006 asking the church to formally apologize for its\\nparticipation in the sin of slavery. we did that in a formal way on\\noct. 4. my hope is that service is the first of many services that\\nwill happen in local dioceses and in congregations as people begin\\nto discover the history of their communities over the last several\\nhundred years. how they\\'ve participated in slavery, how they\\'ve\\nbenefited from slavery, how they continue to benefit from injustice\\nin this country.\\n\\nwhat have you learned about yourself since you\\'ve been in\\noffice?\\n\\ni\\'ve learned that i keep on learning. every day presents\\nopportunities for discovering in greater depth what it means to be\\na messenger of good news in this world.\\n\\nhow would you characterize your time in office?\\n\\nbusy and full. and a great delight and a great joy to see the\\nchurch engaged in mission in all its varied parts and contexts.\\n\\nwhat does a bishop do for fun?\\n      i like to go mountain climbing, backpacking and flying.\\n      sherri day can be reached at sdaysptimes.com or (813) 226-3405.\\n\\n      .      fast facts\\n      visit to

the state elections division.\\n\\nabout 37 percent of the 11.2-million registered voters, or\\n4.2-million, had cast ballots. nearly 2.6-million of those votes\\nwere cast at early voting locations. the rest were submitted via\\nabsentee ballot, nearly 1.7-million.\\n\\nmany who waited in long lines sunday saw this as their last\\nchance to vote. while it\\'s true that the polls are open for

the\\nflorida division of elections.\\n\\nin pinellas county, many of the 3,000 people who voted sunday\\nwere angry about long lines. some criticized the county elections\\nsupervisor, deborah clark, for opening only three early voting\\nsites, the minimum required by law. (hillsborough county had 13\\nsites. pasco had seven.)\\n\\nclark, a republican, said sunday that it was difficult to find\\nsites with enough space and parking, and that she hopes to see the\\nlegislature allocate more funding to early voting. she says her\\noffice\\'s aggressive absentee ballot campaign is more cost-effective\\nand easier for voters because they can vote at home.\\n\\npinellas had 43,226 early voters and 160,039 absentee voters\\nthrough saturday  far fewer early voters and far more absentee\\nvoters than hillsborough or pasco counties.\\n\\ndemocrats are more likely to visit early voting sites;\\nrepublicans are more likely to vote via absentee. the result:\\n331,000 more florida democrats than republicans had cast ballots as\\nof

polls?\\n\\nvalid ids include a florida driver\\'s license or an id card\\nissued by the state; a u.s. passport; a debit or credit card with\\nyour picture on it; a military id; a student id; a retirement\\ncenter id card; a neighborhood association identification, and a\\npublic assistance id. if your id does not include both your photo\\nand your signature, you need to bring in something with your\\nsignature on it. if you fail to bring any id, you might be required\\nto cast a provisional ballot, and then it\\'s up to the canvassing\\nboard to decide if your vote counts.\\n\\ncan i vote anywhere there\\'s a polling place?\\n\\nno. you have to vote in the precinct where you\\'re registered. if\\nyou don\\'t know where that is, contact your county elections\\nsupervisor (see contact information inside).\\n\\ni was sent an absentee ballot but i didn\\'t use it. can i still\\nvote in person?\\n\\nyes, but you should take your blank absentee ballot with you and\\nturn it in. otherwise you could be required to cast a provisional\\nballot, so the canvassing board can make sure you\\'re not trying to\\nvote twice.\\n\\nis it too late to mail my absentee ballot?\\n\\nno. ballots postmarked on tuesday will count. you can also\\nreturn it in person to the county elections supervisor\\'s office by\\n7 p.m. tuesday.\\n\\ncan i wear a button or a t-shirt supporting my candidate?\\n\\nyes. but you are not allowed to actively campaign inside the\\npolling place, so let your shirt or pin do your talking for you .\\n\\ncan i bring my children with me to the polls?\\n\\nyes. but you\\'d be a smart parent to bring them something to keep\\nthem entertained during the wait .\\n\\nmy mother has a disability. can i help her vote?\\n\\nyes. a disabled voter can bring someone into the booth for\\nassistance. ask a poll worker if there\\'s a form you need to fill\\nout first. a voter can also ask the poll workers for help. and each\\nprecinct will have a touchscreen machine as an option for disabled\\nvoters.\\n\\nif i am still waiting in line to vote when the polls close at 7\\np.m., will i be turned away?\\n\\ngenerally, poll workers allow anyone in line at closing to vote,\\nas long as you\\'re willing to keep waiting.\\n\\nwill we get election results tuesday night?\\n\\nif we do, they will be unofficial . election officials count\\nabsentee ballots first, then it\\'s a matter of how fast the\\ncomputers in 67 counties can tabulate the results from all the\\noptical scans. official results are days away, as the state\\nconsiders any absentee ballot mailed by tuesday to be part of the\\ntally. plus, counties have two days to consider whether to count\\neach provisional ballot cast on election day.\\n\\n.      fast

preachers.\\nhis is a broad-shouldered presence on the pulpit. his flowing\\nbaritone requires no microphone. he has a poet\\'s sense of rhythm,\\nof accelerating passion and crescendo. the pastor of beulah baptist\\ninstitutional church, tampa\\'s oldest black baptist house of\\nworship, preaches the red off the devil.\\n\\nhe is preaching to a group of black tampa pastors about hiv. he\\nis laying out his vision for prevention, to be realized by tampa\\'s\\nblack churches. he wants screening, counseling, family assistance.\\nthe pastors feed him quiet yeses and amens.\\n\\n\"for a long time, churches have pushed aids to the side. we put\\nour heads in the sand.\"\\n\\namen to that.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not here, not in our churches. then we found members of\\nour congregations dying. how could we treat them? we didn\\'t even\\nwant to shake their hands.\"\\n\\namen to that, too, pastor favorite.\\n\\n\"how do we bring into our teaching the use of condoms? we\\nbelieve abstinence is the answer, but there are those who will not\\nlisten. we have to tell them that the least they can do is use a\\ncondom.\"\\n\\npastor favorite gets polite silence.\\n\\nin tampa\\'s black neighborhoods, the statistics scream: black\\nfamily disease. more blacks have hiv than any other ethnic group.\\none in 85 blacks in hillsborough county is infected. that is more\\nthan four times the rate for whites. the disparity is more\\npronounced among women. one in every 92 black women in\\nhillsborough is infected. that is 11 times the rate for white\\nwomen.\\n\\nthis black family disease  that\\'s what favorite calls it  preys\\non even fathers and mothers in the pews, children in sunday school.\\n\\nhe wants the full gamut of services for his vulnerable\\ncongregation, and he wants it based in his landmark church, one\\nfounded in 1865 for freed slaves. he wants a partnership with the\\nhealth department similar to one initiated by florida\\'s black ame\\nchurches. ame\\'s florida bishop has committed to providing a church\\nfor hiv screening in every county. they\\'re halfway to their goal.\\n\\nbut pastors whose beliefs are biblically founded get caught in a\\nmoral paradox. if they base an hiv prevention program on abstinence\\nalone, they\\'re bound to fail. if they provide the common medically\\nrecommended option  condoms  they\\'ve compromised their principles.\\nreligion has never been about options.\\n\\none church in miami resolved the paradox by leaving condoms in a\\ngarbage can outside the church. rev. favorite isn\\'t about to build\\nan hiv outreach program for tampa\\'s black families on garbage cans.\\n\\nto understand the silence favorite must contend with, talk to\\nabe brown.\\n\\nno one need educate abe brown on the devastation of aids in\\ntampa\\'s black communities. no one need convince abe brown that\\nreligion and medicine pose a powerful partnership against the\\ndisease.\\n\\nramrod straight at 81, the retired senior pastor of first\\nbaptist church of college hill is the unbending oak staff of\\ntampa\\'s black religious community. he is favorite\\'s mentor and\\nfounder of pastors on patrol, a street ministry that favorite now\\nleads. brown has seen hiv face-to-face, on his patrols, in his\\nprison ministry, among ex-inmates, and among wives and babies.\\n\\nhe has seen it in the church pews. \"we don\\'t require physicals\\nof people who come to church,\" he says. \"we don\\'t turn away\\npeople who come to church for help.\"\\n\\nso abe brown supports whatever hiv intervention program favorite\\ncomes up with. if favorite wants to include condoms, that\\'s his\\ndecision.\\n\\nbut brown can\\'t quite let it go at that. he frowns, struggles\\njust to say the word condom. it\\'s not a word he has ever used in\\nhis ministry.\\n\\nbrown was once known famously as mean dean brown  the\\ndisciplinary dean at chamberlain high school. he likes to tell how\\nhe patrolled the parking lot, looking for cars that took up two\\nspaces. he wrote down the tag numbers and traced the owners,\\nsummoned them to his office. they gaped at him, asked how he\\ntracked them down.\\n\\n\"that\\'s my secret.\"\\n\\nhis personal feelings about hiv are not that different. you park\\nyour car right, in one space. you live right, you sleep in one bed.\\n\\nbrown will not criticize favorite\\'s hiv strategy, but the mean\\ndean brown in him can\\'t bring himself to find any good in the word\\ncondom. it\\'s another way to sin safely, a cheap detour past the\\nhard road to salvation. it\\'s two parking spaces.\\n\\n\"from the pulpit, we teach abstinence. the bible says, \\'don\\'t\\ndo it.\\'?\"\\n\\nto understand the need for the churches\\' blessing, talk to the\\nrev. jerry nealy. he is an associate pastor at the tiny wood-frame\\nfriendly missionary baptist church on central avenue. he teaches\\nsunday school. he is a member of favorite\\'s pastors on patrol. but\\nby now, his name should have been better known in tampa. he should\\nhave been a star in the naacp.\\n\\nhe broke the color barrier at chamberlain high. he found the\\nlord when he was 20. ralph abernathy offered him a job with the\\nsouthern christian leadership conference in atlanta and helped him\\nget into morehouse college. he came back to tampa to work for the\\nnaacp.\\n\\nin 1988, he got hiv.\\n\\nhe doesn\\'t want to spell out how. all anyone needs to know is\\n\"i got baggage.\" he lost his job, his name and his home. he kept\\nhis infection a secret for six years.\\n\\n\"i was no magic johnson. i didn\\'t want anyone to know. what\\nwould people say? there was a taboo in the black churches. there\\nwas no compassion.\"\\n\\nnealy stopped hiding in 1994, obtaining the medicines that have\\nsaved his life. now 57, he advocates for openness through the\\nminority aids council in tampa. he would like the words hiv and\\ncondoms to be everyday conversation, \"at the dinner table, over\\nthe coffee table.\" he\\'ll talk about his own infection, his own\\ndownfall, if he thinks it will help anyone.\\n\\nstill, he lives in alternate worlds. the faith and church he\\nfollows point toward abstinence. his own hard experience points\\ntoward choices.\\n\\n\"if they won\\'t accept a spiritual medicine,\" he says, \"in the\\ninterest of life, let\\'s offer an alternative.\"\\n\\nto understand how hard it is to commit to the long haul, talk to\\nthe rev. bernard smith. he calls himself the \"total pioneer, the\\nlone eagle\" of hiv outreach. for more than six years, smith has\\noffered hiv testing at greene chapel ame church in largo. his was\\nthe first in pinellas.\\n\\nhe has formed partnerships with the pinellas county health\\ndepartment, the state, and the giant hiv-testing company abbott\\nlaboratories. together, they launched a pilot screening program at\\nsix tampa bay ame churches. people came in, got their mouths\\nswabbed. the swabs were sent off for state testing. those who\\ntested positive received counseling for \"life after hiv.\"\\n\\nthe pilot ended on aug. 31. smith called it a big success. but\\nit\\'s over. his volunteers still swab for hiv three times a week at\\ngreene chapel, but no longer have the sponsorship that paid for\\nfood and supplies. smith would like to move the screening to a\\nseparate building. he has been turned down for bank loans.\\ncontinuity of support has always been iffy.\\n\\nsmith has now put almost 20 years in hiv prevention. \"where do\\nwe go from here?\"\\n\\neven he has a problem saying the word \"condom.\" \"we believe\\nin abstinence,\" he says.\\n\\nhas smith ever placed a condom in someone\\'s hands?\\n\\nhe pauses for several seconds.\\n\\n\"we don\\'t advertise them,\" he says. \"our no. 1 focus is\\nabstinence.\"\\n\\nbut has he ever put a condom in a person\\'s hand?\\n      he pauses again.\\n      \"we serve the saved and the unsaved.\"\\n\\nto understand the possibilities of biblical reconciliation, talk\\nto favorite. he leads his deacons through the oakhurst square\\napartments behind beulah baptist on a saturday morning. once a\\nmonth, the deacons knock on doors throughout the downtown tampa\\nneighborhoods. they\\'re not just selling salvation. they\\'re urging\\npeople to come to the church on wednesdays when a nurse offers\\nbasic health screenings. they find every kind of medical need\\nimaginable among those who answer their knock.\\n\\nfavorite grew up on a louisiana plantation. he studied teaching\\nat southern louisiana university. where he grew up, the only\\nsuccessful blacks he knew were schoolteachers. if favorite had ever\\nmet a black medical doctor as a child, he is certain he would have\\nstudied medicine instead.\\n\\none of his friends at beulah baptist is dr. emile commedore,\\ndirector of florida\\'s office of minority health. when favorite\\npreaches hiv prevention to fellow pastors, commedore has his back.\\nhe stresses the public health aspects of aids, and the innocence of\\nmany of its victims  including wives and children. \"condoms are no\\nmore than a means to an end,\" the doctor tells the preachers.\\n\\nfavorite is willing to debate hiv from a biblical perspective.\\nhe is a serious student of the bible, as well as its hebrew and\\ngreek roots.\\n\\nhe often refers to 1 john, chapter 2, verse 1: if any man sins,\\nwe have an advocate with the father.\\n\\nhere in the humble oakhurst square apartments, words like that\\nresonate. there are many sinners. even they have an advocate.\\n\\nthere\\'s a greek word in the new testament that also resonates\\nwith favorite. metanoia. because of its complexity, favorite likes\\nto apply it to his vision for hiv outreach.\\n\\nin its biblical context, the word means repentance.\\n\\nin classical greek, metanoia has another meaning. it means to\\nchange one\\'s mind, to change one\\'s heart.\\n\\njohn barry can be reached at jbarrysptimes.com or (727)\\n892-2258.\\n\\nto donate\\n\\ndonations to the rev. bernard smith\\'s hiv screening program may\\nbe sent to the greene chapel

scrutinized the deal more\\nclosely, he doesn\\'t think he\\'s the only one at fault. he has sued\\nregions bank, accusing it of predatory lending.\\n\\n\"we\\'re looking for restitution in the seven figures,\" said\\njesse ray wagoner, an attorney in tampa representing rivett. \"i\\nthink they really targeted dean. they trapped him in a loan that\\nalmost guaranteed he\\'d lose his house.\"\\n\\nthere are dozens of cases across the state where homeowners are\\nstriking back at lenders, said april charney, a consumer lawyer at\\njacksonville area legal aid. most get settled out of court, making\\nit harder to use the misdeeds  whether by the homeowner or lender\\nas a lesson to others.\\n\\nbut assigning blame isn\\'t always productive, she said.\\n\\n\"when you\\'re in a m..a..s..h unit doing triage every day, do you\\nreally want to look back and say, \\'who put this hole in this\\nperson?\\'?\" charney said. \"you just want to fix it.\"\\n\\nrivett\\'s lawsuit specifically targets two bank employees,\\nnicolas rodriquez and steve kriegbaum, who he says befriended him\\nover several months before offering to refinance his home.\\n\\nrodriquez and kriegbaum declined to comment for this story,\\nreferring questions to a bank attorney who did not return repeated\\ncalls.\\n\\nrivett said he met rodriquez, branch manager and vice president\\nof regions bank at 14965 n. florida ave., in early 2007 when the\\nbanker came into rivett\\'s private investigations office to market\\nbusiness accounts. rivett opened one.\\n\\nrivett says rodriquez would take him to lunch, out for drinks\\nand to sporting events. he said he grew comfortable enough with\\nrodriquez to share personal problems, including a growing addiction\\nto painkillers that he started taking after a car crash in 2004.\\n\\naround that time the economy was slowing down, rivett recalled.\\nthat, combined with his addiction, was taking a toll on his\\nbusiness. his credit card debt was building; his cash flow was not.\\n\\nrodriquez told rivett re-financing could help and the bank was\\noffering a great deal. rivett\\'s home, which he purchased in 2002\\nfor a little more than $200,000, had built equity.\\n\\non june 12, 2007, over chinese food at lunch, rivett signed a\\nstack of documents for a $430,000 loan at a 9.2 percent fixed\\ninterest rate. it wasn\\'t great, but the $30,000 cash he\\'d receive\\nat the end would allow him to pay off debt and market his business.\\n\\na closer look at the documents, provided by rivett\\'s attorney,\\nrevealed problems:\\n\\naccording to the hillsborough property appraiser, rivett\\'s home\\nwas worth $233,874. plus, the application prepared by rodriquez did\\nnot list rivett\\'s daughter as a dependent.\\n\\nwhen asked now if the inconsistencies gave him pause, rivett\\nconfides: \"truthfully, i didn\\'t read it. i just signed. i thought,\\n\\'i can get my life back on track, he\\'s going to save me.\\'?\"\\n\\nby june 20, 2007, regions bank had denied rivett\\'s loan,\\naccording to paperwork given to rivett\\'s attorney. rivett said he\\nwasn\\'t immediately told about the denial.\\n\\ninstead, rodriquez and kriegbaum, assistant vice president of\\nthe regions bank and mortgage at 13902 n. dale mabry, asked to meet\\nwith rivett for lunch.\\n\\nall was well with the loan, rivett said they told him.\\n\\non june 22, 2007, a new appraisal valued rivett\\'s house at\\n$460,000, according to paperwork submitted by the bank.\\n\\na few weeks later, rivett was asked to provide information about\\nhis business, including the number of clients.\\n\\n\"at the time i told him i had about 500 clients,\" rivett said,\\nrecalling a phone conversation with kriegbaum. \"he goes, \\'hey, put\\nit up to like 5,000; it\\'ll look better to the underwriters.\\'?\"\\n\\nthat was only one of several red flags.\\n\\nat the july 25, 2007, closing, rivett and his wife, debbie,\\nnoticed her name had been removed from the loan because of her\\ncredit score, yet her income was still listed.\\n\\nat the time, kriegbaum told them that regions denied the loan so\\nthey had to go through a new out-of-state bank to get it, rivett\\nsaid. the new loan had a 10.7 percent adjustable interest rate.\\nrivett\\'s payments would go from $3,345 for the first three years to\\n$3,832 for the next 26 years, with a $282,000 balloon payment at\\nthe end.\\n\\ndebbie rivett was angry: \"i said, \\'this is ridiculous.\\'?\"\\n\\nkriegbaum tried to ease their apprehension, she said.\\n\\n\"he said, \\'i know all this seems kind of fast and real high,\"\\ndebbie rivett recalled. \"but  this will put money in your bank\\nright now, and we\\'ll turn around and refinance in a couple\\nmonths.\"\\n\\na few days later, when rivett went to pick up his $50,000 check\\nthe cash increased during the deal  he wasn\\'t empty-handed. he had\\nstopped to buy three bottles of crown royal for kriegbaum and a\\n$300 watch for rodriquez. earlier, both men had requested the\\nthank-you gifts for helping rivett out of his jam, rivett said.\\n\\nby the time the first payment arrived, rodriquez and kriegbaum\\nhad stopped calling, rivett said.\\n\\nthe money lasted less than a year.\\n\\nin april, rivett had a heart attack because of his drug use.\\nafter a stint in rehab helped clear his mind, he said he decided to\\nsell the home and go after the bank.\\n\\nby then he was a month behind on his mortgage and citibank owned\\nhis loan. the bank allowed rivett to sell his home for about\\n$277,656  a loss for the bank of about $136,000  because of his\\nhealth problems, he said.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not just losing your house,\" he said. \"it\\'s these\\npeople you thought were

close enough for\\na desperation pass .  if texas had scored , it would\\'ve tied it at\\n39, and an extra point would\\'ve won the game. so shouldn\\'t leach\\nhave gone for two to give texas tech a 40-33 lead? best line\\n\\nas texas tech was roughing up no.??1 texas on saturday night,\\nabc\\'s brent musburger said, \"it\\'s november, folks. here comes bcs\\nchaos. just when you think you\\'ve got it figured out, the ghosts\\nappear.\"\\n\\nforgotten rivalry?\\n\\noklahoma and nebraska played saturday night. time was, that was\\nright up there with ohio state-michigan as the game of the year in\\ncollege football. true, the game was nationally televised on espn,\\nbut it was on while the country (minus sooners and huskers fans)\\nwas tuned in to texas-texas tech. how strange is it that\\noklahoma-nebraska wasn\\'t even the best game in that conference on\\nthat day, let alone the game of the year?\\n\\nkansas city, mo.  after watching his team fall behind by 21\\npoints in the second quarter, matt bryant never dreamed the\\ngreatest comeback in bucs history would come down to his right\\nfoot. but it did  actually three times within a matter of seconds\\nin overtime  and the seventh-year pro out of baylor made it count\\nwhen it finally mattered. his 34-yard field goal with 4:36 elapsed\\nin overtime gave tampa bay an improbable 30-27 victory over the\\nchiefs.\\n\\nbryant\\'s first attempt of 37 yards sailed through the uprights,\\nbut not before kansas city called a timeout  forcing a rekick on\\nthird and 5 from the 20.\\n\\nhis next attempt fluttered wide right . but that effort didn\\'t\\ncount either, thanks to a false-start penalty against bucs tackle\\njeremy trueblood. facing third and 10 from the 25, the offense went\\nback on the field, and quarterback jeff garcia hit fullback jameel\\ncook for 9 yards, setting the stage for bryant\\'s winner.\\n\\nbryant, 33, spoke about the emotional roller-coaster:\\n\\nwhat was going through your mind after the missed field goal?\\n\\njust to have a short memory. the wind was doing goofy things in\\nthat stadium. it was swirling and all of a sudden on that one kick,\\nit kind of straightened out. it went right when it should have come\\nback left. you block it out and go to your next kick  and here we\\nare.\\n\\ncan it be helpful to have some practice kicks before the real\\none?\\n\\nkind of. but each kick is different, no matter how far it is or\\nwhat the situation is. at least we try to approach it that way.\\n\\nwhat did this win mean for the team?\\n\\nit\\'s great. it would have been terrible to go into the bye week\\nwith a loss. but to win the way we did, i think it\\'s just going to\\nmake us hungrier for when we get back from the bye week.\\n\\ndid you think it would come down to a field goal at 24-3?\\n\\nyou never know, but at 24-3, probably not. i wouldn\\'t have bet\\nthat.\\n\\nwhen you won the toss in overtime, how did you feel about your\\nchances?\\n\\nclifton smith was doing a great job all day giving us excellent\\nfield position. so from the very beginning, you know you\\'re going\\nto have a legit shot. and jeff (garcia) has done this many times,\\nleading the offense down there. it was a total team effort to be\\ndown by that many and to hold them and keep scoring.\\n\\nkansas city, mo.\\n\\nike hilliard held his face in his hands after dressing slowly at\\nhis locker at arrowhead stadium until there was no denying how the\\ntopsy-turvy afternoon had taken its toll on the bucs\\' 32-year-old\\nreceiver.  he already had pulled on his slacks, shirt and vest for\\nthe flight home to tampa. according to hilliard, all that was\\nmissing from his suit was a straightjacket.  \"i\\'m too old for\\nthis,\" he said. \"unreal. they\\'re making my life very interesting.\\nthat\\'s the very best i can say. they\\'re allowing me to have a lot\\nof fun. it was crazy. crazy.\"  relief, mixed with disbelief, was\\nthe prevailing sentiment of bucs players and coaches after their\\nhistoric 30-27 overtime victory over the chiefs on sunday.  after\\nwatching his team fall behind 24-3 in the first half only to\\noutscore kansas city 27-3 from there and record the biggest\\ncomeback win in franchise history, hilliard put it into perspective\\nheading into the bye week.\\n\\n\"bye week or no bye week, you look at our team and how we\\'ve\\nbeen able to play and the talk that we had all week about avenging\\n(the dallas) loss,\" hilliard said. \"to come out and play so\\npoorly, we have to look at what we\\'ve done and regroup to a man and\\nfigure out how to not be so flat  coming out on the road against a\\nteam we should\\'ve beat and put away.\\n\\n\"that\\'s no disrespect to the chiefs. we felt we had a chance to\\ngo out and make a statement after a tough loss on the road. on the\\nother hand  unreal in terms of the resiliency that these guys\\nshowed.\"\\n\\nnowhere was that more apparent than in the final two drives\\ndirected by jeff garcia, whose 24-yard touchdown pass to antonio\\nbryant and two-point conversion bullet to alex smith tied it with\\n19 seconds left in regulation.\\n\\ngarcia kept the football away from the chiefs in overtime,\\nhitting michael clayton for 29 yards on the first play to help set\\nup matt bryant\\'s 34-yard field goal.\\n\\nit was an improbable finish for the bucs, who committed four\\nturnovers (three fumbles and an interception) against a team that\\nentered 1-6. two fumbles came in the red zone, where tampa bay has\\nscored 13 touchdowns among 37 trips this season, including 2-of-6\\non sunday.\\n\\nall last week, the bucs stewed over their failures at dallas,\\nwhen garcia failed to launch a pass into the end zone in four tries\\non the final drive of a 13-9 loss.\\n\\nthis time, trailing 27-19 and facing a first and 15 at the\\nkansas city 24, garcia took his shot against a cover 2 defense.\\n\\nhe noticed the chiefs safeties had been cheating to the middle\\nof the field, making it hard to help their cornerbacks over the\\ntop. so he dropped a perfect pass over the head of cornerback\\nmaurice leggett, and bryant made a tremendous catch while\\ntightroping the sideline in the end zone.\\n\\n\"the protection up front gave me the time,\" garcia said;\\n\"gave me the lane to step up and basically look inside to hold\\ndefenders and put a ball where  it got over the corner\\'s reach and\\ngave antonio a chance to make a play.\"\\n\\ngarcia finished 31-of-43 for 339 yards, one touchdown and one\\ninterception. he spread the ball around to nine receivers. but his\\nfavorite target was bryant, who hauled in a team-high eight catches\\nfor 115 yards and the touchdown.\\n\\nsmith\\'s sliding catch of the two-point conversion, which\\nresulted in a sprained right ankle, came on a play they had worked\\non during practice for several weeks.\\n\\n\"there was a whole lot going on, and you just want to secure it\\nand hold on tight for dear life,\" smith said.\\n\\nthe bucs, who at 6-3 sit a half-game behind the idle panthers\\nfor first in the nfc south, won the coin toss to start overtime.\\nthen clayton stayed alive for a scrambling garcia and managed to\\nkeep his feet after a short reception and turned it upfield,\\ngetting a good block from tight end jerramy stevens.\\n\\n\"huge play by michael,\" garcia said. \"the guy is a physical\\nreceiver. he made some clutch catches all day long, but that was\\nthe biggest catch he made in this game.\"\\n\\nthe comeback, however, would not have been possible if not for\\ntwo plays, clifton smith\\'s franchise-record 97-yard kickoff return\\nfor a touchdown late in the first half and the forced fumble and\\nrecovery by safety tanard jackson in the fourth quarter.\\n\\njackson\\'s play came one snap after clifton smith, this time in\\nat running back, fumbled at the chiefs 10. on the bucs\\' first play\\nafter their recovery at the 3, earnest graham completed a halfback\\noption pass to alex smith to cut the chiefs\\' lead to 24-19 (the\\ntwo-point conversion failed).\\n\\n\"we made a play. that\\'s the difference in this league,\" bucs\\ncoach jon gruden said. \"sometimes, guys make great plays. and\\nsometimes, the other team makes them. we had a dramatic victory in\\nchicago (on sept. 21), much like this. and we had a dramatic\\nvictory (sunday) for us; close, hard-fought losses three other\\ntimes.\\n\\n\"that\\'s why you spend so much time working on the two-minute\\ndrill. and boy, did our guys play extremely well when we got into\\nthat phase of our offense.\"\\n\\nbucs\\' biggest comeback wins\\n      date      opponent      deficit      score\\n      sunday      at chiefs      21 (24-3)

have come this season, including 27-24 over the\\nbears on sept. 21.\\n\\nit\\'s not likely anyone will suggest bucs rb earnest graham\\nshould be playing quarterback after the first touchdown pass of his\\ncareer sunday, but the play was big nonetheless.  graham found te\\nalex smith for a 3-yard touchdown on a halfback pass in the fourth\\nquarter, the fruition of weeks of flirting with the idea of using\\nthe play.  \"we tried it out a little bit earlier in the season but\\nnever called it,\" smith said. \"we put it in (the game plan) this\\nweek because we thought we had a good chance for it. it was a great\\ncall and a great throw by earnest.  he said he couldn\\'t really see\\nme, so he just put it in the vicinity. fortunately, the defense bit\\npretty hard.\"  said graham: \"it worked out just like we thought.\\nwe have a million plays; we\\'ve just never used that one.\"  the\\ncall was indeed a savvy one. the bucs had just created a turnover\\nwith s tanard jackson\\'s strip and recovery, and the bucs had first\\nand goal at the chiefs 3. it looked like a run all the way.  \"they\\nwere going hard after the run,\" smith said. \"we could see they\\nwere digging their cleats in there.\"\\n\\ndepending on how you look at it, sunday\\'s victory by the bucs\\nmade jon gruden the team\\'s all-time winningest coach  or it tied\\nhim with tony dungy. if you include postseason victories, gruden\\ntakes the lead with 57 (54 in the regular season and three in the\\npostseason  all during tampa bay\\'s super bowl run after the 2002\\nseason). if you just count the regular season, gruden is tied with\\ndungy at 54 (dungy has two postseason wins). john mckay is third on\\nthe all-time list with 45 wins in 1976-1984. in his seventh season\\nwith the bucs, gruden has won three division titles, the most in\\nteam history, and led the team to its only super bowl\\nchampionship.\\n\\nit\\'s hard to say what was more remarkable about clifton smith\\'s\\n97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter. was\\nit the feat itself, which featured smith darting through traffic\\nwith abandon, or was it the timing?  for coach jon gruden, the\\nanswer was unequivocal.  \"right then, we were struggling,\" he\\nsaid. \"it was a hot day, and it was not going well. that gave us a\\nchance. clifton gave us a chance and gave us some life and some\\nenergy.\"  facing a seemingly insurmountable 24-3 deficit and the\\noffense floundering, the bucs needed a pick-me-up. they got more\\nthan that with the franchise\\'s second kickoff-return touchdown,\\nthis one clearly swaying momentum.  the rookie free agent from\\nfresno state wasn\\'t on the active roster until last week, when it\\nwas decided he would be promoted from the practice squad and\\nsupplant second-round pick dexter jackson (inactive sunday) as the\\nreturn man.  boy, does that move look permanent now.\\n\\nnot so fast\\n\\n. bucs cb phillip buchanon, below, nearly made one of the game\\'s\\nbiggest plays when he intercepted chiefs qb tyler thigpen and raced\\n42 yards to the chiefs 3-yard line in the fourth quarter. the bucs\\nappeared poised to score the go-ahead touchdown. but ss sabby\\npiscitelli was called for illegal contact against te tony gonzalez\\nbefore the change of possession. the timing of the infraction\\nnegated the play, and the chiefs kept possession. an interesting\\nthing: the conversation between buchanon and tanard jackson before\\nthe play. \"(jackson) said to me, \\'hey, one of us is going to make\\na play here,\\'?\" buchanon said. \"i was thinking hopefully it would\\nbe me. i made the play, but it got called back. i guess he was\\nright for both of us.\" jackson had a forced fumble and recovery\\nearlier that set up a touchdown.\\n\\nkeep him clean\\n\\n. for the fourth time this season, the bucs didn\\'t allow a sack.\\nsunday\\'s achievement was notable because qb jeff garcia attempted\\n43 passes in an

(i follow common\\nusage in dispensing with the adverb wholly because of confusion\\nwith its homonym holy.)\\n\\ni ran the traps, as the hunters say, on the emphasis shift in\\nthis phrase with my favorite etymological sources and got a series\\nof shrugs and eye rolls because the phrase as written rather than\\nspoken is too commonplace. but joe pickett, editor at the american\\nheritage dictionary, tracked down an early usage of the shifted\\nstress in a violent song by the heavy-metal band korn titled\\n\"let\\'s do this now\" and noted that \"it\\'s the\\ndoing that is stressed, not the thing itself. and while it\\nanticipates future action, the expression functions as a\\nclincher.\"\\n\\nthat was the meaning picked up by television advertising\\ncopywriters in scenes dramatizing creative work in boardrooms: an\\nexecutive asks for ideas, fixes on one tossed out by a low-paid\\nminion, stands up and snaps to his colleagues with the voice of\\nauthority, \"let\\'s do this!\"\\n\\nwe saw it during the late political campaign when sarah palin\\nwas asked by sean hannity of fox news for the reaction of her\\ndaughters to her coming campaign: the governor said she \"asked the\\ngirls what they thought, and they\\'re like: \\'absolutely. let\\'s do\\nthis, mom!\\' \" (the use of \"they\\'re like\" rather than \"they\\nsaid\" reflects a current dismissal of the dull verb said; i\\nused a variation above as \"your reply goes\" rather than\\nis to demonstrate with-it-ness.)\\n\\nturn now to the defiantly unexpurgated urban dictionary, a\\ndown-and-dirty repository of what the pioneer slanguist francis\\ngrose in his 1811 dictionary called \"the vulgar tongue.\" today\\'s\\nurban (meaning \"street\") web site defines the new phase of the\\nphrase as \"commonly said by uppity groups of people, but also\\nthose ready to ... just get down to business.\" (i primly\\nbowdlerize.) a second sense: \"usually said before a fight, or when\\nan event is about to go down. you are wanting to be part of this\\nevent.\"\\n\\nhere is a vogue phrase in which punctuation marks define\\nmeaning. if\\nlet\\'s do this is followed by a colon, it coolly suggests a\\nspecific course be taken together. if the phrase is followed by an\\nexclamation mark, it\\'s a command to get moving, buster, or get\\ntrampled in the rush.\\n\\nboots on the ground\\n\\n\"from the barrage of television ads to boots on the ground\"\\nbegan the lead on dan balz\\'s report in the washington post of the\\nobama campaign\\'s final thrust in colorado. this used to be a\\nfootball metaphor -- the \"air game\" and the \"ground game\" -- but\\nthe military metaphor has carried the field.\\n\\ninfantry footwear has been slogging though mud for centuries,\\nbut boots on the ground is a relatively new expression. earliest\\ncitation that matthew seelinger, chief historian of the army\\nhistorical foundation, can find is in an april 11, 1980, article in\\nthe christian science monitor. during the iranian hostage crisis,\\nplans for a rescue operation1 were made in the carter\\nadministration, and there were worries that the soviet union would\\nintervene. \"many american strategists now argue that even light,\\ntoken u.s. land forces -- \\'getting u.s. combat boots on the ground\\'\\n\" -- as the four-star general volney warner put it -- \"would signal\\nto an enemy that the u.s. ... can only be dislodged at the risk of\\nwar.\" the vivid figure of speech soon triumphed over the formal\\n\"infantry in the field.\"\\n\\nthe word boot, in this symbolism, does not stand for a\\nhigh-ankle shoe but for the person who wears it. in 1944, marine\\ninductees were called\\nboots, and their introduction to service in world war ii was in\\nboot camp. as mechanized armor, air and naval technology\\nadvanced, the role of the \"foot soldier\" -- wearer of the boot\\n-- was sometimes overshadowed, but as t.r. fehrenbach wrote in 1963\\nabout the korean conflict, to hold a position \"you must do this on\\nthe ground, the way the roman legions did, by putting your young\\nmen in the mud.\" by the time of the 1991 operation \"desert\\nstorm,\" that strategy was ascendant: although air and sea power\\nwere highly important, a war could not be decisively won and\\nterritory controlled without a credible component of armed\\nindividual human beings on the ground.\\n\\nthroughout 2007 and the 2008 presidential campaign, focus was on\\ntimetables or benchmarks for ultimate withdrawal of u.s. \"boots\"\\nfrom iraq. however, candidates in both political camps (military\\nmetaphors are common in politics) agreed on the need for additional\\nbrigades of u.s. combat troops to suppress a rising threat in\\nafghanistan. in time, defense and diplomatic officials responsible\\nfor national security in the incoming administration will face a\\nquestion framed in a phrase with historical echoes: will there be a\\nneed for more or fewer boots on the ground?\\n\\n(william safire is the author of 27 books. please send your\\ncomments and suggestions to: safireonlanguage@nytimes.com.)\\n\\neditors: for information about purchasing this article, or

police and witnesses said.\\n\\nthe kidnapping was the latest of a series of incidents spreading\\nalarm among foreigners in the capital. it was carried out just\\nafter 9 a.m. on a busy street of shops and homes\\n\\nlast month, a british aid worker with dual south african\\nnationality, gayle williams, 34, was killed in kabul and the\\ntaliban said it had executed her for spreading christianity. there\\nwas no immediate claim for monday\\'s kidnapping but the taliban\\ndenied involvement.\\n\\ntwo french aid workers were making their way from their\\nresidence to their office when three gunmen armed with assault\\nrifles tried to seize them, shopkeepers and bystanders said.\\n\\none french citizen from a group known as afrane, meaning amitie\\nfranco-afghane, or french-afghan friendship, escaped when an afghan\\nworking as a driver in the intelligence service tackled one of the\\nkidnappers and grabbed his gun.\\n\\nthe gunmen killed the driver, pushed the other aid worker into a\\ncar and drove off, witnesses said.\\n\\nnews reports in paris said the abducted man was a french citizen\\nand education expert who had been in kabul for only a week. he had\\nbeen staying with colleagues from afrane, which also specializes in\\neducation projects, but worked for a different french\\nnongovernmental organization.\\n\\nthe news reports identified the kidnapped man as dany egreteau,\\n32, but did not specify the organization he worked for.\\n\\nthe slain man was identified only as malik, 26. his uncle,\\nghulam hazrat, 50, said the kidnappers were dressed as security\\nguards.\\n\\n\"they looked ordinary, they were young, 30 to 35,\" hazrat\\nsaid. \"they aimed their kalashnikovs at me and malik\\'s father,\\nwarning us not to approach.\"\\n\\nthere has been a string of kidnappings in the capital and\\nneighboring provinces recently involving both foreigners and\\nprominent afghans. many of them have been blamed by afghan\\nofficials on criminal gangs seeking ransom.\\n\\na relative of the royal family, homayun shah, and the son of a\\nprominent banker were kidnapped in recent weeks but were freed by\\nthe intelligence service, the national security directorate.\\n\\nthe head of the service, amrullah saleh, went on national\\ntelevision and complained that the man behind these kidnappings was\\na known criminal who had been jailed by security forces, only to be\\nreleased because of failings in the judicial system.\\n\\nin a separate incident last thursday, a suspected taliban\\nsuicide bomber shot his way into the ministry of information and\\nculture in central kabul, then blew himself up, leaving at least\\ntwo others dead. a few days earlier, a south african and a briton\\nworking at the international courier service dhl were shot dead\\noutside their office in kabul. the police said the assailant was\\none of their security guards.\\n\\nmainland china\\'s top negotiator on taiwan matters\\narrived in taipei on monday to begin five days of talks aimed at\\nreaching agreements on transportation and economic deals.\\n\\nthe negotiator, chen yunlin, is the highest ranking mainland\\nchinese official to visit taiwan since the end of the civil war in\\n1949 and his arrival signals a further warming of relations between\\nthe two governments.\\n\\nchen, the head of the association for relations across the\\ntaiwan strait, landed at the taipei airport and went to the\\nhistoric grand hotel, where he made a few remarks to a crowd of\\nreporters. talks are expected to begin on tuesday, when chen meets\\nwith chiang pin-kung, the chairman of the straits exchange\\nfoundation, the main negotiating body for taiwan.\\n\\n\"the step is not easy and is a crystallization of the joint\\nefforts of many compatriots across the strait,\" chen said,\\naccording to xinhua, mainland china\\'s state-run news agency.\\n\\nthe negotiating bodies for the two governments met in june in\\nbeijing after a long hiatus and signed a deal to start regular\\nweekend charter flights between mainland and taiwanese cities. the\\nmeeting took place shortly after the inauguration of president ma\\nying-jeou of taiwan, who was elected last march after promising to\\nimprove both the economy and relations with the mainland.\\n\\nbut ma\\'s popularity has sagged in recent months -- taiwan\\'s\\neconomic performance has been lackluster, and many taiwanese\\ncitizens say ma and his party, the kuomintang, or kmt, are moving\\ntaiwan into mainland china\\'s orbit too quickly.\\n\\nprotests against ma\\'s china policies by the democratic\\nprogressive party, or dpp, the main opposition party, have been\\nfierce. on oct. 21, protests took place when zhang mingqing, the\\nvice chairman of the mainland\\'s negotiating body, toured taiwan.\\nzhang was shoved to the ground by a local politician while visiting\\nthe confucius temple in the southern city of tainan, a bastion of\\nthe dpp.\\n\\nduring chen\\'s visit, the national policy agency is deploying\\n10,000 security officers, according to the news service of the kmt.\\ntraffic controls have been put in place to guard chen\\'s motorcade,\\nand 800 policemen have been posted to the grand hotel, the news\\nservice reported.\\n\\nthe chinese communist party sees taiwan as a rebel province that\\nsplit from china in 1949, when the kmt sought refuge on the island\\nafter losing the chinese civil war, and must be brought back into\\nthe fold. many taiwanese prefer to maintain the current status quo\\nof de facto independence, and some, especially members of the dpp,\\nadvocate formal independence. the former president, chen shui-bian,\\nthe first dpp member to hold that office, tried moving the island\\ncloser to independence.\\n\\nchen, the mainland negotiator, and chiang are expected to sign\\nagreements that increase the charter flight schedule to every other\\nday and open maritime shipping lanes. they are also expected to\\ndiscuss economic cooperation as a way to fight the global financial\\ncrisis.\\n\\n\"it is imperative that the two sides join to help each other to\\ncope,\" chen said on monday, according to xinhua.\\n\\nchen has also said the mainland is again offering to give two\\npandas to taiwan, a move that the beijing government first made in\\n2005 but that was rejected by the former taiwanese president. ma\\nhas indicated he would accept the pandas.\\n\\nthere is rampant speculation in both china and taiwan over\\nwhether chen and ma will meet. if so, the big question is: will\\nchen address ma as zongtong, or president, thus acknowledging that\\nma holds a title that in international affairs is usually accorded\\nonly to the head of a sovereign nation?\\n\\ncox news service\\n\\nas if it hadn\\'t damaged the commonweal enough through eight years\\nof favoring commercial interests over public interests just about\\nevery time they

deadliest of the bombs was planted in front of the\\nprotective concrete wall ringing the government building. the other\\nwas about 70 yards away. two badly burned bodies were stretched on\\nthe street shortly after the explosions.\\n\\n\"i cannot believe what happened,\" said a bewildered policeman\\nat the scene, who said he had worked for the directorate for 35\\nyears. \"who can plant a

that overall levels of violence\\nacross the country were at their lowest since may 2004.\\n\\nin a move that could stoke further tensions between iraq\\'s\\nfractious ethnic and sectarian groups, parliament voted monday in\\nfavor of a bill that would guarantee minorities significantly fewer\\nseats on provincial councils than had been recommended by the u.n.\\nassistance mission for iraq.\\n\\nthe bill would give christians a single seat on councils in\\nbaghdad, basra and nineveh instead of the three seats proposed by\\nthe u.n. mission in each of baghdad and nineveh.\\n\\nthe yazidis, a kurdish-speaking minority who, like christians,\\nhave been reeling from attacks and displacement since the start of\\nthe war in 2003, were given one seat in nineveh instead of the\\nthree proposed.\\n\\nthe new bill is supposed to be a compromise following the\\ncontroversy that erupted in late september when parliament had\\npassed a new provincial election law but deleted an article that\\nhad provided 13 seats in six provinces for iraqi christians,\\nyazidis and other minorities. the new bill grants a total of six\\nseats. the u.n. mission had proposed a total of 12.\\n\\nyounadim kanna, one of two christians in parliament, called\\nmonday\\'s vote \"a great insult.\"\\n\\n\"there is no desire to respect minorities as the indigenous\\npeople of this country,\"

that\\ncompetitors will find hard to match.\\n\\nin fact, general motors and ford have given up on the minivan\\nsegment for lack of a product that can come close to the current\\nmodels in the chrysler llc minivan lineup.\\n\\nsales of minivans have cooled somewhat since the arrival of suvs\\nand now crossover utility vehicles, but the segment is still\\nstrong, accounting for nearly a million units sold annually.\\n\\nthe only minivan competition dodge and chrysler face now is from\\nthe import-brand models, the honda odyssey, toyota sienna, nissan\\nquest, hyundai entourage and kia sedona.\\n\\ngm says its new family of large crossovers, which includes the\\nchevrolet traverse, gmc acadia, saturn outlook and buick enclave,\\nare intended to compete against the minivan segment, but they lack\\nthe sliding passenger doors that most minivan consumers love.\\n\\nwhile they are still minivans, the revised exterior styling of\\nthe chrysler and dodge models gives them more of a crossover look,\\nwhile retaining the sliding passenger doors on each side that allow\\nfor quick and convenient access to the second and third rows. power\\ndoors are available on both sides and can be operated from the key\\nfob or using switches up front or on the door pillars on each side.\\n\\nfor 2009, the chrysler and dodge minivans come in five different\\nmodels, with three different seating and storage systems and great\\nnew entertainment options, including live satellite tv.\\n\\nthe chrysler town &amp;amp; country models are the base lx, midlevel\\ntouring and top-of-the-line limited, with prices ranging from\\n$25,730 to $36,530 (plus $770 freight and options). the\\nshort-wheelbase models previously known as the dodge caravan and\\nchrysler voyager have been dropped; all of the new vans are of the\\nextended length.\\n\\ndodge versions come in base se and uplevel sxt models, with base\\nprices of $23,530 and $27,825, respectively.\\n\\nfor this report, we tested the 2009 grand caravan se, which\\ncomes with the base 3.3-liter v-6 engine and a four-speed automatic\\ntransmission.\\n\\nstandard on the se model are the latest in chrysler\\'s\\nstow-and-go seats, which can be folded completely into the floor to\\ncreate a flat cargo surface from the back of the front seats all\\nthe way to the tailgate.\\n\\nbut our tester came with the new swivel \\'n\\' go seats, a $495\\noption. with this feature, the middle-row seats swivel to face the\\nthird row, and there is a stowable table that can be set up between\\nthe seats so the people in the back can play games or eat their\\nsnacks on it.\\n\\nanother great option is the new sirius live satellite tv system,\\nwhich delivers favorite children\\'s shows from the disney channel,\\nnickelodeon and the cartoon network. it was not included on our\\ntest vehicle, but i have seen it on other models.\\n\\nthree powertrain options are available, beginning with the se\\'s\\n3.3-liter v-6, rated at 175 horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of\\ntorque. this engine can operate on e85 fuel, which is 85 percent\\nethanol and 15 percent gasoline. it comes only with the four-speed\\nautomatic.\\n\\nstandard on the sxt is a 3.8-liter v-6, which offers 197\\nhorsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. it comes with a new\\nsix-speed automatic transmission.\\n\\noptional is a 4.0-liter v-6, which puts out 251 horsepower and\\n259 foot-pounds of torque. it\\'s also connected to a six-speed\\nautomatic.\\n\\noddly, the biggest engine has the best epa rating -- 17 miles per\\ngallon city/25 highway, while our se model with the base engine was\\nrated at 17 city/24 highway. the midlevel 3.8-liter engine is rated\\nat 16 city/23 highway.\\n\\nchrysler made some improvements to the 4.0-liter engine for 2009\\nthat boosted its fuel economy from last year\\'s 16 city/23 highway.\\n\\nchrysler should offer the six-speed automatic as at least an\\noption on the se, as it would boost highway fuel economy to above\\nthat of the sxt with the 4.0-liter engine.\\n\\nthe biggest advantage of the small v-6 is the price rather than\\nthe mileage.\\n\\nalthough it gets just 1 mpg less on the highway, the 3.3-liter\\ncomes in a vehicle whose overall price is several thousand dollars\\nless than the sxt with the optional 4.0-liter v-6. to add that\\nengine to the sxt costs $630.\\n\\ni\\'m no speed demon, though, and i found the 3.3-liter engine to\\nbe adequate for my needs, although i didn\\'t have the opportunity to\\nload the grand caravan se full of people and cargo during my\\nweeklong test. with a full load, one of the larger engines would\\noffer better acceleration and more hill-climbing power.\\n\\nthe ride and handling of the se model are more carlike than you\\nwould expect for a boxy people-hauler such as this, a credit to the\\nengineering changes that went into the new model. it\\'s a smooth and\\ncomfortable ride, but the handling is surprisingly crisp.\\n\\nthe van also is very quiet inside, the better to listen to the\\nkids\\' quarreling or the great optional audio system.\\n\\nmodels with the swivel middle-row seats also feature an optional\\nintegrated child booster seat. also available is a one-touch\\npower-folding third-row bench seat ($595).\\n\\namong standard safety features are roof-mounted side-curtain air\\nbags for all three rows, along with electronic stability control\\nand anti-lock brakes.\\n\\nincluded on our tester was the \"popular equipment group\"\\n($1,495), which added power sliding doors and liftgate. also on our\\nvehicle was the \"climate group\" ($995), which brought three-zone\\nmanual air conditioning. we also had the upgraded mygig audio\\nsystem ($725) with a 30-gigabyte hard drive and the rear back-up\\ncamera.\\n\\ntotal sticker price of our test vehicle was $28,235, including\\nfreight and options.\\n\\nthe package: extended-length, front-drive, six-cylinder, seven-\\nto eight-passenger minivan.\\n\\nhighlights: completely redesigned for 2008, these are the best\\nminivans yet -- from any automaker -- and include lots of innovative\\nnew features.\\n\\nnegatives: less expensive short-wheelbase voyager model has been\\ndiscontinued, as has the four-cylinder engine, which offered the\\nbest fuel economy.\\n\\nengines: 3.3-liter v-6, 3.8-liter v-6, 4.0-liter\\nv-6.transmission: four-speed automatic (base model), six-speed\\nautomatic (uplevel models).\\n\\npower/torque: 175 hp/205 foot-pounds; 197 hp/230 foot-pounds;\\n251 hp/259 foot-pounds.\\n\\nlength: 202.5 inches.\\n\\ncurb weight: 4,431-4,499 pounds.\\n\\ncargo capacity: 32.7 cubic feet (3rd seat in place).epa fuel\\neconomy: 17 city/24 highway (3.3 engine); 16/23 (3.8 engine); 17/25\\n(4.0 engine).\\n\\nmajor competitors: honda odyssey, toyota sienna, nissan quest,\\nhyundai entourage, kia sedona.\\n\\nbase price range: $23,530-$27,825 (plus $770 freight).\\n\\nprice as tested: $28,235 with freight and options (se model).\\n\\non the road rating: 9.2 (of a possible 10).\\n\\nprices shown are manufacturer\\'s suggested list; actual selling\\nprice may vary.\\n\\na close friend of president bush\\'s is trying to build a golf\\ncourse in\\nnorthwestern connecticut. many residents in the towns of norfolk\\nand north\\ncanaan oppose the 780-acre project, lamenting its effect on the\\nforests,\\nmeadows, and trout streams in their corner of the litchfield hills.\\nand\\nwhile a federal agency has concluded that the project would not\\nharm the\\nhabitat of a turtle on the government\\'s list of threatened species,\\nopponents suspect - not without reason - that the decision was\\nrushed\\nthrough while bush is still in office.\\n\\nthe developer, roland betts, knows bush from his college days\\nand was a\\nco-owner with bush of the texas rangers baseball team. his plan\\nwould draw\\n150,000 gallons a day of groundwater from the highland site.\\nwildlife\\nbiologists are worried that this loss of water, the use of\\npesticides on\\nthe golf course, and the movement of 480,000 cubic yards of soil to\\ncreate\\nthe 18 holes could make betts\\'s land and surrounding acreage less\\nhospitable to bog turtles. in 1998, a connecticut state biologist\\nfound a\\nfemale bog turtle on land near, but not on, betts\\'s property.\\n\\nin july, a consultant hired by betts filed a report with the us\\nfish and\\nwildlife service, stating he could find no bog turtles on betts\\'s\\nland and\\nthat the land was at a higher elevation than the turtles usually\\ninhabit.\\neven though fish and wildlife officials knew that consultants for\\nproject\\nopponents were on the verge of filing their own report, the\\nofficials\\nimmediately notified the us army corps of engineers that the golf\\ncourse\\npresented no problems with regard to threatened or endangered\\nspecies.\\n\\nas a result, neither fish and wildlife nor the corps weighed the\\nreport of\\nthe opponents\\' consultants, which found - not surprisingly - that\\nwetlands\\nnear betts\\'s land are suitable sites for the turtle, especially as\\nglobal\\nwarming makes higher elevations more to their liking.\\n\\nthis is not the first time that consultants on opposite sides of\\nan issue\\nhave come up with conflicting findings. but fish and wildlife,\\nwhich\\ndenies there was pressure for a quick decision, should have\\nconsidered both\\nbefore reaching its conclusion. the endangered species act requires\\nthe\\nagency to use the best scientific data available in making\\ndecisions.\\n\\nto abide by the law and end any suspicion that betts is getting\\nspecial\\ntreatment from his buddy in the oval office, fish and wildlife\\nshould\\nwithdraw its finding until appointees in the next administration\\nhave a\\nchance to review the evidence - all the evidence. the state of\\nconnecticut,\\nfor its part, should freeze consideration of the project until the\\nturtle\\nquestion gets a more thorough airing.\\n\\nthe number of homeless families has surged to a record high in\\nmassachusetts. some 2,500 families are homeless, up from about\\n1,500 two\\nyears ago. and more than 600 homeless families are staying in\\nmotels,\\ncaring for children in rooms, often far from school, with little\\nmore than\\nbeds, a tv, and maybe a hotplate. given the faltering economy, even\\nmore\\nfamilies could end up in shelters.\\n\\nthis renewed dependence on putting homeless families in\\ntemporary quarters\\nrepresents a step backward for massachusetts. especially under the\\npatrick\\nadministration, the state had sought to end homelessness by 2013 by\\nmoving\\npeople out of shelters and toward the stability of economic\\nself-sufficiency and permanent housing.\\n\\nwhile the number of households falling into economic jeopardy\\nwill test the\\nstate\\'s ability to handle each case in a comprehensive way, this\\nfar-reaching approach remains the best way to make sure families\\nstay off\\nthe streets in the long term.\\n\\nshelter alone may not be enough to keep the homeless off the\\nstreets. what\\nthey may really need is help paying back rent, finding a new job,\\nor\\ngetting treatment for an addiction. and families who are already in\\nshelters need help moving out more quickly.\\n\\nfortunately, massachusetts is still working on transforming its\\nhomelessness efforts to provide the \"right resources to the right\\npeople\\nat the right time,\" as the massachusetts commission to end\\nhomelessness\\ncalled for earlier this year. armed with $10 million in state\\nfunds, the\\nstate\\'s interagency council on housing and homelessness plans to\\nstart a\\nsweeping experiment: instead of automatic placement in shelters,\\nhomeless\\nfamilies will be able to get a personalized response to their\\nproblems.\\nthis might be a short shelter stay, but it might also be rent money\\nor a\\nreferral for mental health counseling. some of the interagency\\ncouncil\\'s\\nmoney will also fund job training.\\n\\nstate officials are looking for private funding to boost this\\neffort, and\\nthey will track the outcomes and figure out how to expand the\\nprograms that\\nwork best.\\n\\n\"if we weren\\'t doing this now, it would be worse,\" robert\\npulster, the\\ninteragency council\\'s executive director, says of the state\\'s\\nhomelessness\\nproblem.\\n\\nfor now, massachusetts has to keep its shelters open, to cope\\nwith current\\nhousing emergencies. but over the next few years, some of the money\\nthat\\nthe state now spends on shelters should be shifted to programs that\\nhelp\\npeople develop the skills to support themselves in permanent\\nhousing. the\\nstate\\'s overburdened shelter system is a relic that has to give way\\nto more\\nmodern and effective solutions.\\n\\nin his new position as head of the u.s.\\ncentral command, gen. david h. petraeus met top pakistani officials\\nfor the first time monday and heard one message wherever he turned:\\namerican air strikes against militants in the tribal areas are\\nunhelpful.\\n\\npetraeus, the former commander of american forces in iraq,\\narrived in pakistan as missile strikes from drone aircraft against\\nthe taliban and al-qaida in pakistan\\'s tribal areas have escalated.\\nthere were two separate missile attacks by american drones on\\nsaturday. in retaliation, a suicide bomber killed eight pakistani\\nparamilitary soldiers in south waziristan sunday.\\n\\nafter the meeting with petraeus, president asif ali zardari of\\npakistan said in a statement, \"continuing drone attacks on our\\nterritory, which result in loss of precious lives and property, are\\ncounterproductive and difficult to explain by a democratically\\nelected government. it is creating a credibility gap.\"\\n\\nthere was no comment or public appearances by petraeus, and it\\nwas not clear how he responded to the complaints. messages left\\nwith his press aides were not immediately returned.\\n\\npetraeus, who has been consulting in recent weeks with a wide\\nrange of people on the efforts by the pakistani military to quell\\nthe insurgency in the tribal areas and on the deteriorating\\nsituation in afghanistan, on friday took over central command ,\\nputting him in overall charge of the american-led military\\noperations in both iraq and afghanistan.\\n\\nthe general\\'s visit came as the pentagon and the white house are\\ncompleting reviews on policies towards afghanistan, and as sen.\\nbarack obama, the democratic presidential nominee, has made clear\\nthat pakistan and afghanistan would be more of a foreign policy\\nfocus if he were to win the election. in an interview on cnn\\nbroadcast this past weekend, obama said he believed it was\\nnecessary to convince pakistan that the main threat to its security\\ncame from the militants, and not india, its historical enemy.\\n\\nduring his round of calls with the pakistani government monday,\\npetraeus met with the commander of the pakistani military, gen.\\nashfaq parvez kayani, and the defense minister, ahmad mukhtar.\\n\\nthe american missile attacks in the tribal areas were generating\\n\"anti-american sentiments\" and creating \"outrage and uproar\\namong the people,\" mukhtar said in a statement.\\n\\na senior pakistani military official said the army wanted to\\n\"bring home the point that the missile strikes are\\ncounter-productive, and that this is driving a wedge between the\\ngovernment and the tribal people.\"\\n\\npakistani officials have consistently complained about the air\\nstrikes that have been aimed at arab fighters and pakistani\\nmilitants connected to al-qaida.\\n\\nbut the statements against the air strikes have been couched in\\nless dramatic language than kayani\\'s declaration after an american\\nground raid in september in which he said pakistan would defend its\\nborders at \"all costs.\" there have been no known ground raids in\\nthe tribal areas since.\\n\\non a more positive note, the senior pakistani military official,\\nwho declined to be identified by name because of the sensitivity of\\nthe subject, said that the united states had started to \"listening\\nto us\" and had moved towards sealing the border between\\nafghanistan and pakistan in the area of bajaur in the tribal area.\\n\\nthe pakistani army is fighting taliban militants in bajaur, and\\nhas criticized the united states for what it says is the failure of\\namerican troops in afghanistan to stop afghan militants crossing\\ninto bajaur and joining the battle.\\n\\nthe americans had moved some of their forces to the east of the\\nkunar river last week and this had helped curb the flow of\\nmilitants into bajaur, the pakistani military official said. \"it\\nis bearing positive results,\" he said.\\n\\nin an effort to show petraeus the hard terrain that the\\npakistani forces face against the insurgents in the tribal areas,\\nthe military planned to fly him over some of the terrain tuesday,\\nthe military official said.\\n\\nthat way, the general would get an idea of the long porous\\nborder between afghanistan and pakistan. \"we will let him see\\nwhere the roads end and where the mountains start,\" the official\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"it will be a glimpse of the tora bora from the other side,\"\\nhe said, referring to the area in afghanistan near the pakistani\\nborder from where osama bin laden is believed to have escaped from\\namerican troops in late 2001.\\n\\nduring a visit tuesday to peshawar, the capital of the\\nnorth-west frontier province, petreaus planned to meet with maj.\\ngen. tariq khan, the new leader of the frontier corps, the\\nparamilitary force that is fighting in bajaur.\\n\\nafter a long delay, several dozen american and british trainers\\nbegan instructing pakistani officers last month, who in turn will\\ntrain the frontier corps in an effort to turn the paramilitary\\nforce into a more effective group of indigenous counterinsurgency\\nfighters.\\n\\nthe pakistani military officials planned to ask petraeus for\\nhelp in increasing the army\\'s \"operational capabilities,\" meaning\\nequipment. but the army was reluctant to accept training. \"why\\nshould they get into our areas?\" the senior military official\\nasked.\\n\\nwhy adults foist albert lamorisse\\'s \"the red balloon\" (1956)\\non children\\nseems obvious enough. its human protagonist, pascal, is a wee\\nparisian\\ngrade-schooler, and its non-human protagonist is a levitating bag\\nof air.\\nwhimsy guides all 34 minutes of the film. but like the best works\\nthat\\norbit around children, \"the red balloon\" is also about the world\\n- good,\\nbad, and ugly. pascal finds the balloon tethered to a white rope\\ntied to a\\nlamppost. they forge a fast friendship whose mutual devotion\\ndelights some\\n(there\\'s a lovely montage of people sharing their umbrellas with\\nballoon)\\nand annoys others (did that woman just swat it while boarding a\\nstreetcar?). balloon is more than alive. it\\'s old and ineffably\\nhuman.\\n\\n\"the red balloon\" is on the same disc with lamorisse\\'s \"white\\nmane\"\\n(they were released separately last spring). the latter film is\\nabout a\\nwild stallion that refuses to be lassoed. arrestingly photographed\\nin black\\nand white (\"the red balloon\" is in technicolor), \"white mane\"\\nis \"the\\nred balloon\" with an older boy and unadulterated anger, all of\\nwhich comes\\nfrom that eponymous horse.\\n\\nthe ruling response to both movies, whether you\\'re 31 or 13, is\\nawe. but\\nwhile both have happy endings of a sort - \"the red balloon\" made\\nme cry;\\n\"white mane\" stressed me out - they\\'re complicated: lamorisse is\\nshowing\\nus flights from man\\'s cruelty and covetousness. if neither makes\\nsense when\\nyou\\'re 9, come back to them in about 10 years.\\n\\nextras: theatrical trailers for each film (criterion, $19.95)\\n\\na better angel, by chris adrian. strange and

island,\\nstraining\\npolice and social services.\\n\\nfor police, the end of summer used to signal a respite from the\\nfull-tilt\\npace of watching over an island packed with tourists and seasonal\\nresidents.\\n\\n\"now, instead of slowing down, it\\'s literally been 100 miles\\nper hour\\nconstantly,\" said police chief william pittman.\\n\\ntown clerk catherine stover, whose family dates back eight\\ngenerations on\\nnantucket, began locking her door after the second rape. peter\\nswenson, who\\ndirects a social service agency here, recently moved with his wife\\nand two\\nsmall children to what he believes is a safer location on the\\nisland. and\\nnikki, a waitress who begins work before dawn, said she has started\\nlocking\\nher doors and windows.\\n\\n\"i used to be able to walk to work with a flashlight, but i\\ndon\\'t do that\\nanymore,\" nikki said. \"now i take a cab for $17 each way.\\nseriously. it\\'s\\ntoo scary.\"\\n\\nin other violence this year, two cyclists were beaten and robbed\\nat night\\non a bike path. a 9-year-old special-needs child allegedly was\\nabducted\\nfrom a playground by a landscaper and sexually assaulted in his\\ntruck and\\nhome before being placed on a bus. and reports of domestic violence\\nhave\\nincreased across a broad range of income and ethnic groups, said\\nkat\\nrobinson grieder, executive director of a safe place, whose staff\\nworks\\nwith victims of such violence.\\n\\nswenson, executive director of family and children\\'s services of\\nnantucket, sees alcohol as a continuing factor in many of the\\nisland\\'s\\nproblems, particularly during tough economic times when the\\nconstruction\\nindustry is suffering.\\n\\n\"the use of alcohol and other drugs has increased,\" swenson\\nsaid. \"mix\\nthat with stress and anxiety, and you tend to have violent\\nacting-out.\"\\n\\nswenson said his staff, many of whom are women, now always leave\\nthe\\noffice with somebody else at the end of the day.\\n\\npittman, the police chief, said there have been fewer total\\narrests this\\nyear, but he acknowledged that there has been a surge in violent,\\nhigh-profile crime. although the reason is hard to pinpoint,\\npittman agreed\\nthat nantucket had changed in the four years he has worked here.\\n\\n\"you go to a lot of neighborhoods today and people say, \\'i\\ndon\\'t know who\\nlives beside me anymore,\"\\' pittman said.\\n\\nover and over, in interviews across the island, residents\\ndescribed an\\nincreasing sense of vulnerability and alienation, exacerbated by\\nthe\\npopulation increase.\\n\\n\"there are just too many rats in the cage,\" stover said of\\nnantucket,\\n\"and every one of us is a rat.\"\\n\\nas they have for decades, laborers, landscapers, and workers in\\nthe\\nconstruction trades have looked to nantucket for quick money and\\nentertainment. but unlike in the past, pittman and others said,\\nmany of the\\ntransients are putting down roots and staying through the winter. a\\nlarge\\npercentage of them are foreign nationals, from salvadorans to\\nbulgarians to\\nirish to jamaicans, whose presence sometimes has caused what\\npittman called\\n\"cultural differences and misunderstandings.\"\\n\\nsome of that tension results in imagined threats. police once\\nwere called\\nabout a suspected drug deal, the chief said, when the reality was\\nan\\ninnocent exchange of packaging between two friends. in another\\nincident, he\\nsaid, a suspected attempted assault was actually an unexpected\\nencounter\\nbetween a young cyclist and a surprised hispanic laborer.\\n\\n\"you\\'ve got some guy sitting in the bike path, ... and suddenly\\nthe cops\\nare swooping in on him,\" pittman said.\\n\\nthose extra residents, legal and otherwise, use the schools,\\nseek care at\\nthe hospital, and put strains on other municipal services that\\nnantucket\\nmust subsidize.\\n\\n\"if people are here, they deserve services,\" stover said.\\n\"but we also\\ndeserve, in return, to know who they are and receive state and\\nfederal\\nfunding for those services.\"\\n\\nin the meantime, police are pressing their investigation of the\\nrapes,\\nwhich pittman believes were committed by the same person. and as\\nhis\\nofficers work, the chief said, he understands why no amount of\\nreassurance\\nwill allay the fears of some residents.\\n\\n\"we proceed as if that suspect is still among us,\" pittman\\nsaid.\\n\\non nov. 19 at the los angeles auto show, nissan will roll out\\nthe 2009 370z sports car, a completely redesigned, higher-power\\nversion of the iconic z car that has been in the automaker\\'s lineup\\noff and on for nearly 40 years.\\n\\nit replaces the 350z, with the new numerical designation\\nreferring to the bigger engine -- a 3.7-liter v-6 that replaces the\\ncurrent 3.5-liter.\\n\\nfor those who want to take a virtual spin in the new z car,\\nabout eight weeks before it goes on sale, a new video game from\\nelectronic arts will go on sale nov. 18 featuring the 370z as its\\nstar.\\n\\ncalled \"need for speed: undercover,\" the new game was\\ndeveloped by black box of vancouver, canada, in conjunction with\\nnissan\\'s designers.\\n\\nit will be offered in all of the key video game formats. those\\ninclude xbox 360, playstation 3, wii, playstation 2, nintendo ds,\\nplaystation portable handheld and pc.\\n\\nthis is the first time an automaker has made the world\\nintroduction of one of its new models in a video game, nissan said.\\n\\n\"for the past 15 years, \\'need for speed\\' has helped define\\ncontemporary automotive culture by bridging the gap between gamers\\nand the world\\'s hottest cars,\" keith munro, vice president for\\nmarketing at electronic arts, said in an announcement.\\n\\n\"as such, we are very excited to partner with one of the\\nautomotive powerhouses today to exclusively reveal the all-new\\nnissan z,\" he said. \"\\'need for speed\\' is about style, fast-paced\\naction and power; this is definitely a car made for \\'need for\\nspeed\\' fans.\"\\n\\nit\\'s also the first time a new vehicle can be driven in a game\\nbefore it\\'s available at dealerships, he said.\\n\\n\"our relationship with ea has been instrumental in bringing the\\nnissan brand to a passionate and unique audience,\" said christian\\nmeunier, nissan\\'s marketing vice president. \"by launching the\\nall-new 2009 nissan z first through \\'need for speed: undercover,\\'\\nwe also gain the spirit and energy that ea gamers experience so\\nstrongly. together with ea, we have truly integrated the all-new\\n370z in the overall game experience in a meaningful, multilayered\\nand profound way.\"\\n\\nea\\'s designers worked with nissan to \"accurately replicate the\\noverall look, feel and performance\" of the new z, the automaker\\nsaid, adding that, \"from the game\\'s opening moment, players will\\nbe thrust right into the action with gamers whipping the 370z in\\nand out of traffic at high speed.\"\\n\\nnot even the automotive media have been given a chance to drive\\nthe new z yet. but a few of us were treated to a close-up look at\\nthe car in july in a secure future-product vault in the basement of\\nnissan\\'s new $100 million headquarters building near nashville,\\ntenn. that sneak preview came during grand opening ceremonies for\\nthe building, which the automaker began occupying in early july.\\n\\nthe car will come with a 3.7-liter version of the award-winning\\nvq engine series, replacing the 3.5-liter vq engine used in the\\n2008 model. the current\\n\\n350z was introduced for 2003 as the fifth generation of the z,\\nbringing the vehicle back to the nissan lineup after a nearly\\nseven-year absence. the previous generation, the 300zx, was\\ndiscontinued in 1996.\\n\\nthe 2009 370z has been changed enough to qualify it as the sixth\\ngeneration, and the new engine should be a big hit with z\\nenthusiasts. a version of that engine was introduced last year to\\npower the new infiniti g37 coupe, and has been added to the g35\\nsedan for 2009, forcing it to be renamed the g37.\\n\\nno horsepower rating has been released yet for the engine in the\\n370z -- but in the 2009 g37 coupe, it\\'s rated at 330 horsepower; in\\nthe g37 sedan, it has 328 horsepower.\\n\\na seven-speed automatic transmission is offered as an option on\\nthe \\'09 g37 and presumably would be available in the 370z as well.\\nthe 2008 infiniti g models have a six-speed automatic, which is\\ncarried over to the new g models as the base transmission.\\n\\nin the 2008 model of the 350z, the 3.5-liter engine is rated at\\n306 horsepower. the only transmissions offered are a six-speed\\nmanual and five-speed automatic.\\n\\nno other details of the new z have been given yet, but one\\nexterior photo has been released, as well as some shots of the car\\nfrom the video game.\\n\\nthe 2009 370z coupe will begin reaching dealerships early next\\nyear, the automaker said.\\n\\nwhat language does your bank speak?\\n\\nforeign banks could soon control nearly a third of

might put on\\nthe block.\\n\"there are no sacred cows,\" new chief executive stephen hester\\nsaid on a\\nconference call that day when asked if the bank might sell american\\nassets.\\n\\nsecond, banco santander of madrid has promised cost savings when\\nit takes\\nover sovereign after a flight of depositors and a free-fall in its\\nshare\\nprice.\\n\\nboth banks and their parent companies have declined requests to\\ninterview\\nexecutives about their strategies. on its earnings call with\\nanalysts last\\nweek, santander barely mentioned its pending purchase of sovereign.\\n\\nbut analysts and business figures see changes coming. in the\\ncase of\\ncitizens bank in particular, grogan and others wonder whether\\nhester will\\nallow local executives the same independence as his predecessor,\\nsir fred\\ngoodwin, an architect of royal bank\\'s us strategy.\\n\\nterrence murray, the former chief executive of fleetboston\\nfinancial corp.,\\nsaid in an interview he expects citizens will wind up being sold as\\na way\\nfor royal bank to pay back the government\\'s cash infusion.\\n\\n\"they\\'ll want to contract and de-leverage and get some of their\\nmoney\\nback,\" murray said. executives at both citizens and royal bank\\ndeclined\\ncomment on a potential sale.\\n\\nmeanwhile, sovereign\\'s deal with santander can only improve its\\nfortunes,\\nmurray said. \"sovereign was flat on its back, and with santander\\nit\\'s a\\nlot stronger.\"\\n\\nbetween them, citizens\\' and sovereign\\'s total deposits of $35\\nbillion\\namount to 19 percent of total deposits in the state, according to\\nthe\\nlatest federal figures. the local financial industry had already\\nfaced an\\nupheaval after bank of america corp., the state\\'s biggest lender,\\nsaid on\\nsept. 15 it would buy brokerage giant merrill lynch &amp;amp; co. for $50\\nbillion\\nand began to combine some wealth-management operations including\\nmany in\\nboston.\\n\\nalso, the fourth-largest bank in the state, td bank, is owned by\\ncanada\\'s\\ntoronto-dominion bank, with deposits of $7.5 billion. florida data\\nfirm snl\\nfinancial says that assuming the sovereign deal is completed, 28\\npercent of\\ndeposits in massachusetts would be held by foreign institutions,\\nfar above\\nthe us average of 6 percent. only four other states ranked higher,\\nincluding two that are citizens bank strongholds: rhode island,\\nwhere 55\\npercent of deposits were held by foreign-owned institutions, and\\nnew\\nhampshire, with 47 percent.\\n\\n\"we\\'re now part of the great

hasn\\'t meant major differences in the\\nway the\\nbanks conduct themselves locally to customers. after royal bank of\\nscotland, whose total us deposits of $94.7 billion make it the\\ncountry\\'s\\neighth-largest bank, other big foreign lenders operating here\\ninclude\\nbritain\\'s hsbc holdings plc and france\\'s bnp paribas group.\\n\\nculver said the test now is whether the new leaders will allow\\ncitizens and\\nsovereign to continue to lend money both to individuals, in the\\nform of\\nmortgages or home equity and auto loans, and to commercial\\nbusinesses, both\\nstaples of citizens\\' and sovereign\\'s businesses to date.\\n\\nso far so good, say some business representatives like brian\\ngilmore,\\nexecutive vice president of the trade group associated industries\\nof\\nmassachusetts. both banks have told him they\\'re looking to make new\\nloans,\\nhe said, and so far companies say they\\'re still able to borrow\\nmoney.\\n\\n\"i haven\\'t heard anyone clamoring for lending compared to what\\ni heard 20\\nyears ago when we were all sitting on our doorstep,\" he said.\\n\\nthe bigger changes may be for other banks, said new hampshire\\nbankers\\nassociation president jerry little, such as if a foreign owner\\nmoves to\\nreplace computer systems with its own. that could give smaller\\nbanks the\\nchance to peel away some of its customers. \"there are always\\ncustomers who\\nget a little frustrated\" during bank mergers even because of\\nsimple\\nchanges like having to get new checks or dealing with new\\nexecutives, he\\nsaid. \"the challenge to these institutions is to pull off these\\nmergers so\\nthey don\\'t lose any of their current book of business.\"\\n\\ncitizens bank is run by citizens financial group of providence.\\nin a\\nstatement to the globe on oct. 13, hester included citizens among\\nassets he\\ncalled \"very attractive.\"\\n\\nhester is becoming royal bank chief executive as part of a deal\\nby royal\\nbank to accept an infusion from the british government as part of a\\n$64\\nbillion package spread among three banks. the cash comes with many\\nmore\\nstrings than similar infusions to american banks from washington,\\nsuch as\\nrequirements the bank continue lending at 2007 levels. a citizens\\nspokeswoman said those limits don\\'t apply to the domestic bank. in\\nlondon,\\na british treasury spokesman said commercial decisions such as\\nwhether to\\nsell assets would be made by royal bank itself.\\n\\nmeanwhile, santander has said little about its intentions for\\nsovereign, in\\nwhich it had already purchased a 25 percent stake three years ago.\\non oct.\\n13, it disclosed plans to buy the remaining 75 percent for $1.9\\nbillion in\\nstock, ending a period of uncertainty for sovereign after it saw\\nsteep\\ncustomer outflows and replaced its chief executive suddenly in\\nseptember.\\n\\nsantander has since told sovereign employees it will keep\\nincoming chief\\nexecutive, paul perrault, and called sovereign \"an attractive\\nentry\\npoint\" into the northeastern us market. it has also made\\nreferences to\\ncost-cutting and efficiencies, which could lead to job cuts.\\n\\nat the least the sovereign deal seems to have reassured\\ndepositors who in\\nthe third quarter had pulled $4.2 billion out of the institution,\\nnearly 9\\npercent of its deposits. sovereign said its deposits have\\nstabilized and\\nstressed a similar theme in newspaper advertisements it began\\nrunning last\\nweek about new

\"a\\ngangsta\\'s girl\" and \"a hood chick\\'s story,\" tales of girls who\\nget\\ncaught up in street life.\\n\\nurban fiction - also known as street lit or street fiction - is\\na style of\\nliterature that depicts drugs, violence, and sexual promiscuity in\\nblack\\nand latino neighborhoods. some of the books detail the extravagant\\nlifestyles of drug dealers. others describe the bloody violence\\nassociated\\nwith the drug trade. the sex scenes in some of the novels are\\nextremely\\nexplicit, and sex is often used as a form of power rather than an\\nexpression of love.\\n\\nthe genre is not new: authors such as donald goines and iceberg\\nslim began\\nwriting about the world of pimps, gangsters, and drug dealers in\\nthe 1970s.\\nbut recently a younger generation of writers such as teri woods,\\ncarl\\nweber, and nikki turner have begun delving into urban fiction. some\\nstarted\\nas self-published authors who sold their books from the trunks of\\ntheir\\ncars. the books quickly won great acclaim among readers, allowing\\nthe new\\nauthors to establish independent book companies and ultimately sign\\ndeals\\nwith major publishers. in the past few years, the genre has\\nexploded in\\npopularity. according to nielsen bookscan, only 4,000 urban fiction\\nnovels\\nwere sold in 2005, representing 0.2 percent of adult fiction book\\nsales. in\\n2007, urban fiction accounted for 4 percent of the adult fiction\\nmarket,\\nwith 82,000 copies sold.\\n\\nfrom the genre\\'s rebirth, it has experienced scrutiny and\\ncontroversy. the\\nbooks initially were criticized for their racy sexual content as\\nwell as\\ntheir spelling and grammatical errors. as more teenagers fall under\\nthe\\nspell of street-lit novels, some adults worry about how the content\\nis\\ninfluencing teenagers. but teens and some adults insist that the\\ncontent\\nof the books doesn\\'t change mind-sets.\\n\\nas a result of the controversy, major publishing houses have\\nreleased\\nyoung-adult series such as kimani tru, bluford, and hotlanta for\\nteens\\nyearning for books with an inner-city vibe. these new series have\\navoided\\ncriticism because the

the mayan riviera along the yucatan peninsula is\\nrenowned for its spectacular beaches, stretching from the\\nincreasingly las vegas-like cancun to solitary stretches of white\\nand turquoise to the south.\\n\\nbut in the beach town of tulum, about two hours south of cancun,\\na new kind of tourism is emerging: the jungle vacation. a growing\\nnumber of developers and hoteliers are beginning to market the\\nallure of the area\\'s thick jungle, home to mayan villagers,\\nmysterious underground pools and the occasional jaguar.\\n\\npioneers of this movement into the jungle are mari and lou\\npintkowski, a colorado couple who came to tulum about five years\\nago with the familiar dream of building a bed and breakfast. but\\nwhen the process of building a beachfront hotel turned into a\\nbureaucratic nightmare, the couple moved their operations into the\\njungle town of macario gomez, about 12 miles from the beach.\\n\\n\"we had just fallen in love with the jungle,\" mari pintkowski\\nremembered. \"it was so peaceful and we woke up every morning with\\nthe singing of the birds.\"\\n\\nrecently, my wife and i had a chance to stay at the pintowski\\'s\\nunique la selva mariposa - they call it an \"elegant jungle bed and\\nbreakfast\" - and see for ourselves what the fuss was about.\\n\\nthe place is just a 20-minute drive from tulum and another 20\\nminutes from the spectacular coba ruins, where centuries-old mayan\\ntemples are enshrouded by creeping jungle.\\n\\nas we drove down an unmarked dirt road to the tiny four-room bed\\nand breakfast, i quickly realized the selva mariposa was unlike\\nanything i\\'ve ever seen: the couple has fashioned exquisitely\\nlandscaped pools in front of the rooms with cool, transparent water\\nfrom nearby underground sources. a hammock hung invitingly over our\\npool, nestled into a riot of colorful vegetation.\\n\\ninside, our room was made of luxurious tzlam and cataloch wood\\ncut out of the surrounding jungle and cleverly illuminated mayan\\nsculptures made of polished limestone.\\n\\nthe bathroom was also unique, with an open-air shower. in the\\nmornings we could look up and see the sun playing off the jungle\\ncanopy (and got a few mosquito bites in the process). a\\nhollowed-out tree trunk holding a living fern sat in the corner of\\nthe shower.\\n\\nwe were also reminded that despite our plush surroundings, we\\nwere indeed in the jungle - the room came with a long pickup stick\\nto grab scorpions. luckily we never had to use it, but we made sure\\nour feet were shod whenever we walked around the room.\\n\\nbeyond the explosion of interesting plant life (think wildly\\ncolored orchids and fire-orange palms), the best part of the jungle\\nare the sounds: at dawn and dusk the hotel was overrun by local\\nbirds, their singing and warbling mingling with the occasional cry\\nfrom a howler monkey. and once the sun falls, the air fills with\\nthe relaxing hum of thousands of insects.\\n\\nbut being in tulum, we couldn\\'t deprive ourselves of the water.\\ncenotes (pronounced se-no-tays) are underground pools of water that\\nwere worshiped by the ancient maya who saw them as portals to the\\nafterlife. the yucatan is virtually river-less, and cenotes provide\\ndrinking water as well as diversion, the result of rainwater\\nfiltering through porous limestone.\\n\\none of the most breathtaking is the grand cenote, just a few\\nmiles from the hotel on the modern highway to tulum. in a huge\\nnatural cavern, snorklers swam through crystal clear water and\\nunder tunnels covered with hanging stalagmites. far cooler and more\\nrefreshing than the ocean, the cenote was filled with hundreds of\\nsmall fish that darted between our legs.\\n\\nfor lunch we headed into downtown tulum, which has a decidedly\\nhippie and european vibe. unlike the mega-resorts of cancun, tulum\\nis mostly visited by younger, backpacker types staying at one of\\nthe many eco-hotels along the beach (most generate their own\\nelectricity through solar and wind power).\\n\\nseveral larger resort-style places have moved to tulum in recent\\nyears, but are embroiled in a lengthy legal battle with the\\ngovernment over environmental laws. several have been temporarily\\nshut down because they were built too large or in sensitive areas.\\n\\nthere is a large italian population in the mayan riviera, and as\\nan extra bonus, a high concentration of delicious, authentic\\nitalian restaurants. we ate at la nave along tulum\\'s main boulevard\\nand feasted a calzone the size of a small television and an\\nimpeccable seafood linguini stuffed with fresh shrimp, squid and\\noctopus.\\n\\nit would be criminal to leave tulum without visiting its\\nmajestic mayan ruins, built along a beach-side cliff. the ruins,\\nwhich once served as an important trading hub with what is now\\nbelize and guatemala, are best visited early in the morning. not\\nonly is the heat less oppressive, but you\\'ll avoid bus loads of\\ntourists. even though we visited during the rainy off-season,\\nhordes of mostly european tourists overran the place.\\n\\nthere\\'s a beach within the ruins where you can bodysurf among\\nancient temples, but unfortunately it was closed because of high\\nsurf when we were there.\\n\\nas the crowds made their way back to their beach-side hotels, we\\ndrove back into the jungle and considered two options: ride a zip\\nline through the jungle canopy or explore the ruins in coba.\\nhanging lazily in our hammock, suspended above the natural pool, we\\ndecided that nothing beat doing nothing.\\n\\nwhere to stay:\\n\\nla selva mariposa (www.laselvamariposa.com) has four rooms, one\\nof which is a larger suite. prices range from $125 per night for\\nthe smaller rooms to $225 for the larger suite. no credit cards\\naccepted and you must mail a deposit.\\n\\nwhere to eat:\\n\\nla nave, avenida tulum between orion and beta streets, offers\\nfresh baked italian breads, authentic pastas and delicious seafood;\\nrestaurant at the om hotel in tulum\\'s beach-side hotel zone is a\\ngreat place to eat while overlooking the ocean. the ceviche is\\nexceptional.\\n\\nwhat to do:\\n\\nswim and snorkel at grand cenote, about 2.5 miles from tulum on\\nthe tulum to coba highway (admission about $8); check out the tulum\\nruins just north of town along the beach (admission about $4); the\\ncoba ruins about 40 minutes from tulum is a chance to see ruins in\\na pristine jungle setting (admission about $4); you can zip line\\nthrough the jungle canopy with several outfits including\\nalltournative.com.\\n\\nhow to get there:\\n\\nroundtrip non-stop from miami to cancun $273 on mexicana; from\\natlanta $580 non-stop on aeromexico and $672 non-stop on delta;\\nfrom austin $310 non-stop on viva aerobus.\\n\\ntulum is about two hours south of cancun and reachable by bus,\\nalthough renting a car is the easiest way to get around. macario\\ngomez, home to la selva marioposa, is located 12 miles west from\\ntulum on the highway to coba.\\n\\njeremy schwartz\\'s e-mail address is jschwartzcoxnews.com.\\n\\nthe writing on the wall photos are being sent to nytns photo service subscribers. non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or 888-603-1036.      north adams, mass. - a few months ago, in a cavernous new\\ngallery space at\\nthe massachusetts museum of contemporary art, lacey fekishazy took\\nout a\\npencil and began to draw on a white wall.\\n\\nnobody bothered the brooklyn artist. after all, she was doing\\nher job,\\nwhich was to create a sol lewitt wall drawing. the subtitle - \"ten\\nthousand lines about 10\" (25cm) long, covering the wall evenly\" -\\npretty\\nmuch described the task. each day, ruler in hand, fekishazy added\\nto the\\npiece, 10 inches at a time.\\n\\n\"i have drawn 5,000 lines!!!!!!\" she wrote on a sheet of scrap\\npaper\\ntaped nearby after four days of work. when it was over, after day\\neight,\\nfekishazy spoke of the surprising pleasure she took from the\\nprocess, which\\nrendered the wall a mesmerizing sea of cross-hatched marks.\\n\\n\"i found it really meditative and calming,\" she said.\\n\\nthis month, the work of fekishazy and 68 others brought in by\\nmass moca\\nlast summer will open to the public: a sprawling, unprecedented\\nretrospective of the late lewitt\\'s wall drawings. this 105-work\\nproject,\\ncreated according to specifications set out by the conceptual\\nmaster,\\ncovers three floors, nearly 30,000 square feet, and four decades of\\nthe\\nartist\\'s work. mass moca\\'s building 7, formerly an abandoned mill\\nbuilding,\\nwas renovated especially for the show at a cost of roughly\\n$5million. the\\nexhibition, created through an unorthodox collaboration with the\\nyale\\nuniversity art gallery, williams college museum of art, and lewitt\\nestate,\\nwill remain up for at least 25 years, until 2033.\\n\\nfor lewitt fans, the project serves as a vast embrace of the\\nartist\\'s\\nlegacy and a new destination for a wall-drawing pilgrimage. for\\nthose less\\nfamiliar with lewitt, the installation is an eye-opening\\nintroduction,\\nshowcasing the dry humor of some of his early pencil drawings, the\\npulsating colors of his later paint and ink-wash creations, and the\\ndeceivingly complex textures and almost trompe-l\\'oeil quality of\\nhis final\\ngraphite works.\\n\\n\"what becomes clear is that sol was interested in making\\nbeautiful\\nthings,\" said mass moca director joseph c. thompson during a\\nrecent walk\\nthrough building 7. \"they\\'re exquisite. you can feel human touch\\nright\\nthrough them.\"\\n\\na maze of creation\\n\\nit is hard to stay in one place for long within the lewitt\\ninstallation.\\neach piece leads to another, every corner revealing the next\\nsprawling\\ncreation. you are drawn in, as if visiting a multihued version of\\nan\\nenglish hedge maze. at different moments, you\\'re surrounded by\\ngeometric\\nshapes, swirls, and blinding colors.\\n\\nbefore he died last year, lewitt designed the entire exhibit\\'s\\nlayout, with\\nnew internal walls that stand in contrast to the aged brick\\nstructure that\\nsurrounds them. he didn\\'t want stanchions keeping viewers away from\\nthe\\nworks - which, while making mass moca\\'s leaders a bit jittery,\\ncreates an\\nintimacy and flow for the show.\\n\\nwhy mass moca? for lewitt, a hartford native whose art has been\\nexhibited\\nat some of the most prestigious institutions around the world, from\\nnew\\nyork\\'s museum of modern art to london\\'s tate modern, mass moca\\noffered\\nsomething many other institutions could not: space. at 16 acres,\\nmass moca\\nhas the largest campus of any contemporary museum in the united\\nstates,\\nwith a series of buildings once occupied by the sprague electric\\nco.\\n\\njock reynolds, director of the yale university art gallery, was\\nkey to\\nmaking the connection. in 1993, reynolds, then director of the\\naddison\\ngallery of american art at phillips academy, staged an important\\nexhibit of\\nlewitt wall drawings. when the show ended the walls were\\nwhitewashed, as\\nwas typical for such a lewitt exhibition.\\n\\n\"there was a certain sadness, but i never felt a sense of\\ndesperation,\"\\nsaid reynolds by phone. \"i was quietly confident that we\\'d have\\nmore\\nchance to work together.\"\\n\\naround 2001, lewitt began treatments for the cancer that, six\\nyears later,\\nwould kill him. facing his mortality, the artist, whose sense of\\nartistic\\nadventure had always been matched by his playfully self-deprecatory\\nview of\\nhis own work, began to get serious. how, he wondered, would he\\nmaintain his\\nlegacy? the impermanent nature of his wall drawings, something he\\'d\\nencouraged, appeared in conflict with the notion of an archive.\\n\\nreynolds made a suggestion: what about mass moca? thompson, a\\nfriend of\\nreynolds, loved the idea. he hosted lewitt for a nearly six-hour\\nvisit in\\n2003. not long afterward, the artist sent along a proposal.\\n\\n\"we have space and time and access to interns and housing, and\\nwe make art\\nhere,\" said thompson. \"it was a good fit. sol\\'s response was that\\na good\\nidea like this would be hard to screw up.\"\\n\\nfollow directions\\n\\nlewitt began creating wall drawings in the late \\'60s. a response\\nto the\\ncolor-splashed pop art movement, the works were creations of\\ngeometric\\npossibility, with more than a splash of humor. the directions for\\ninstalling the pieces were generally in the subtitles. for example,\\n1970\\'s\\n\"wall drawing 56\" includes the following subtitle: \"a square is\\ndivided\\nhorizontally and vertically into four equal parts, each with lines\\nin four\\ndirections superimposed progressively.\"\\n\\nlewitt\\'s idea was that anybody could create the work by\\nfollowing\\ndirections. in this sense, he helped pioneer the conceptual notion\\nthat the\\nidea of an artwork is the most important aspect of the piece, not\\nits\\ntemporal manifestation. works would then be executed the way an\\norchestra\\nmight perform a symphony. and each time, a piece would not\\nnecessarily be\\nthe same. much depended on the technique, from how lightly or\\ndarkly lines\\nmight be drawn to an installer\\'s preferences following directions.\\nby\\ngiving his installers freedom, lewitt turned what could have been a\\npaint-by-the-numbers exercise into something more collaborative.\\n\\n\"the key to keeping you interested is the room that sol leaves\\nbetween the\\ninstructions and the complete piece,\" said tomas ramberg, a lewitt\\ninstaller for a decade who served as one of the leaders of the mass\\nmoca\\nproject. \"you get to sort of feel like you\\'re the one doing it.\"\\n\\nramberg described a typical working process with lewitt. \"we\\nwould get a\\nplan from sol and look at it and try to make sense of it,\" he\\nsaid. \"sol\\nwould see it and refine his description of what he was after.\" for\\nthe\\nlate-period pencil sketches, other than the shapes lewitt dictated,\\n\"the\\nonly thing he knew was he wanted scribble gradations from 0 to 6.\\nzero\\nbeing white and six being completely closed up.\"\\n\\nif lewitt didn\\'t like the result, he would offer more\\ninstruction, ramberg\\nrecalled: \"it needs to look more like corrugated steel,\" he might\\nsay.\\n\\ncreating the wall drawings can be mentally taxing. in the past,\\nramberg\\nsays, he has watched as installers left at the end of a day and\\nnever\\nreturned. that didn\\'t happen at mass moca. that\\'s partly because\\nthis\\nsummer, there was the camaraderie of the team. over the summer, as\\nwork\\nprogressed, the installers - all of them artists in their own right\\n- taped\\npages of humorous messages (\"attn:\" bugs, no dying on the wall!!!\\ntake\\nyour death elsewhere\") and r. crumb-like cartoons on the brick\\nwalls of\\nbuilding 7.\\n\\nthey shared rented apartments in town and blasted music in the\\nspace as\\nthey worked. nick kozak, a sculptor from the hudson valley, created\\nwall\\ndrawing 38, a three-panel piece that required rolling up dozens of\\n1-inch-long slivers of colored paper to be inserted into pegboard\\nholes.\\nhis secret weapon? breaks.\\n\\n\"it\\'s very relaxing in a way because you have an idea of what\\'s\\ngoing on\\nand what\\'s expected,\" he said. \"but you always need to take a\\nstep\\nback.\"\\n\\nor, as fekishazy said, \"on the most frustrating days, when it\\ngets hot and\\nthe colored leads can get soft and break, you at least know that\\nit\\'ll be\\nover someday.\"\\n\\nmany of the workers left in august, and the rest were gone by\\nthe end of\\nseptember. that left mass moca to get ready for the nov. 16 opening\\nand\\nsurrounding events.\\n\\ncomposer steve reich, a longtime lewitt friend, will be on hand\\nthe night\\nbefore, playing at a small private party for project supporters and\\nlewitt\\'s widow, carol.\\n\\nin a phone interview from new york, reich talked first of\\nlewitt\\'s\\ngenerosity toward others. the artist was famous for helping artists\\nand\\nmusicians who needed support. reich remembers lewitt coming to\\nvisit him in\\n1971, at a time when reich needed to purchase three glockenspiels,\\nwhich he\\ncouldn\\'t afford.\\n\\n\"sol said, \\'i\\'d like to buy one of your scores,\"\\' said reich.\\n\"i didn\\'t\\ndrop a beat, and said, \\'what would you like?\\' sol didn\\'t need my\\nscore. he\\njust decided he admired what i was doing and knew i could use the\\nhelp\\nfinancially.\"\\n\\nreich calls the mass moca project a \"fantastic undertaking.\"\\n\\n\"sol is a great artist of the 20th and 21st century, and wall\\ndrawings are\\none of his major contributions,\" he said. \"sol deserves it.\"\\n\\nthompson, the museum\\'s director, agrees. while touring the\\nspace, he showed\\noff his favorites, including \"wall drawing 880,\" a 70-foot-long\\nswirl of\\nintertwined bright green and orange.\\n\\n\"the edges buzz and vibrate,\" he said. \"as you look at it,\\nyour eyes\\nbegin to flicker. you can feel sol with his finger right in your\\nrib\\ncage.\"\\n\\nthompson said raising money for the lewitt project, not only for\\nthe\\nrenovation but for an archivist who will work out of yale and an\\nendowment\\nto operate building 7, was easier than he expected. he considers\\nthe\\nproject a model for other long-term, single-artist installations\\nthat mass\\nmoca might stage to augment the museum\\'s regular slate of changing\\nexhibits.\\n\\nwalking through the newly renovated space, thompson pointed\\nthrough a\\nwindow, across a courtyard, to building 6. abandoned long ago, it\\nsits\\nempty.\\n\\n\"there\\'s room right over there.\"\\n\\ngeoff edgers can be reached atgedgers@globe.com.\\n\\ntom stoppard thought he might write a play about a rock star\\nliving like a\\nhermit in suburbia. the inspirational recluse was syd barrett,\\nfallen\\ncofounder of pink floyd. the british playwright, a lover of music\\nand\\nchronicler of the intersection of personal and political identity,\\nbecame\\nfixated on two photos of barrett: one a beautiful young romantic,\\nthe other\\na thickset bald man pedaling home from the supermarket.\\n\\n\"the knowledge that they are the same person, or that one\\nperson turns\\ninto the other person, is something which i find affecting,\"\\nstoppard\\nsays. \"as usual with me, the play turned out to be about a lot of\\ndifferent thoughts i was having.\"\\n\\nspecifically, it took him to his native czechoslovakia during\\nthe pivotal\\nyears between 1968 and 1990. \"rock \\'n\\' roll,\" stoppard\\'s latest\\ntheatrical brain tickler, is a heady collision: of politics,\\npoetry, the\\nnature of consciousness, cancer, family dynamics, human spirit, and\\nyes,\\nrock \\'n\\' roll. yet the play isn\\'t without a throughline. near the\\nend, a\\nczech intellectual named lenka sits at a table in cambridge,\\nengland, with\\nan aging communist, a sappho scholar, and a music fanatic, among\\nothers,\\nand offers this tidy summation of the preceding hours and decades:\\n\"\\'make\\nlove, not war\\' was more important than \\'workers of the world\\nunite.\"\\'\\n\\nit would be foolhardy to reduce \"rock \\'n\\' roll\" to such a\\nsimplistic\\ncultural legacy. but lenka\\'s line is a window on what makes this\\nplay -

(drug-addled and mentally ill, barrett was booted out of\\npink\\nfloyd in 1968; he died a month after \"rock \\'n\\' roll\" opened in\\n2006.)\\n\\neven more integral to the plot is the plastic people of the\\nuniverse, a\\nczech band that became a symbol of resistance under the communist\\ngovernment during the 1970s. at the end of act i, when the young\\nczech\\nacademic jan finds his treasured record collection has been smashed\\nby the\\nauthorities, he says to his friend: \"it\\'s only rock \\'n\\' roll.\"\\n\\nfor stoppard, there\\'s a deeper sentiment, a creed for living,\\nreally, that\\ncourses beneath the feel-good surface of that cliche.\\n\\n\"rock \\'n\\' roll is a potent phrase for me,\" says the\\nplaywright. \"it\\'s\\nmuch more than a description of a certain kind of music. it also\\nhas\\nimplications of a certain kind of lifestyle, of wishing to live\\nmore freely\\nfrom the conventions of society. and when things go wrong it\\nimplies an\\nattitude of philosophical stoicism.\"\\n\\nthat spirit is the connective thread in \"rock \\'n\\' roll,\" as\\nstoppard\\nchronicles 22 turbulent years (bookended by the prague spring and\\nthe\\nvelvet revolution) in the life of max, a brilliant marxist\\nprofessor; his\\nmusic-obsessed protege jan; max\\'s cancer-stricken wife, eleanor, a\\ngreek\\npoetry teacher; and their daughter esme.\\n\\nlike jan, whom the author concedes is something of an alter-ego,\\nstoppard\\nwas born in prague, in 1939. his family fled to singapore, then\\nindia when\\nthe nazis invaded czechoslovakia; his father, who remained behind,\\nwas\\nkilled during the invasion. stoppard moved to england in 1946, when\\nhis\\nmother married a british army officer.\\n\\n\"if i\\'d gone back to czechoslovakia at the age of 8 i don\\'t\\nknow what kind\\nof life i would have had, but in one way jan\\'s could be considered\\na\\npseudo-autobiographical life i never had to live,\" stoppard says.\\n\\nfor that reason, and others, \"rock \\'n\\' roll\" is described by\\nmany as the\\nplaywright\\'s most personal work to date - a shift away from more\\nabstract\\npolitically themed works such as \"every good boy deserves\\nfavour,\" about\\na dissident imprisoned in a mental hospital; \"indian ink,\" which\\nexamines\\nbritish rule in india; and \"the coast of utopia,\" a trilogy about\\nthe\\norigins of modern political radicalism in 19th-century russia.\\n\\n\"as he gets older i think he\\'s thought a great deal more about\\nhimself,\\nwhat it means to come from that background, how he feels about\\nengland,\"\\nsays director carey perloff, widely considered to be stoppard\\'s\\nleading\\namerican interpreter and the artistic director at san francisco\\'s\\namerican\\nconservatory theater, with which the huntington collaborated on\\nthis\\nproduction. \"also about mortality and love, and what is constant\\nabout the\\nhuman heart. the things you think are going to be important turn\\nout not to\\nbe so important. things that look permanent disappear, like the\\nsoviet\\nunion. and things that seem transient, like a moment between a\\nyoung girl\\nand a man, last.\"\\n\\nand things that would by all logic be cast in stone - say, the\\nscript for\\na hit play - are not. stoppard and perloff tinkered with dialogue,\\nscene\\nstructure, the placement of music - over the phone, no less. they\\ntook a\\nscalpel to the ending.\\n\\n\"i have never heard of this,\" says huntington artistic\\ndirector peter\\ndubois. \"i have never heard of a writer revisiting a work after\\ntheir west\\nend and broadway premieres. it\\'s a testament to tom\\'s work ethic\\nand his\\nbelief that a play is a constantly evolving thing.\"\\n\\ninterestingly, stoppard describes the changes as\\n\"insignificant\" and\\nperloff calls the a.c.t./huntington production \"radically\\ndifferent.\"\\n\\n\"the main thing was the dynamics of bringing it to a close\\nwithout things\\nspilling over and getting lumpy,\" says stoppard. \"we had a long\\ndiscussion about whether to change \\'biscuit\\' to \\'cookie\\'. and the\\nproduction has a new design, thank goodness.\"\\n\\n\"who am i to tell tom stoppard to change his play?\" perloff\\nasks\\nrhetorically. but she reports that their relationship is built on\\nsuch a\\nfruitful history of collaboration and trust that the director felt\\nfree to\\nmake numerous (and well-received) suggestions, such as giving one\\ncharacter\\'s line to another, adding dialogue to clarify a veiled\\nexchange,\\nand making more pointed use of songs.\\n\\n\"music is the currency of jan and esme\\'s love. it\\'s their\\ncode,\" perloff\\nsays. \"it couldn\\'t just be casual. sometimes tom is very subtle\\nand buried\\nin those relationships and you really have to piece it together.\"\\n\\nstoppard\\'s plays are famously cerebral, and while \"rock \\'n\\'\\nroll\" is\\nperhaps the most sentimental of his works, it\\'s packed with ideas\\nand\\nreferences that may well elude the casual theatergoer. in the lobby\\nat the\\nrecent philadelphia production, playgoers could purchase a 60-page\\nglossary\\ncovering czech history, greek poetry, stalinist vocabulary, and\\ncartesian\\ndualism. the new york playbill included an insert explaining\\nplaywright and\\nformer czech president vaclav havel\\'s relationship with the plastic\\npeople\\nof the universe, a primer on marx and brain function, and a syd\\nbarrett\\nbio.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think i could actually rationalize how all the bits\\nfit together,\\nand i\\'m not really very interested in doing that,\" stoppard says.\\n\"theater is the event while it\\'s happening. it\\'s not really a\\ntext, except\\nin a secondary way, and if you were interested in writing a text in\\nwhich\\nthese different parts of the map were connected in some\\ninteresting,\\nintelligent way, then the text would be an essay and not a play.\\nthe thing\\nwhich really holds everything together is the personal narrative.\\nthe play\\ncan be described as a love story, principally, a love story in the\\ncontext\\nof all these other things.\"\\n\\nthat, notes perloff, makes \"rock \\'n\\' roll\" something\\ndistinctly\\nun-stoppardian: an everyman tale.\\n\\n\"sometimes people are scared of stoppard\\'s work because they\\nthink you\\nneed a phd to see it. although there\\'s a lot to learn, i think that\\nit\\'s\\nemotionally resonant enough that if you don\\'t know who ((the late\\nczech\\npolitician alexander)) dubcek is you can watch a young music-loving\\nintellectual struggle and a couple grapple with death and a\\nteenager grow\\nup in the shadow of her brilliant parents. anyone can connect to\\nthat,\"\\nperloff says. \"those are very human experiences.\"\\n\\nnot unlike the experience -

(ok, ok, a blizzard would have been worse. but you\\ncan\\'t physically start a game in a blizzard. you can, and they did,\\nstart a game last week in sleet that left it possible to play but\\nmade it impossible to play well.)\\n\\nwhy is the summer game played when the frost is on the pumpkin?\\nwhy does it take our candidates longer to get from new hampshire to\\nnew jersey than it takes other countries to nominate, campaign and\\nelect?\\n\\nthe answer is money and entertainment. big-league baseball,\\nwhich never had enough competent pitchers for 16 teams when that\\'s\\nall there were, expanded into any city willing to soak the\\ntaxpayers to build a stadium and become \"big-league.\" then it\\nneeded playoffs to keep interest alive longer, but that extended\\nthe season and made major league baseball more like a youth sports\\nleague where everyone gets a trophy.\\n\\ntwo more words: television contracts. with the premier games\\ndeep in football season, baseball has to play at times convenient\\nto the network, not to the \"realities of the game\" as barzun knew\\nthem. but the money is good, and the show must go on, so the\\nreality changes.\\n\\npoliticians are also part of a show. trapped in a doctor\\'s\\noffice, one could hear a cable network go from john mccain live to\\njoe biden live. neither said anything he hadn\\'t said the day before\\nand the day before that. crowds at obama\\'s and sarah palin\\'s\\nrallies are sprinkled with people whose behavior labels them as\\nfans, if not groupies. we have seen that before, though.\\n\\nwhen the campaigns began, mccain was for staying and surging in\\niraq, and obama stood for \"let\\'s go home.\" that was to be the\\nissue. all these months later, the surge has worked militarily but\\nfailed politically in baghdad, and the bush administration is\\ntalking about coming home. obama wanted to fight in pakistan, and\\nmccain didn\\'t want to talk about it in public. now, the bush\\nadministration fights in pakistan and talks about it.\\n\\nwhile babies were being born, learning to walk and starting to\\ndate, the campaigns droned on. last week, both candidates spoke as\\nif it were still two years ago and the economy still manageable.\\nthe reality of the economic game is that enormous changes are\\nhappening. when the senators plotted economic strategy, no one\\nwould have predicted that a republican administration would\\n\"invest\" in banks and an insurance company and talk about\\nabsorbing home mortgages and \"investing\" in failing auto\\ncompanies. it would not have been credible.\\n\\nit remains so incredible to a time-warped mccain that he throws\\nthe \"socialism\" spitball at his opponent even though the\\ncountry\\'s main commissar is a former goldman sachs chief whom\\npresident bush picked to run the treasury department.\\n\\nreality is that the baseball championship was decided in a game\\nthat started on tuesday and ended on thursday. the 2008 campaign\\nhas been so similar to that saga that you need to study one to\\nfigure out the other.\\n\\ntom blackburn is a former member of the palm beach post\\neditorial board. his e-mail address is tom underscore blackburn at\\njuno.com.\\n\\ncox news service\\n\\nq: we have a 1-year-old, 42-inch, 1080p panasonic plasma tv that\\nhas developed two horizontal \"rolling lines\" on the screen. our\\ntv worked fine until recently, when our cable company came out to\\ndo some work at our home, including the switching out of our hdtv\\ncable box. what can we do to fix this problem?\\n\\n-- doug calvert\\n\\na: there\\'s a strong chance there\\'s nothing wrong with your\\ntelevision. the cable installation almost certainly is to blame.\\nwhile it\\'s impossible to know for sure without checking out the\\ntelevision, you seem to be experiencing a well-known problem called\\nground loop.\\n\\nif you search google with the terms \"rolling lines tv\" you\\'ll\\nfind plenty of others in the same boat. the problem is caused by an\\nimproper ground for the cable system.\\n\\nyou\\'ll find some homebrew grounding solutions on the internet,\\nbut i strongly recommend you not try to fix the problem yourself\\nunless you are a trained electrician.\\n\\ninstead, call the cable folks and tell them you believe the\\ninstallation is not correctly grounded. if you\\'re lucky, they\\'ll\\nunderstand the ground loop problem. if not, your google search\\nshould give you enough background to explain the problem to a\\ntechnician.\\n\\nq: in one of your columns, you spoke of free ms office downloads\\nand named a site where it can be found. as is usual, i misplaced\\nthe article, so could you redirect me?\\n\\n-- r. shawn bennett\\n\\na:\\\\u2009it\\'s not a free microsoft office download, it\\'s a\\nprogram that performs the same functions -

he\\'s counted - that he\\'ll work\\n1.3\\nworkdays per week.)\\n\\nwe spoke to him by phone last week about the past and the\\nfuture.\\n\\nq. your voice on fox has been notable compared to other anchors.\\ni\\'ve\\nalways thought you sounded detached - not in the fray, but above\\nit.\\n\\na. well, i appreciate that thought. one of the people that i\\nused to look\\nat when he was in his heyday was roger mudd, and roger always had\\nthat\\nslightly amused, detached quality about him, and i always admired\\nthat. i\\ncan\\'t say i copied it, but as i\\'ve gotten older it becomes more of\\nthe way\\ni look at things. there\\'s really nothing new under the sun.\\nobviously it\\'s\\na new thing that we have an african-american so close to the\\npresidency,\\nbut you get down to the things he\\'s doing and talking about, the\\nideology\\n... it\\'s something i\\'m very familiar with.\\n\\nq. yet in this election, the pitch of the rhetoric seems angrier\\nand more\\nextreme than ever. do you attribute that to blogs? talk radio?\\n24-hour\\ncable?\\n\\na. to some extent it\\'s become more visible because of the\\naccelerated news\\ncycle and omnipresence of coverage. plus you have things that have\\nhappened\\nhere in washington that have contributed. when i was a reporter,\\n\"democratic congress\" seemed redundant. they\\'d had it over\\ndecades. i was\\nthere when the republicans controlled the senate for a few years\\nbut the\\nhouse ... it never seemed close to change. and then it did, and i\\nthink it\\nwas very difficult for democrats to stomach that. newt gingrich was\\na very\\npolarizing figure. after that was the impeachment of bill clinton.\\nand then\\nthere was the florida recount. then you have the war in iraq. you\\nadd all\\nthose things together and you get this brew of ingredients that\\ngives us\\nthis current atmosphere that is pretty polarized and pretty ugly.\\nit makes\\nnews but it\\'s disheartening.\\n\\nq. doesn\\'t the partisanship of the media outlets themselves\\ncontribute? you\\ncan now get your news filtered through a left- or right-wing lens.\\n\\na. you can do that if you want to. but i\\'m bound to say that the\\ndifference\\nwe have now is - i worked in the mainstream media for years as a\\ncorrespondent at abc news, i was there for 23 years. before that i\\nworked\\nfor newspapers. there was never any doubt in my mind, after i woke\\nup to\\nit, that the media tilted left. there\\'s a homogeneity of viewpoint\\nabout a\\nwhole range of issues. there\\'s an unspoken consensus about abortion\\nand the\\nenvironment and tax policy and the use of military force. now,\\nthere are\\nsome countervailing forces. there\\'s a blend in the media and more\\nof a\\nbalance.\\n\\nq. when you anchor on fox, do you see yourself as providing a\\nsort of\\nantidote to left-wing bias?\\n\\na. not quite. what i would say about fox news is that we saw the\\ncompetitive opportunity that was afforded us. ... strictly talking\\nabout\\nnews coverage now, there were two places we could look to run to\\ndaylight.\\none was stories that were legitimate, but they just were not being\\nemphasized or done at all. acorn: that\\'s a very good story, we had\\na free\\nrun with that for a couple of weeks before anyone got into it. and\\nthen\\nthere are stories that we develop in a different way than others do\\nit. it\\nis now a consensus in the media that the swift boat veterans for\\ntruth were\\na bunch of liars. what we found is that they were mistaken some of\\nthe time\\nand they were right some of the time. i think those are\\njournalistically\\nvalid approaches. sherrod brown, the democratic senator from ohio,\\nwas\\nsupposedly on the ((senate)) floor, talking about how hard it is\\ngoing be\\nfor bill o\\'reilly on election night when he has to report that\\nbarack obama\\nwon. but it\\'s not going be bill o\\'reilly. it\\'s going to be me.\\n\\nq. still, are you conscious, when you anchor, of trying to\\nperpetuate a\\nbalance?\\n\\na. i\\'m a conservative, but i was a reporter long before i was a\\nconservative, and i\\'m still a reporter first. and unless people\\nhave ideas\\nthat only liberals should be reporters, i would think they wouldn\\'t\\nhave\\nany problem with me. when i\\'m sitting in the anchor chair, i don\\'t\\nstate my\\nopinion, and i try very hard to be evenhanded.\\n\\nq. can we recover from this partisanship once the election is\\nover?\\n\\na. i don\\'t have any doubt there will be a honeymoon as there has\\nbeen in\\nthe past. now if the president comes stumbling out of the blocks\\nthe way\\npoor bill clinton did, the honeymoon won\\'t last very long. ((but))\\nbarack\\nobama, he\\'s a tremendously likable and appealing guy, and if he\\'s\\nelected,\\nmost americans will say, \\'give him a chance.\\' that\\'s the way\\namericans are.\\nand i think it\\'s a nice thing and a good thing. if he turns out to\\nbe as\\nmoderate in policy as he is in temperament, the honeymoon could\\nlast a long\\ntime.\\n\\njoanna weiss can be reached at

meals. and i wash and iron some clothes that once\\nwere sent to the dry cleaners.\\n\\nbut on rare occasions i allow myself a luxury or two. while few\\nof us can afford a rolls-royce or private jet, almost anyone - even\\na semi-retired newspaperman - can enjoy owning a top-of-the-line\\ngadget. there\\'s a joy in luxury.\\n\\nmaybe i\\'m fooling myself, but i think it can be practical, too.\\nthese rare flings with luxury make it easier for me to cut corners\\ncheerfully and live an economical life. there\\'s an even better\\nbenefit: high-end products often last longer, perform better and\\ncome from companies eager to stand behind their products. you won\\'t\\nalways save money over the long run, but in some cases the cost of\\nluxury may be less than it seems.\\n\\ntoday we\\'ll look at items that fit my definition of sensible\\nhigh-tech luxury. while these aren\\'t the most expensive gadgets\\navailable in their class, they represent the kind of quality money\\ncan buy.\\n\\ni can easily recommend any item described here, but that\\'s not\\nthe point. spend your luxury money on gadgets you crave, not the\\nones that fit my life. but here are some examples to get you\\nthinking.\\n\\nloud and clear\\n\\ni\\'ll start with my koss cobalt wireless headphones. it would be\\neasy to find wireless headphones for less than the $200 price tag.\\nbut the famed koss sound quality is especially impressive when you\\nconsider this set uses bluetooth technology to deliver audio with\\nno wires.\\n\\nno tinkering is required to get them going. the supplied audio\\ntransmitter plugs into the earphone jack of your sound system, mp3\\nplayer, or television. those with bluetooth-equipped cellphones can\\nalso use them.\\n\\nbut here\\'s what money really can buy. after using my headset for\\nmore than two years, it went on the fritz. i had never bothered to\\nsend in the warranty information. i called koss with low\\nexpectations, especially given the state of customer service in\\ngeneral.\\n\\nwhat a surprise! no warranty information? no problem. a\\n2-year-old gadget? that\\'s ok; there\\'s a lifetime warranty. the\\nu.s.-based customer service representative volunteered to send a\\nnew transmitter unit immediately along with a prepaid mailer to\\nsend the old one back.\\n\\npay more, get more\\n\\nin these days of $50 inkjet printers, i own one that costs 10\\ntimes that amount. i did a quick web search on prices for my canon\\ni9900 wide-format inkjet and found they start in the mid-$400s and\\nextended to $600.\\n\\nhere\\'s what i got for the money: my printer is now about 4 years\\nold and is still working fine. one of my hobbies is studio\\nphotography, and i\\'ve made 16-by-20 photographic prints that stack\\nup against what you\\'d get from a custom processor.\\n\\nit\\'ll do the routine chores, like cranking out letters and\\nprinting envelopes, but unless high-quality giant photographic\\nprints are important to you, it may well be a luxury that most\\ncould do without. but, for me, it\\'s a true joy.\\n\\niphone calling\\n\\nit would be impossible to talk about luxury gadgets without\\nmentioning the iphone. it is one of those rare products that\\nredefines technology. i don\\'t own an iphone but i\\'m anything but\\ntypical. i seldom even know where my cellphone is. i prefer to\\nremain out of touch.\\n\\nstill, i\\'ve been tempted to buy one just to own such a marvelous\\ngadget. when i\\'ve used the iphone, i marvel at the user-friendly\\nscreen and the built-in features, such as the way it uses gps and\\ncell towers to pinpoint your location. just as the first ibm pc\\ndid, this product will force other manufacturers to change how they\\nthink of cellphones.\\n\\nlike i said, this isn\\'t a shopping list but rather a rationale\\nfor occasionally splurging on top-end technology. for those of us\\ncutting back on spending, a few small splurges make the cut-rate\\ncoffee taste better and the time spent at the ironing board a\\nlittle more bearable.\\n\\nbill husted writes for the atlanta journal-constitution. e-mail:\\ntecbud at bellsouth.net.\\n\\na psychiatric patient\\'s

jonathan delman pelted through the forest\\n\"like a\\nbanshee, like there was no tomorrow.\"\\n\\nbehind him was mclean hospital in belmont, mass., where the\\nstaff wanted to\\nhold him against his will. another stay in a mental hospital, he\\nfelt,\\nwould unravel the life he had begun to put back together. he\\nzigzagged\\nbetween brush and trees to leave no clear tracks.\\n\\nthis was the climax in a series of psychiatric implosions that\\nhad landed\\ndelman in hospitals, driven away girlfriends, stymied his attempts\\nto find\\nwork as a lawyer, and left him feeling lost and often suicidal.\\nwhat kept\\nhim alive, he believes, was what powered that escape: \"grit and\\ndetermination against all odds.\"\\n\\nthat wild woodland run happened just about a decade ago. last\\nweek,\\ndelman received one of the nation\\'s most prestigious awards for\\ncommunity\\nhealth work: a $125,000 leadership prize from the robert wood\\njohnson\\nfoundation. the award honors people who \"conquer huge obstacles\\nand take\\ncommanding action in local communities\" on healthcare issues.\\n\\ndelman, who is 49 and lives in stoneham, founded and runs\\nconsumer quality\\ninitiatives, a groundbreaking boston agency staffed mainly by\\npeople with\\nmental illness. they survey other people who receive mental health\\nservices\\nfrom the state and analyze the data for ways to make improvements.\\nthe\\ngroup, for example, identified problems encountered by young people\\nwho\\n\"age out\" of the state\\'s mental health system for children, work\\nthat\\ncontributed to significant changes, including a $3 million program\\nto help\\nwith the transition to the adult system.\\n\\ngiven the stigma that mental illness still carries, and the\\ntraditional\\ndominance of academics in research, delman has had to fight long\\nand hard\\nfor his group to gain legitimacy, said marylou sudders, the former\\nstate\\ncommissioner of mental health, who has known delman since the\\nmid-\\'90s.\\n\\n\"if he ever has any doubt about himself, which he shouldn\\'t\\nhave, getting\\na robert wood johnson award is like the good housekeeping seal of\\napproval,\" she said.\\n\\ndelman\\'s bipolar disorder has not disappeared. he still takes\\nsix\\npsychiatric medications a day, three for sleep. but he has been\\nable to\\nbuild his recovery on two of the central pillars of many lives:\\nwork and\\nlove.\\n\\n\"it\\'s hard to recover from where i was - on social security\\ndisability,\\nwith serious mental illness, hospitalized numerous times, down in\\nthe dumps\\nand facing so many barriers,\" he said. \"i was able to overcome\\nthose\\nbarriers because of advantages in my life - family and education -\\nand my\\nown intense desire to overcome them, and finally, my loving\\nrelationship\\nwith my wife, and a job.\"\\n\\nall around him, delman said in an interview, he sees people in\\npositions\\nsimilar to his a decade ago caught in the catch 22 that because\\nthey have a\\nmental illness, they cannot get the work and support that would\\nhelp them\\novercome it. \"i see a lot of unrealized potential and it makes me\\nvery\\nsad,\" he said.\\n\\ndespite delman\\'s bipolar disorder, he graduated from tufts\\nuniversity summa\\ncum laude and from law school at the university of pennsylvania.\\nbut after\\nhis crises and hospitalizations began in his thirties, he found it\\nimpossible to get work as a lawyer, even when he was functioning\\nwell. he\\n\"came out\" as a person with mental illness in the mid-1990s, as\\nhe sought\\nto fight discrimination and educate others about their employment\\nrights.\\n\\naround that time, he met his future wife, deborah, who is also a\\nleading\\nmassachusetts advocate for people with mental illness. she had\\nmixed\\nfeelings about him, deborah delman said; he had not been working,\\nand as a\\nsingle mother, she could not support both him and her son, pete. as\\njonathan delman tells it, his temper also put her off.\\n\\nbut he was great with pete, and they worked shoulder to shoulder\\ntoward\\ntheir common causes for many months. one day, at a table at a\\nbickford\\'s\\nrestaurant in waltham, he was confessing his love for her - not for\\nthe\\nfirst time - and she reached across the table, tears welling up in\\nher\\neyes, and took his hand.\\n\\nto her own shock, she said, \"i love you.\"\\n\\n\"it was the greatest moment in my life,\" jonathan delman said.\\n\\nsince his mclean escape soon before they married, \"i have not\\nbeen back to\\na hospital,\" delman said. \"and i will never go back to a\\nhospital.\"\\n\\nbut what he learned as a psychiatric patient now informs\\ndelman\\'s work in\\nhelping others.\\n\\nfor example, he said, he experienced first-hand how arbitrary\\nrules or\\npetty cruelties by hospital staff can demoralize and alienate\\npatients.\\npatients can feel that if they complain, they risk retribution, and\\nnothing will change anyway.\\n\\nso when his agency began to survey psychiatric patients in\\nhospitals, it\\nasked about staff-and-patient interactions. it also asked about\\nother\\nissues that can deeply affect patients: were they treated with\\nrespect and\\ndignity? did they have needed privacy? did they have access to a\\ntelephone?\\n\\nor consider psychiatric medications. the antidepressant zoloft\\nhelped\\ndelman, but when he was hospitalized in the mid-1990s, he was\\nabruptly\\ntaken off it without being consulted, and put on another medication\\nthat\\nmade him physically ill. he felt like a zombie for months, until he\\nfinally\\nasked to be put back on his previous medications and greatly\\nimproved.\\n\\nthese days, consumer quality initiatives is working on a project\\nto give\\nconsumers decision-making tools to help them have more input into\\ntheir\\nprescriptions, including guidance on which websites have the best\\nmedical\\ninformation. some of his prize money will go toward that project,\\ndelman\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"a lot of the work jon has done has changed thousands of\\npeople\\'s lives in\\nmassachusetts, but they don\\'t know jon was part of it,\" said alisa\\nk.\\nlincoln, an associate professor of health sciences and sociology at\\nnortheastern university, who has worked with

health and\\nhuman services released its recommendations for physical activity,\\nstating that adults gain substantial health benefits from\\nperforming 2.5 hours per week of moderate aerobic exercise.\\n\\nchildren benefit from an hour or more of physical activity each\\nday, according to the new physical activity guidelines for\\namericans. the guidelines are designed so that physical activity\\nfits into a daily plan, and they encourage incorporating activities\\nthat are enjoyable.\\n\\nwe know that being active reduces risk of coronary heart\\ndisease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, stroke, colon\\ncancer, breast cancer and depression. it also improves\\ncardiorespiratory function and builds bone and muscle tissue while\\nburning excess body fat. regular physical activity also helps\\npeople with arthritis or other rheumatic conditions affecting the\\njoints.\\n\\nthe physical activity guidelines for americans are the most\\ncomprehensive of their kind and are based on the first thorough\\nreview of scientific research about physical activity and health in\\nmore than a decade.\\n\\nkey guidelines by group are:\\n\\nchildren and adolescents: one hour or more of moderate or\\nvigorous aerobic physical activity a day, including vigorous\\nintensity physical activity at least three days a week. examples of\\nmoderate intensity aerobic activity include hiking, skateboarding,\\nbiking and brisk walking. vigorous intensity aerobic exercise\\nincludes jumping rope, running and sports such as soccer,\\nbasketball, and ice or field hockey.\\n\\nit is recommended that children and adolescents incorporate\\nmuscle-strengthening activities, such as rope climbing, sit-ups and\\ntug-of war three days a week, and bone-strengthening activities\\nlike jumping rope, running and skipping three days a week.\\n\\nadults: substantial health benefits for adults can be gained\\nfrom 2.5 hours a week of moderate intensity aerobic physical\\nactivity, or one hour and 15 minutes of vigorous physical activity.\\nexamples of moderate intensity aerobic activities are brisk\\nwalking, water aerobics, ballroom dancing and general gardening.\\nvigorous intensity aerobic activities include racewalking, jogging\\nor running, swimming laps, jumping rope and hiking uphill or with a\\nheavy backpack. aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of\\nat least 10 minutes.\\n\\nfor more extensive health benefits, adults should increase\\naerobic activity to five hours per week if exercising at a moderate\\nintensity or two and one half hours weekly if the activity is\\nvigorous. adults should incorporate muscle-strengthening activities\\nsuch as weight training, push-ups, sit-ups and carrying heavy loads\\nor heavy gardening, at least two days per week.\\n\\nolder adults: older adults should follow recommendations for\\nother adults when they are physically able to do so. where a\\nchronic condition prohibits following these guidelines, older\\nadults should be as physically active as their abilities and\\nconditions allow. if risk of falling is an issue, this group should\\nalso do exercises that maintain or help to improve balance.\\n\\nwomen during pregnancy: healthy women should get at least 2.5\\nhours of moderate intensity aerobic activity a week during\\npregnancy and the time after delivery, preferably spread throughout\\nthe week. pregnant women whose habit it is to engage in vigorous\\naerobic activity or who are highly active can continue during\\npregnancy and after delivery, provided they remain healthy and\\ndiscuss with their health care provider how and when activity\\nshould be adjusted over time.\\n\\nadults with disabilities: those who are able to should get at\\nleast 2.5 hours of moderate aerobic activity a week or one hour and\\n15 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity weekly.\\nmuscle-strengthening activities involving all major muscle groups\\ntwo or more days a week should also be incorporated. if\\ncircumstances do not allow for meeting these guidelines, engaging\\nin regular physical activity according to abilities is recommended.\\n\\nindividuals with chronic medical conditions: regular physical\\nactivity provides important health benefits for adults who have\\nchronic conditions. individuals beginning an exercise program\\nshould do so with the guidance of a health care provider.\\n\\nfor more information, visit www.hhs.gov.\\n\\nmarjie gilliam is an international sports sciences association\\nmaster certified personal trainer and fitness consultant.

slightly more than three years, from september 1964 to\\njanuary 1968,\\n\"the man from u.n.c.l.e.\" had one of the giddier rides in\\nprime-time\\nhistory. it went from near cancellation to cultural phenomenon (and\\na brief\\nspot at no. 1 in the nielsen ratings). in the process it created a\\nspy\\nmania on network television. so great was the show\\'s popularity it\\neven\\ninspired a short-lived companion series, \"the girl from\\nu.n.c.l.e.\"\\n\\nsoon enough came self-parody and eventual cancellation. in its\\nthird\\nseason, \"u.n.c.l.e.\" didn\\'t just jump the shark. it pole vaulted\\nit. even\\nso, for those of a certain age, the names napoleon and ilya (as in\\nkuryakin, solo\\'s sidekick) aren\\'t much behind john, paul, george,\\nand ringo\\nin summoning up the onset of the \\'60s.\\n\\nlast month warner home video released \"the man from u.n.c.l.e.:\\nthe\\ncomplete series.\" it comprises all 105 episodes, on 41 dvds, with\\nan\\nadditional 10 hours of bonus features. completists will mourn the\\nabsence\\nof the 1983 tv movie, \"the return of the man from u.n.c.l.e.\"\\nwell, let\\nthem mourn. in the meantime, there is much explaining to do for the\\nuninitiated.\\n\\nin the hierarchy of \\'60s spy tv, \"u.n.c.l.e\" stood alone.\\n\"mission:\\nimpossible\" was too gimmicky, \"i spy\" too jokey, \"the wild,\\nwild west\"\\ntoo anachronistic. among \"u.n.c.l.e.\" scriptwriters were robert\\ntowne and\\nsci-fi master harlan ellison. richard donner directed four episodes\\nin 1964\\n(making solo and kuryakin the lethal weapons of their day). it\\'s no\\nwonder\\nquentin tarantino long spoke of making a movie version.\\n\\nrobert vaughn played solo. asked his opinion after reading the\\nscript for\\nthe pilot, he blurted out, \"it\\'s james bond for television.\" in\\nfact,\\nbond\\'s creator, ian fleming, had briefly assisted in creating the\\nseries.\\nhis sole contribution was the name of solo\\'s character: a dashing,\\ndebonair\\nsecret agent who looks good in a tux and is caviar to the ladies.\\nsound\\nfamiliar?\\n\\nthe unaired pilot (included in the dvd set) was called \"solo.\"\\nbond\\nreally was a solo operator, albeit with the inevitable supporting\\ncast of m\\nand q and moneypenny and the occasional appearance by cia agent\\nfelix\\nleiter (can\\'t forget the us market!). and solo was supposed to live\\nup to\\nhis isolating name. yet the beauty of the eventual title was the\\nbalance it\\nstruck between individual and organization\\n\\nu.n.c.l.e. stood for united network command for law and\\nenforcement. the\\norganization\\'s name simultaneously evoked uncle sam and the united\\nnations.\\nduring the show\\'s run, tourists frequently asked un guides for the\\nwhereabouts of u.n.c.l.e. headquarters. despite the weekly thanks\\noffered\\nto the organization in the show\\'s closing credits, it didn\\'t exist.\\nnor did\\nthrush, u.n.c.l.e.\\'s thoroughly nefarious rival operation.\\n\\nemphasizing the organization did two things - and they are\\neasily the two\\nbest things about the series. first, it played up leo g. carroll,\\nin the\\nrole of professorial spymaster alexander waverly, the head of\\nu.n.c.l.e. in\\na nice bit of foreshadowing, carroll had played a similar part in\\nalfred\\nhitchcock\\'s \"north by northwest\" (1959). his droll avuncularity\\nwas an\\nenormous asset.\\n\\neven better was david mccallum\\'s kuryakin. lizardy and vaguely\\nepicene,\\nvaughn\\'s solo had a slightly nasal voice and ever-present smirk.\\nthe\\noverall effect was one of effete chilliness. imagine a suave hugh\\nhefner\\ntrading in his pipe and pepsi for a walther p38. small wonder that\\nin\\nvaughn\\'s best-known film role, in \"bullitt\" (1968), he would be\\ncast as a\\nvillain.\\n\\nah, but where vaughn\\'s solo was chilly, mccallum\\'s kuryakin was\\ncool - very\\ncool indeed. if julie christie had the \\'60s\\' sexiest lower lip, as\\nshe most\\ncertainly did, then mccallum was a distant second. add in his blond\\nbangs,\\nhigh cerebral forehead, and penchant for dark turtlenecks, and a\\nteen idol\\nwas born. an air of distracted bemusement helped, too. when\\nkuryakin\\npretended to be the son of lawrence of arabia in a season two\\nepisode, it\\ndidn\\'t seem at all implausible. mccallum could have been peter\\no\\'toole\\'s\\nmore subdued scottish cousin. or oskar werner\\'s.\\n\\nmccallum received more fan mail than any actor in the history of\\nmgm, the\\nstudio that produced \"u.n.c.l.e.\" the show became the first\\nbeachhead of\\nthe \\'60s youthquake in prime time. it was a fluke. mccallum had all\\nof two\\nlines in the pilot. the producers quickly realized what genuine\\nchemistry\\nexisted between him and vaughn, a chemistry no less effective for\\nbeing\\nendothermic, and quickly built up the role. ilya and napoleon mixed\\ntogether like tonic water and gin.\\n\\n\"u.n.c.l.e.\" had its share of gimmicks. agents entered the\\norganization\\'s\\nheadquarters through the fitting room of a tailor shop. viewers,\\nlike\\nthrush, never thought to wonder what a skyscraper was doing behind\\na\\nstorefront.\\n\\nthere were gadgets, of course, most notably agents\\'\\nballpoint-pen\\n\"communicators.\" each episode was divided into four \"acts,\"\\nwhich\\nseemed sort of classy; and transitions denoted by blurry rapid\\npans, which\\nseemed very up to the minute. so did the fact of kuryakin\\'s being\\nrussian:\\nhe was a one-man precursor of d?tente.\\n\\nheavy on flutes and bongos, jerry goldsmith\\'s theme doesn\\'t\\nquite rank with\\njohn barry\\'s for the bond movies or lalo schifrin\\'s for \"mission:\\nimpossible\" (schifrin would be called in to reorchestrate the\\n\"u.n.c.l.e.\" theme for the second season). but it holds up\\nsurprisingly\\nwell.\\n\\nthe guest stars are a fascinating bunch, if not always for the\\nright\\nreasons. seeking to cash in on mccallum\\'s youth appeal, the\\nproducers\\nbrought in the likes of sonny &amp;amp; cher and nancy sinatra - who sang a\\nduet\\nwith mccallum. more common were fading movie stars: janet leigh,\\nvincent\\nprice, eleanor parker, george sanders. most memorably, joan\\ncrawford\\nconcluded season three getting slapped around by herbert lom. maybe\\nhe\\npreferred wire hangers?\\n\\nmost guests came from a stable of \\'60s tv standbys: ricardo\\nmontalban, june\\nlockhart, jack lord, victor buono, robert culp, leslie nielsen.\\nspotting\\ntheir overexposed faces is like a nick at nite version of \"where\\'s\\nwaldo.\"\\n\\nsometimes familiarity breeds amazement rather than contempt.\\nyes, that\\nreally was william shatner and leonard nimoy making a joint guest\\nappearance two years before the debut of \"star trek.\" martin\\nlandau,\\nlooking ahead to \"ed wood jr.,\" played a villain who dresses up\\nlike\\ndracula. a matinee-idol slender rip torn opened season two toasting\\nmarshmallows and bellowing, \"it\\'s not so simple to conquer the\\nworld today\\nas it was in the days of alexander

seeing is believing? seeing is (ital) confusing,\\n(endital) or\\nit can be. the whole point of \"first doubt: optical confusion in\\nmodern\\nphotography,\" which runs at the yale university art gallery\\nthrough jan.\\n4, is to demonstrate this basic fact of our visual existence. it\\ndoes so\\nwith nuance, variety, and skill. \"first doubt\" is the rare\\nhigh-concept\\nshow that manages to be smart without preening over its smartness.\\n\\nphotography puts a frame around the world. \"first doubt\" aims\\nto remind\\nus how arbitrary that frame can be. drawn from the collection of\\nyale\\ngraduate allan chasanoff, the show consists of images that present,\\nas he\\nputs it, \"a dislocation in the usual.\"\\n\\nthat dislocation can take many forms: cropping, foreshortening,\\nmirroring,\\nextreme close-ups, unusual perspectives, superimposed planes,\\nunfamiliar\\nsubjects, incongruous juxtaposition. it does not take the form of\\ndarkroom\\nmanipulation. the 114 images in the show are all examples of\\nstraight\\nphotography - which makes for that much more upending of\\nexpectations.\\n\\ndislocation can mean revelation. \"first doubt\" underscores\\nsomething we\\ngenerally prefer to ignore: how often what is visually transparent\\ncan be\\nconceptually opaque. each specific element in raghubir singh\\'s\\n\"pavement\\nmirror shop, howrah, west bengal\" is clear as glass, yet viewed as\\na whole\\nit\\'s pure puzzlement. the title explains all.\\n\\nstillness is no small part of the artifice of still photography.\\nmany times\\nit\\'s motion that provides resolution in figuring out what\\'s before\\nour\\neyes. for example, all we\\'d need is the slightest bit of follicular\\nflapping in jessica raimi\\'s \"liz on piermont pier\" to realize\\nthat what\\nthe image presents is a long-haired woman\\'s head on a windy day.\\n\\nthere\\'s one famous photograph in the show, william klein\\'s \"gun\\n1, new\\nyork (103rd st. and broadway).\" you\\'ve likely seen it: grimacing\\nkid\\nthrusts toy gun into camera lens while buddy calmly looks on in\\nprofile.\\nthe rest are relatively unfamiliar, even if many of the\\nphotographers\\naren\\'t (ansel adams, bill brandt, imogen cunningham, walker evans,\\nrobert\\nfrank, the list goes on). such unfamiliarity makes perfect sense.\\nfame is a\\nconcomitant of familiarity, and optical disorder is something the\\neye tends\\nto avoid.\\n\\nit\\'s true that part of what makes lee friedlander \"lee\\nfriedlander\" is\\nhow unconventionally he can array subject matter (his shadow on the\\nblonde\\'s back; the reflection of mount rushmore, rather than\\nmountain\\nitself, in front of camera-toting tourists). yet the play of\\npicture planes\\nand tension between continuity and disruption in the friedlander\\npicture\\nhere, \"england,\" are so ambiguous that that surely helps account\\nfor it\\'s\\nbeing one of his lesser-known works.\\n\\nyou\\'d expect aaron siskind to be included (\"acolman 2\"), with\\nhis\\nfondness for eccentric surfaces seen in minute detail, or even\\nandre\\nkertesz (\"steps of touraine\"), with his poet-geometer\\'s taste for\\nthe\\ntango of angles and planes. but a photojournalist like gilles\\nperess\\n(\"victims of shah and cia on a signboard at the us embassy,\\nteheran\")? or\\nlewis hine?\\n\\nthe hine photo is a full-body portrait of man standing in front\\nof the\\ncamera. what could be plainer? nothing, except it\\'s not the\\nplainness that\\ncauses confusion. the man is an amputee, but because he seems\\notherwise\\nhealthy and a sleeve covers his stump we keep trying to account for\\nthe\\nlack of bilateral symmetry. by the same token, the overhead\\nperspective\\nwith which herbert bayer took \"xanti schavinksy in a handstand\\nposition\"\\nmakes it look as though the subject\\'s disembodied legs are emerging\\nfrom a\\nwall. it\\'s a spooky sight, like something out of cocteau\\'s\\n\"orphee.\"\\ninstead, it\\'s an acrobat, as the title informs us.\\n\\nthat\\'s assuming the viewer has a title to read. this happens to\\nbe a show\\nwhere there\\'s no peeking at the labels. there aren\\'t any. rather\\nthan a\\nlabel, each photograph has next to it a number, which can be looked\\nup on a\\nchecklist. there\\'s a big stack of them by the entrance. as a result\\nof this\\nvery sly move on the part of curator joshua chuang viewers revert\\nto the\\nstatus of children. again and again, the old sleeve-tugging\\nquestions\\narise: \"what is it?\" \"how did they do that?\" sophisticated\\nmuseumgoers\\n(who know to peek at the label!) can readily provide answers. not\\nhere.\\nreference and evaluation must defer to instinct and guesswork. this\\nis not\\nnecessarily a bad thing.\\n\\nmark feeney can be reached at mfeeney@globe.com.\\n\\nfall river, mass.- not three weeks after the state commander of\\nthe\\nsalvation army tearfully asked his

president of the food bank, which supplies food\\nto 600\\nhunger-relief agencies and food pantries, including some salvation\\narmy\\nbranches.\\n\\nbetween last october and may, the number of people turning to\\nthe salvation\\narmy for help with food or energy bills soared; in framingham,\\nrequests\\nwere up 66 percent, in hyannis 47 percent, and in milford 48\\npercent.\\ngreenfield experienced an eye-popping 86 percent spike.\\n\\nthe latest data are even more alarming: cambridge served twice\\nas many\\npeople in the soup kitchen this september as it did last september,\\nand\\nthe number of families seeking help during the same period swelled\\nfrom 117\\nto 145.\\n\\nthe high food prices that are squeezing consumers are squeezing\\nrelief\\norganizations as well. last year, the food bank bought thanksgiving\\nturkeys\\nfor 77 cents a pound. this year, the price soared to $1.06.\\n\\nconcerned about raising enough money to meet the demand,\\nsalvation army\\nbell-ringers will put out their kettles earlier than usual\\nstatewide for\\nthe first time - beginning nov. 12 - in the hopes of restoring\\nchristmastime donations that slipped 8 percent last year and are\\nexpected\\nto drop further as larger donors and private foundations face their\\nfinancial losses for the quarter.\\n\\n\"we\\'re hoping at the very least to stay flat. but even if

for\\nher\\nhusband\\'s job, as well as sheer embarrassment.\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t want any of my neighbors seeing me coming over\\nhere,\" said the\\nwoman. \"my husband wouldn\\'t even come in with me ... i wouldn\\'t\\neven\\nconsider letting my son know.\"\\n\\nher chief concern is keeping the condo her family bought early\\nthis year\\nfor about $190,000 - a mortgage her husband\\'s salary can pay. but\\nsince the\\nwoman left an untenable workplace - and has been unable to find\\nanother job\\n- she no longer has enough money for utilities, gas, and food. a\\n$500\\ndeductible for repairs

thanksgiving\\ndistribution is 400 turkeys short - and officers are warning senior\\ncitizens who expected to pick up turkey dinners that the meals will\\nbe\\nreserved for those who have families to feed. seniors without\\nchildren or\\ngrandchildren will have to go to group thanksgiving dinners\\ninstead.\\n\\nwhether the organizations will be able to raise enough money to\\nmeet the\\nincreasing need is an open question. a report by giving usa\\nfoundation\\nreleased in september found that during recessions or economic\\nslowdowns,\\ncharitable giving slows - but does not

tightly shut as he speaks, as though trying to\\nread his\\nthoughts on the back of his eyelids.\\n\\nand this is one of his good days. kaufman is in town to promote\\n\"synecdoche, new york,\" - actually, that sentence is unusual in a\\nnumber\\nof ways. the film, which opens in boston on friday, is the\\nacclaimed\\nscreenwriter\\'s first foray behind the camera, after having penned\\nhead-spinning meta-dramas like \"being john malkovich,\"\\n\"adaptation,\"\\nand \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,\" the last earning him\\na best\\noriginal screenplay

\"synecdoche\" stars philip seymour\\nhoffman as\\nanother of kaufman\\'s cosmically miserable artist heroes, this one a\\ntheater\\ndirector who re-stages his own life in a downtown warehouse.

because i want the audience\\nto have\\ntheir experience of it, and if i say \\'this is what it means,\\' then\\nyou\\ncan\\'t have that. i\\'m giving them permission to have their own\\nexperience.\\n\\nq. most moviegoers resist that, though. they\\'re afraid of making\\na mistake.\\n\\na. but you can\\'t make a mistake, and that\\'s what i try to tell\\npeople. this\\nis your movie now. i\\'m done with it. take it, leave it, interact\\nwith it.\\nit\\'s yours to do what you want with, and you can\\'t possibly be\\nwrong.\\n\\nq. in a way, subjectivity is the subject of the film.\\n\\na. it\\'s the subject of the film, but the film\\'s also a metaphor\\nfor how\\npeople live their lives - how people project onto the world a story\\nabout\\nthis very messy, confusing non-story world. because of how the\\nhuman mind\\nworks, we organize life into these stories and cast people as\\ncharacters\\nand understand their motives and tell ourselves why they\\'re

a set and directing, which is the opposite\\nof\\nsolitary?\\n\\na. i think you\\'ve just said it all. (laughs)\\n\\nq. how does it feel in practice?\\n\\na. i like writing but it\\'s very lonely sometimes, and it\\nrequires a lot of\\ndiscipline. it\\'s the opposite of pragmatic, and directing is\\nenormously\\npragmatic. it\\'s also very structured. i mean, ((as a director))\\nevery\\nmoment i know exactly where i\\'m supposed to be, and if i forget\\nthere\\'s\\nsomeone there to tell me. and it\\'s managerial, so i have to figure\\nout how\\nto talk to people on an individual basis. it\\'s not like there\\'s one\\nway to\\ntalk to actors; they\\'re all different. i also have to let go of my\\nnatural\\npersonality traits, which are sulking and moodiness, and kind of\\nbecome an\\nadult, because that\\'s required.\\n\\nq. you have to be the designated adult in the room.\\n\\na. i do, and i\\'m not allowed not to be. in some ways it\\'s like\\nbeing a\\nparent. i don\\'t mean that in a condescending way, but simply that\\nif you\\nhave a child you have to hold it together. so that was my\\nresponsibility\\nand i did it. it was easier in the mornings. the days which ran\\nvery, very\\nlong, for the first 10 hours i could do it very well, and then once\\ni\\nstarted to get tired, i wanted to go somewhere and have a fit. and\\ni\\ncouldn\\'t. that was sort of a regular occurrence.\\n\\nq. how far back have you been interested in writing these\\nnonlinear boxes\\nwithin boxes? when did you start writing, for lack of a better\\nword,\\nrecognizably charlie kaufmanesque works?\\n\\na. i remember reading \"six characters in search of an author\"\\nin high\\nschool and being amazed that this had been written. at the same\\ntime there\\nwas stuff like monty python and national lampoon in the \\'70s,\\nionesco,\\nstuff that questioned what we accept as reality, sometimes in a\\nvery comic\\nway. at the time i was mostly thinking about comedic things.\\n\\nq. you were at boston university for a while.\\n\\na. i was in the acting program at bu. i had grown up wanting to\\nbe an\\nactor, and i decided suddenly, during my freshman year, that it\\nembarrassed\\nme. i left and went to nyu film school to study production. it was\\nbasically a giant workshop. i wrote this script which took place\\nover one\\nnight about an insomniac trying to go to sleep. it\\'s actually not\\nthat\\ndifferent from some of the things i would write now. it was fairly\\nexperimental in terms of structure, and the professor really loved\\nit. i\\nremember my classmate was chris columbus, and the professor held up\\nour two\\nscripts as shining examples of really great writing, but at the\\nsame time\\nrecognizing they were polar opposites. and of course chris went off\\nto\\nbecome enormously successful immediately, and i couldn\\'t get a job\\nfor 11\\nyears after graduating. i answered phones that whole time.\\n\\nq. i\\'m assuming you wrote \"malkovich\" on spec. how much\\nresistance was\\nthere to it?\\n\\na. no one wanted to make it. i didn\\'t write it to be made, i\\nwrote it\\nthinking maybe it would get me assignment work. but i was told that\\nit\\nwould never be made.\\n\\nq. by whom?\\n\\na. by everybody. people would tell me they loved it, they\\nthought it was\\nhysterical, they had it on their bedside table and read it a lot,\\nbut it\\'ll\\nnever be made. and for a couple of years that seemed to be the\\ncase, and\\nthen spike jonze read it and wanted to make it, and he was in a\\nposition to\\nbe able to.\\n\\nq. why did you set the new film in schenectady? because of the\\nwordplay\\nwith \"synecdoche\"?\\n\\na. no, i don\\'t think so. ((pause)) i don\\'t know why.\\n\\nq. as you\\'re writing all these different female characters, are\\nyou\\nconsciously creating aspects of women or are they popping up more\\norganically?\\n\\na. they\\'re based on people that i know, or parts of people that\\ni know, or\\nideas about relationships that i wanted to explore. and then as it\\nevolves,\\nthey start to make sense to me and i like them, so i continue in\\nthat\\ndirection. it\\'s more of an intuitive process than a calculated\\nprocess.\\n\\nq. do some of the characters take on lives of their own?\\n\\na. well, i think that they always do. you don\\'t know how to\\nwrite dialogue\\nfor claire at first, and then you start to realize what she sounds\\nlike and\\nit becomes easier to write her. that happens with everybody. it\\nbecomes so\\nthat you can actually have a conversation almost in real time\\nbetween\\ncharacters.\\n\\nq. who is ellen bascomb?\\n      a. what do you mean?\\n      q. who is ellen bascomb?\\n      a. ... what do you mean?\\n      q. isn\\'t she the cleaning lady?\\n      a. yeah.\\n      q. we never see her, do we?\\n      a. uh-uh.\\n      q. ok. so who is she?\\n\\na. what do you mean? (laughter) i don\\'t know who she is! she\\'s\\nsomeone who\\nmay or may not exist. obviously she never comes to do her job, so i\\nguess\\nthat brings her existence into question. but i don\\'t know if she\\nexists.\\n\\nq. sorry, that\\'s my one \"what does it all mean\" question.\\n\\na. i read this anecdote about a classical composer who played a\\npiano piece\\nand somebody asked him, \\'what does it mean?\\' and he sat down and\\nplayed it\\nagain. that\\'s what people do - they want to impose a meaning or a\\nstructure\\nonto what is what it is.\\n\\nq. well, it\\'s also that \"synechdoche, new york\" comes to us in\\nthe form\\nof a commercial movie, with movie stars. it\\'s not like it\\'s hanging\\nin a\\nmuseum, where a museumgoer would bring different expectations to\\nbear on\\nit.\\n\\na. but that\\'s exactly the example that i use. it is to me like\\nthe\\ninteraction that i have with a painting at a museum. most of the\\ntime\\nthere\\'s no verbal thing going on but it can be incredibly moving. i\\ndo\\nconsider this an art form, and my goal is to treat it that way. i\\ndon\\'t\\nknow if there\\'s a market for that. i guess we\\'ll find out. i\\'ll\\ntalk about\\nthe movie, but i\\'m not going to tell people to go see it and i\\'m\\nnot going\\nto tell them what it\\'s about. i don\\'t want to trick people into\\ngoing to\\nsee it.\\n\\nq. that\\'s my job.\\n\\na. well, i\\'ll leave you to it, then.\\n\\nty burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com. for more on\\nmovies, go to\\nwww.boston.com/ movies.\\n\\nthe chance of two

life in rural haiti doubly unlucky. he\\nwas born\\nwith a rare deformity, a hole in his skull that let his growing\\nbrain bulge\\noutward into a lump between his eyes as big as half a tennis ball.\\nand an\\neven larger cyst, swelling unseen inside his brain, threatened to\\nsuppress\\nhis vital functions and kill him.\\n\\nbut when he was just a few months old, dumanel\\'s luck began to\\nchange. many\\nin his family held old folk beliefs about health: they thought\\ndumanel\\'s\\nlump might have been caused by his mother\\'s cravings during\\npregnancy, or\\nan evil spirit. but his father, almane, believed in christianity\\nand\\nwestern medicine. he sold his only two cows to seek the best\\npossible help\\nfor his son.\\n\\na 14-hour bus-ride from their dirt-floored house last march\\nbrought the two\\nto a hospital in the town of hinche. it lacked all but the simplest\\nmedical\\ninstruments, but operation smile and partners in health, both\\nnonprofits\\nfamed for providing free health care to poor people around the\\nworld, were\\nsponsoring a special clinic for cleft-lip patients that week.\\n\\ndr. john meara, chief of plastic surgery at children\\'s hospital\\nboston,\\nhappened to be volunteering when dumanel arrived and easily\\nidentified the\\nlump that would have mystified most doctors. it was called an\\nencephalocele\\n(en-sef-a-lo-seel). he had treated them in australia, even written\\npapers\\non them. they were not just unsightly, they were dangerous. dumanel\\nneeded\\nmajor brain surgery.\\n\\n\"we can\\'t do this here,\" he said.\\n\\npartners in health handled the red tape; children\\'s donated\\nmoney, time,\\nand venue. on aug. 21, dumanel lay at children\\'s on one of the\\nhighest-tech pediatric operating tables in the world as meara and\\ncolleagues, working for free, re-engineered his brain and skull in\\na\\nconcert of neuro- and plastic surgery. only in the last few years\\nhas such\\na complex operation become feasible, he said.\\n\\nwhat once would have taken 24 hours was over in eight, and\\ndumanel was out\\nof the intensive care unit a day or so later. now, he bears a\\nscalloped\\nline of faint scars around his head and a light line across his\\nnose, but\\nhe is crawling and pulling himself up on chairs to stand like any\\nnear-toddler and has moved on from \"ooohh,\" his only sound before\\nthe\\noperation, to \"da da\" and \"ma ma.\"\\n\\non tuesday, dumanel and his father will leave to return home to\\ntheir small\\nfarming community on haiti\\'s central plateau.\\n\\n\"now he can start on his road in life,\" luxama said gratefully\\nduring a\\nrecent follow-up visit to children\\'s.\\n\\ndumanel is one of only about a dozen haitian children who have\\nbeen brought\\nto the united states for surgery this year, said dr. david walton,\\na\\npartners in health physician who helped get dumanel to boston.\\n\\n\"there are literally hundreds and hundreds of these kids out\\nthere,\" many\\nwith congenital heart defects whose problems are never detected\\nuntil it is\\ntoo late, he said; others are diagnosed but still die of diseases\\nthat\\ncould be treated with surgery. haiti has the highest infant\\nmortality rate\\nin the western hemisphere: 62 out of every 1,000 live births.\\n\\nmeara emphasized that while dumanel, of course, benefited from\\nhis medical\\ncare, so did the doctors who provided it: his case offered trainees\\na\\nvaluable opportunity to learn about the care of a rare anomaly and\\nobserve\\nskills and strategies that can be applied in future complex cases.\\n\\n\"it\\'s good at both ends of the airplane,\" he said. \"it\\'s\\nreally\\nimportant to have these kinds of cases\" at an institution of top\\nspecialists like children\\'s, \"so when the next case comes along,\\nclinicians have the experience and knowledge\" to handle it.\\n\\ndumanel\\'s surgery involved several procedures, each one of which\\nwould be\\nconsidered a major operation, said children\\'s neurosurgeon ed\\nsmith. \"it\\nwas a real skullbuster - no pun intended - to put together the\\nsteps and\\nsequence of events,\" he said.\\n\\nit was the encephalocele that brought dumanel to boston, but\\nonce he\\narrived, a routine brain scan showed that the right side of his\\nbrain had\\nbeen all but taken over by an arachnoid cyst, a great bubble of\\nfluid\\nsurrounded by spider web-like tissue that normally lines the brain\\nto\\nprotect it.\\n\\nhis doctors \"got the scan and said, \\'holy moly, this is not\\nwhat we were\\nexpecting at all!\"\\' walton said.\\n\\nsmith and meara first had to decide whether to operate on the\\ncyst and the\\nencephalocele at the same time. the entire neurosurgery department\\ndiscussed it, meara said, and decided it made sense.\\n\\nsmith went first, to tackle the fluid-filled cyst. imagine, he\\nsaid, a big\\nballoon, \"filled with water and plopped in the kitchen sink,\"\\nblocking\\nthe drain. \"what we did was cut the dome of the balloon away, so\\nthere was\\na big pop and the fluid came out, but there is still rubber sitting\\nover\\nthe drain at the bottom of the sink.\"\\n\\nthe fluid couldn\\'t drain away without a second step. using a\\nmicroscope to\\nmake sure he was preserving important tiny parts of dumanel\\'s\\nbrain, such\\nas the optic nerve, he created a new drainage system so fluid could\\nflow\\nproperly down into the brain stem and spinal cord\\'s drainage\\npathway.\\n\\nthen meara and smith focused on the encephalocele, cutting away\\nthe pale,\\nnon-functional brain tissue that bulged out of dumanel\\'s face and\\nrepairing\\nthe dura, the brain\\'s lining. with the lump gone, meara had to\\nrebuild\\ndumanel\\'s skull. he moved pieces of it around and fit them together\\nlike an\\nanatomical jigsaw puzzle. he created a nasal bone and new forehead\\nbone\\nfor dumanel where the encephalocele hole had been and moved\\ndumanel\\'s eye\\nsockets closer together.\\n\\nwhere gaps remained, he filled them in with fragments of bone.\\nin this, a\\nbaby\\'s skull is far superior to a jigsaw puzzle: once the pieces\\nare in\\nplace, they will eventually fuse together into a smooth whole. in\\nolder\\npatients, there is no such fusing.\\n\\nin general, dumanel\\'s risk for complications was high, from a\\nsurgical\\nglitch to an infection. but smith and meara sound like they are\\npinching\\nthemselves as they report on dumanel\\'s health to date. \"i\\'m just\\npleased\\nas punch with how he\\'s done,\" smith said. \"i\\'m hopeful that he\\nwill have\\nfully normal function as a completely normal kid when he grows\\nup.\"\\n\\ndumanel\\'s left side remains slightly weak from the cyst, but\\n\"i\\'m sure\\nwith some therapy, he\\'ll be fine,\" said dr. hermide mercier, who\\nhas been\\nhosting dumanel and almane at her brockton home as dumanel\\nrecovers.\\n\\n\"he\\'s moving more than he used to,\" she said. \"now he\\'s all\\nover the\\nhouse, pulling himself up. that\\'s a big change.\"\\n\\n\"da da da!\" said dumanel, who turned 1 in september. \"ba!\"\\n\\nalmane, 27, has been calling dumanel\\'s mother, louisinette,\\nevery day, he\\nsaid, \"and she practically shouts, \\'come home!\"\\' dumanel is the\\ncouple\\'s\\nonly child.\\n\\nlast wednesday, meara checked over dumanel for the last time and\\nbegan to\\narrange for follow-up care through partners in health\\'s haiti\\nclinics.\\n\"when you want to go home,\" he told almane in spanish, their\\ncommon\\nlanguage, \"it\\'s possible.\"\\n\\nalmane looked upward: \"i thank god first,\" he said, and then\\nlooked at\\nmeara, \"and you second.\"\\n\\nalmane hopes dumanel will grow up to help him work on his leased\\nfarm,\\nwhere he raises rice, corn, and potatoes.\\n\\n\"before, he couldn\\'t do anything,\" almane said, \"now, he can\\ndo what he\\nwants.\"\\n\\ncarey goldberg can

canal\\nsuddenly seems appealing.\\n\\n\"americans in particular are just very squeamish about dealing\\nwith\\ncolorectal issues,\" said dr. sapna syngal, a gastrointestinal\\ncancer\\nspecialist at boston\\'s dana-farber/brigham and women\\'s cancer\\ncenter. not\\nonly do they avoid the screening, they avoid the topic. \"you\\nwouldn\\'t talk\\nabout it at the cocktail party,\" she said.\\n\\nunless, of course, it\\'s to tell your middle-age pals that they\\ncould avoid\\nsome of the poking and probing of a traditional colonoscopy by\\nopting for a\\nvirtual version of the test - a high-tech x-ray of the belly that\\nis\\ndesigned to provide identical information.\\n\\nafter years of study, virtual colonoscopies appear closer than\\never to\\nwidespread adoption, with a federal advisory panel scheduled later\\nthis\\nmonth to review evidence on the test, a review that could prove\\npivotal as\\nhealth plans decide whether to pay for the screening.\\n\\nthere\\'s widespread agreement that virtual colonoscopies track\\ndown the most\\ndangerous polyps - the harbingers of cancer - just as well as the\\nmore-invasive test.\\n\\n\"i may get tarred and feathered for this, but i\\'m actually\\npretty\\nenthusiastic about the potential\" of virtual colonoscopy, said dr.\\npatrick\\nlynch, a gastroenterologist at m.d. anderson cancer center in\\nhouston. \"it\\nhas tremendous promise as a screening tool, so long as a few ifs,\\nands, or\\nbuts are taken into account.\"\\n\\ntwo major concerns linger. one is the exposure to radiation that\\ncomes with\\nany x-ray. another is whether the extra images generated by the\\nvirtual\\ntest - pictures of the kidney, liver, and pancreas - could lead to\\nunnecessary testing.\\n\\nbut if the virtual colonoscopy prompts more people to be\\nscreened, those\\nconcerns may be offset. colon cancer kills more americans (an\\nestimated\\n50,000 this year) than any other form of the disease, except for\\nlung\\ncancer. yet barely half of the patients who doctors say should be\\nscreened\\n- essentially, anyone 50 or older - submit to testing.\\n\\n\"we have a huge untapped, unscreened source of patients,\" said\\ndr. judy\\nyee, a radiologist at the university of california, san francisco.\\n\"we\\nhave to keep our eye on the ball, which is preventing colon cancer\\nin\\namericans.\"\\n\\nall screening methods for colon cancer, including comparatively\\nprimitive\\nstool tests, share the same premise: find and remove polyps before\\nthey\\nturn malignant.\\n\\nthere has never been a gold-standard study proving that\\ncolonoscopy extends\\nlives; that would require not testing a comparison group, which\\nsome see\\nas unethical. but \"it has been very strongly demonstrated that if\\nyou take\\nout polyps, you reduce the risk of colon cancer,\" said dr. david\\nforcione,\\na massachusetts general hospital gastroenterologist.\\n\\nfor decades, that has meant that as americans crest 50, they\\'re\\noffered two\\nthings: an aarp membership and a colonoscopy.\\n\\nbefore the colon cancer test, patients quaff a drink designed to\\nempty the\\nintestines. for many, the worst part is drinking the foul fluid,\\nand the\\ndiarrhea that follows.\\n\\nto perform the test, a doctor snakes a thin, flexible tube\\nthrough the\\ntwisting highways of the colon. a lilliputian camera is attached to\\nthe end\\nof the tube to look for evidence of cancer or polyps. anything that\\ncan\\nbecome cancerous is removed.\\n\\ngiven the contorted geography of the intestines, the tube can\\nperforate\\nthe colon. studies estimate that happens to as many as 2 of every\\n1,000\\npatients.\\n\\n\"i think that\\'s another reason people are hesitant about having\\na\\ncolonoscopy,\" syngal said.\\n\\nanother reason: the sedation given to patients to keep them\\nstill.\\n\"sedation is not trivial,\" said dr. carl jaffe, of the national\\ncancer\\ninstitute - in part because it means groggy patients need help\\ngetting\\nhome.\\n\\ngiven those drawbacks, there was considerable interest in\\ndeveloping an\\nalternative. enter the virtual colonoscopy, known in medical lingo\\nas\\ncomputed tomographic (ct) colonography.\\n\\none recent afternoon, dr. michael zalis sat in a darkened suite\\nat mass.\\ngeneral packed with dozens of flickering computer monitors. with\\nhands that\\nnavigate the computer like a piano keyboard, zalis, a radiologist,\\nreviewed\\nimages from a recent virtual colonoscopy.\\n\\nfirst, two-dimensional black-and-white snapshots of the\\npatient\\'s\\nmid-section appear. then, a computer program assembles those images\\ninto a\\nthree-dimensional \"ride\" through the flesh-hued cave of the\\nintestines,\\nas zalis looks for signs of trouble.\\n\\nnothing, nothing, nothing - until he reaches one spot where\\nthere\\'s a\\nglowing green blob.\\n\\ncould it be a polyp? by rotating the image, he determines it is\\nsimply\\nfecal matter.\\n\\nif something suspicious does appear on the scan - and\\nspecialists said that\\nhappens in about 10 to 15 percent of cases - the patient would need\\na\\nregular colonoscopy to confirm the result and, potentially, remove\\npolyps.\\nthat\\'s not such a big deal if it can all be done on the same day.\\nbut if\\nnot, the patient has to endure another bowel-cleansing episode.\\n\\n\"this may seem minor, but if you put yourself in the position\\nof the\\npatient, it\\'s not easy,\" said lynch, the houston\\ngastroenterologist.\\n\\nthat inconvenience aside, the virtual test is nearly as reliable\\nas the\\ntraditional method in detecting the polyps most likely to threaten\\nthe\\nhealth of patients, researchers reported in the new england journal\\nof\\nmedicine.\\n\\nbut the test\\'s accuracy diminished with the size of polyps.\\n\"and the\\nquestion you can argue over and over again is, are these small\\npolyps\\nsignificant? do they need to be taken out?\" forcione said. there\\nis,\\nspecialists said, no agreement on those points.\\n\\nan independent panel of scientists that reviews evidence on\\ndisease\\nprevention said last month that it remains undecided on whether\\nvirtual\\ncolonoscopy should be used routinely. specifically, the us\\npreventive\\nservices task force said it could not find evidence to erase\\nworries about\\nthe potential for unnecessary testing and radiation exposure.\\n\\nzalis dismissed the first concern; radiologists usually can\\ndistinguish\\nwhat\\'s worrisome on other organs, he said, meaning few patients\\nrequire\\nfurther review. as for radiation, specialists said exposure is less\\nof a\\nconcern for adult patients. and the radiation amount is so slight,\\nsaid\\nzalis, as to pose \"zero harm.\"\\n\\nron dow was 71 when he signed up for his first colon screening.\\nwhen\\nresearchers at mayo clinic\\'s arizona outpost asked if he would like\\none of\\nthe newfangled tests, he said sure. the scan showed something\\nsuspicious. a\\ntraditional test was done and, later, a cancerous growth

ranging in age from 16 to\\n70-something, representing a wide variety of sizes, shapes and\\nfitness levels. we come from all walks of life and gather in groups\\nof about 25 to lunge and chasse, kickbox and shimmy in an effort to\\nturn back the hands of time -- and hang on to our last threads of\\nsanity.\\n\\nthe routines are great fun and they work. fairly soon after\\nstarting class, i began to notice a difference in my fitness level.\\nbut the endorphin high isn\\'t the only thing that keeps me coming\\nback. my classmates are the most amazing group of people; they are\\nwelcoming and fun, and never fail to inspire me.\\n\\nwhen i became the stamford advocate\\'s features editor last fall\\nand asked the franchise owner, kristen hallett rzasa, to help me\\ncelebrate by doing the routine to the black-eyed peas\\' \"let\\'s get\\nit started,\" she called me on stage to dance with her and i was\\noverwhelmed by the response of the class as they cheered for my\\nmilestone. i\\'ll never know fame, but for those 3 minutes and 49\\nseconds, i was on top of the world.\\n\\nthat sense of camaraderie was very much in evidence again this\\npast summer as three of our group took the plunge to become\\ninstructors. in class, as they repeatedly practiced their audition\\nroutines, we all offered as much encouragement as we could, then\\ncheered as one by one they received their certifications.\\n\\noutside of class, many of the women are wives and mothers, some\\nalso care for elderly parents and hold down demanding jobs, but\\nstill find time to help out at their children\\'s schools, their\\nhouses of worship and in the community.\\n\\nindeed, they give freely and happily of themselves time and\\nagain, without seeking recognition for their actions.\\n\\nwomen from the group have collected soccer balls to send to lt.\\ndaniel merritt, instructor eleanor casale\\'s nephew, who is\\nstationed in iraq, so he and other soldiers can distribute them to\\nchildren there. annually, many of the women reach into their\\nclosets for clothing to donate to dress for success, and into their\\nwallets to purchase gift certificates for

book titles to share; even\\nhand-me-downs! in short, together we form a secondary family unit.\\n\\nthanks to time logged on the dance floor, i\\'ve learned that\\nsometimes, the simplest acts affect us most.\\n\\nand these days, as airbrushed beauties seem to beckon from every\\nmagazine cover, billboard and tv screen, i\\'m not keen to imitate\\ntheir looks. indeed, as i pack up my sneakers and

with yeast, a load of\\npulverized\\nswitch grass or paper sludge, and a few days of fermentation.\\n\\nanything goes here, as scientists try to find a quicker, cheaper\\nway to\\nmake cellulosic ethanol, a \"second generation\" biofuel that uses\\nnon-food\\nplant residue and other waste as its main ingredients, instead of\\ncorn or\\nsoy.\\n\\nthe key is splicing together the right combination of genes,\\nsuch as those\\nfound in termites or an elephant stomach, to create a super bug\\ncapable of\\nproducing cellulose-digesting and sugar-fermenting enzymes that\\nwill help\\nto streamline the brewing process from four steps to one.\\n\\n\"don\\'t ask, \\'how did you get something that used to be in an\\nelephant\\nstomach?\"\\' joked bruce jamerson, mascoma\\'s chief executive and a\\nmember of\\nmassachusetts\\' advanced biofuels task force, which was created by\\nthe state\\nlast november.\\n\\njamerson\\'s company, which has corporate offices in boston,\\nrecently\\npartnered with general motors corp. to help further its scientists\\'\\nwork at\\nthe research facility in lebanon, which has 66 employees.\\n\\n\"i\\'d like to be ((test)) driving some vehicles by the end of\\nthis year\\nwith our product,\" jamerson said.\\n\\nif successful, mascoma\\'s biofuel could be a locally produced\\nsubstitute for\\ngasoline made out of petroleum, as well as for gas alternatives\\nmade from\\nfood crops. such \"first generation\" biofuels have come under fire\\nbecause\\ncrops that once fed people were being used to make fuel, possibly\\ndriving\\nup food costs, and producing more greenhouse gases than first\\nthought.\\n\\nenvironmentalists say mascoma\\'s biofuel looks promising because\\nit has the\\npotential to be both affordable and sustainable.\\n\\n\"one of the big things ((they\\'re doing)) is making it possible\\nto use a\\nlot of different materials like grasses or wood chips,\" said\\njeremy\\nmartin, a senior scientist with the union of concerned scientists,\\na\\nnonprofit group in cambridge.\\n\\nand it appears mascoma is asking questions that martin said\\nearly biofuel\\nmakers often did not ponder, such as, \"where do those\\n((materials)) come\\nfrom and what\\'s the impact of getting them?\"\\n\\nbut commercial production of an environmentally friendly,\\ncost-competitive\\nbiofuel like the one mascoma is developing is still years away,\\naccording\\nto the state task force. it estimates that by 2025, the biofuels\\nindustry\\ncould add up to $1 billion a year to the massachusetts economy and\\ncreate\\nup to 4,000 jobs. challenges include getting production and\\nfuel-distribution facilities running and making vehicles powered by\\nbiofuels more available.\\n\\nfor now, mascoma researchers in lebanon are still trying to hit\\nupon the\\nright ingredients for their biofuel recipe, which is likely to\\ninclude a\\nstrain of the microbe thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum, or t.\\nsacch.\\n\\njamerson said his company\\'s ethanol-making process takes less\\ntime than the\\ntraditional four-step process, which calls for the addition of\\ncostly\\nenzymes that range in price from 50 cents to $1 or more for every\\ngallon of\\nfuel produced.\\n\\non a recent afternoon, bottles filled with samples of microbes\\nlined the\\nshelves in the \"organism discovery\" room of the mascoma lab. it\\'s\\nhere\\nthat microbes, some of which were found in hot springs at\\nyellowstone\\nnational park, are tested in an oxygen-free chamber to see what\\nthey do.\\n\\n\"just because they grow in a hot spring doesn\\'t mean they\\'re\\ngoing to grow\\nin a plant,\" said larry feinberg, a research scientist.\\n\\nin the \"molecular biology\" room, which is permeated with the\\nodor of\\nyeast, scientists splice together genes to develop microbes with\\nspecific\\nproperties, trying to find the right combination. the cultures -\\nwhich look\\nlike little dots of cake frosting - are grown in petri dishes.\\nlater, they\\nare transferred to shaking flasks.\\n\\n\"they like the agitation,\" explained lab manager nathan\\nmargolis.\\n\\nin the pretreament room, materials such as switch grass, corn\\nstover, wood\\nchips, and paper sludge get heated and turned into a substance the\\ncolor of\\ncoffee grounds that resembles ripped-up peat moss.\\n\\neventually, everything gets tossed together in a fermentation\\ntank that\\nlooks like an oversize french press accessorized with random tubes.\\n\\n\"this is where the action is,\" margolis said of the dark\\nbeer-like\\nsubstance brewing in the tanks. \"at the end of the day we\\'re going\\nto send\\nit over to analysis and find out, you know, how much

they raised their sons edward and\\ndavid.\\n\\nat 42, edward taft jr. was driving home from worcester in 1967\\nwhen he died\\nin a car accident on the massachusetts turnpike. when the aquarium\\nofficially opened two years later, his widow and two sons cut the\\nceremonial ribbon of seaweed.\\n\\nin 1973, the mckeys married and for the next quarter century\\nwere among the\\ntop amateur dancers, on ice and on the floor.\\n\\nthey were new england senior champions in ice dancing three\\ntimes, and\\ntheir training led them from the rink to the dance floor. their\\ncoach was\\ncecilia colledge, an olympic silver medalist who had moved from her\\nhome in\\nengland to boston.\\n\\n\"she thought it would amplify our presentation on the ice if we\\nlearned\\nthe international style of ballroom dancing,\" john mckey said.\\n\"so off we\\nwent and took lessons.\"\\n\\nthen a back injury prevented him from skating with enough\\nprecision for\\ncompetitions, and the mckeys turned their attention to the\\nballroom. the\\nmale partner is the leader, but john mckey said he often felt as if\\nshe\\nguided them around the dance floor through the purity of her\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\n\"the letters i have been reading about her all speak of her\\nlovely smile\\nand the delicious laugh she had and the joy she had in what she was\\ndoing,\\nespecially when she was dancing,\" he said. \"she just entered into\\nher own\\nworld at that point and brought me along with her. she was a\\nwonderful\\npartner. she knew what i wanted to do even before i had thought\\nwhat was\\nnext.\"\\n\\nhe added that \"another expression that comes up in the letters\\nis that she\\nwas such a lady. she was so poised on the ballroom floor. in a\\ncompetition,\\ni never saw her get rattled, and people loved watching her. she had\\nmany\\nfans.\"\\n\\namong the fans were the judges of amateur ballroom dancing\\ncompetitions.\\nthe mckeys won the us senior championship four times and the north\\namerican\\nchampionship once.\\n\\npracticing was never a chore. they danced for two hours each\\nmorning, \"and\\nfrequently, we\\'d be out dancing for two

that\\nthey would\\nhave murdered us if we hadn\\'t behaved.\"\\n\\nthey competed until the mid-1990s, then continued to give the\\noccasional\\ndance demonstrations. the mckeys shared other passions, too. they\\npainted\\ntogether, studied french, and traveled to france.\\n\\n\"i miss her so and wish she was here, but we had such a full,\\nbeautiful,\\nbeautiful life together,\" he said. \"we were

money\\nmen,\" 2006) to andrew jackson (\"his life and times,\" 2005) to\\nbenjamin franklin (\"the first american,\" 2000) and even teddy\\nroosevelt (\"tr: the last romantic,\" 1996), has just published\\nwhat pulitzer prize-winning historian david oshinsky says \"will\\nquickly emerge as the finest one-volume biography of fdr.\"\\n\\n\"traitor to his class\" is a remarkably vivid and readable\\nportrait of a man who was an enigma to many. here was a man born to\\nfamily wealth and influence, whose doting parents (especially his\\nmother, sara), good looks and charm \"made life easy.\"\\n\\nbrands writes of the youthful fdr, \"he waltzed from triumph to\\ntriumph, scarcely breaking a sweat.\"\\n\\nwhy, wondered those of his privileged class, did he consort with\\nand champion the causes of the masses? the question was not just\\nwhy was roosevelt a democrat -- his cousin, teddy, the president,\\nwas a good republican -- but why was he involved in the sordid world\\nof politics in the first place?\\n\\nwhen fdr was pursuing his first term as president in 1932,\\nwalter lippman, the great political commentator, challenged anyone\\nto \"point to a single act of his which involved any political\\nrisk.\"\\n\\nhe continued his assessment: \"franklin d. roosevelt is no\\ncrusader. he is no tribune of the people. he is no enemy of\\nentrenched privilege. he is a pleasant man who, without any\\nimportant qualifications for the office, would very much like to be\\npresident.\"\\n\\nhow wrong the founder of the new republic turned out to be --\\nexcept the part about fdr wanting to be president.\\n\\nnearly a century after fdr\\'s political rise, he remains a\\nhistorical figure carved in our collective memory; he\\'s the man\\nnoted for his \"fear itself\" and \"day of infamy\" speeches.\\n\\nwhat brands has done, through exhaustive research and a natural\\nstoryteller\\'s flair, is bring to life, to humanize, a man and his\\ncircle, including \"the franklin and eleanor team,\" who, like\\nlincoln, led the country at one of its most critical crossroads.\\n\\nbrands recently answered a few questions for the express-news.\\n\\nq. the title is intriguing. why was fdr \"a traitor to his\\nclass\"?\\n\\na. the wealthy felt roosevelt was selling them out to the\\nmasses, preaching cheap populism when he should have been\\nprotecting their (and his) birthright.\\n\\nmost of them were believers in trickle-down economics -- the\\nwell-being of the rich and powerful would find its way down to the\\nordinary folks. roosevelt thought this was backward -- the welfare\\nof the ordinary folks would bubble up to the rich.\\n\\nq. when you set out to write a biography of fdr, what did you\\nplan to achieve? there are hundreds, if not thousands of books on\\nfdr; what about the man hasn\\'t been illuminated?\\n\\na. i wanted to answer the implicit question of the subtitle: how\\ndid a son of privilege become the sponsor of policies that\\nradically reshaped the landscape of american politics?\\n\\nq. what do we owe fdr? how would this country be different if he\\nhadn\\'t come along at such a crucial moment in our history? and i\\'m\\nthinking first, the great depression and the new deal, and second,\\nworld war ii?\\n\\na. roosevelt radically reoriented american thinking both\\ndomestically and in foreign affairs. at home he made americans\\nbelieve that government should help the less fortunate and those\\nwho, through no fault of their own, found themselves in tough\\nstraits. americans still believe this, even if we quibble about the\\nnature of this help. in foreign affairs roosevelt attacked the\\nisolationist thinking of the 1930s, convincing americans that their\\nown safety required permanent attention to the affairs of the\\nworld. as with domestic affairs, this conclusion is one americans\\nhave never seriously reconsidered, even 60 years later.\\n\\nq. you must have done a mountain of research for the book. was\\nthere something that completely surprised you or was totally out of\\ncharacter with the image you held of the man?\\n\\na. many public figures are most truly themselves when they act,\\nspeak and write in private. this is why historians spend so much\\ntime looking at old letters and diaries. roosevelt was most himself\\nin public. roosevelt\\'s press conferences and fireside chats were\\nconsistently brilliant pieces of political theater -- which didn\\'t\\nmake them less sincere . . .merely more effective. to listen to his\\nfireside chats, which are available on the internet, and to read\\nthe transcripts of his press conferences is to be transported to a\\ntime when the occupant of the oval office was the most riveting\\npersonality in the country.\\n\\nq. if fdr was alive today, what advice do you think he would\\nhave for both presidential candidates?\\n\\na. he would tell the president-elect to remember who hired him:\\nthe people of the united states. forget the lobbyists, forget the\\nbig donors -- put the people first, and all will come right.\\n\\ntraitor to his class: the privileged life and radical presidency\\nof franklin delano

property insurer  dramatically escalated this year, with almost a half-million homeowners moved to private insurers. but the private firms are not the state farms or allstates of the insurance world. they are mostly small companies, created in the last three or four years, that upon state approval can take policies out of citizens by notifying the homeowner with a letter. homeowners who do not \"opt out\" of the transfer are automatically moved to the private firm. about 160,000 homeowner policies will leave citizens in november and december. many are in the tampa bay area. of the 14

longest-running musical on broadway.\\n\\neven if you\\'ve seen the phantom 50 times, it\\'s easy to be wowed\\nby the eerie travels across a fog-shrouded lake, the elaborate\\ncostumes and the breathtaking escapes of the man in the half-mask.\\n\\nhow does it all happen? tampabay.com took a tour backstage as\\nthe north american touring production was setting up for a run in\\ntampa, fla. here are a few interesting factoids we learned during\\nour expedition through the opera populaire:\\n\\ngreat big convoy: most touring stage productions need three to\\nseven trucks to transport sets and costumes from city to city.\\nwicked, another popular and elaborate production, requires 14\\ntrucks. phantom\\'s 230 costumes, 1.5 ton staircase, 28 hanging\\nbackdrops , stage facade and opera boxes require 20 trucks. yes,\\nthat means it\\'s three times as large as most productions.\\n\\noh, the humanity: how many people does it take to stage one\\nshow? about 130 cast and crew members and musicians from 40 states.\\nabout 35 are actors. between 55 and 60 locals are hired in each\\ncity as dressers and technicians, but no local actors are hired to\\nappear in the touring production.\\n\\nprep time: it takes 10 days to set up the phantom production in\\neach city, during which the venue cannot accommodate any other\\nshows. when the final show is over, it takes only 12 hours to pack\\nit up.\\n\\nwigged out: because it\\'s a period piece set 100 years ago,\\nphantom makes use of 200 wigs, most of them made from human hair.\\nthey\\'re washed as needed and then placed in a \"wig oven,\" in\\nwhich a soft, low heat gently dries them. a staff of five\\nhairdressers sets the wigs before each performance.\\n\\nscary moment: with such a large-scale production, there are\\nseveral hold-your-breath and cross-your-finger moments for the\\ncrew. here\\'s one: at the beginning of the show, when the dust\\ncovers are yanked from the stage facade as the music begins, the\\nsheets have on occasion fallen onto the poor musicians in the\\norchestra pit or gotten snagged in the rigging for the chandelier.\\nin either case, the production then pauses while it\\'s sorted out.\\nthat pesky phantom is not to blame, we\\'re assured.\\n\\ncruise control: the most elaborately staged scenes of the show\\nare the two boat journeys with the phantom and christine. the boat,\\nwhich seems to glide effortlessly over the underground lake below\\nthe opera house, is not on a track. rather it\\'s guided by infrared\\nbeams of light and a stage technician with a joystick just inside\\nthe wings of the stage. the drive mechanism and battery are hidden\\nbelow the pillows of the boat  actually only \"half\" a boat\\nbecause the audience can see only the front of it.\\n\\nstill a mystery: while much of the set was open for us to\\ninspect, a few production icons remain strictly off limits, and\\nphotographs are forbidden of many set pieces, which remain\\ntrademarked. yes, that means no trying on the phantom\\'s mask, which\\nremains locked away when not in use. and the method behind the\\nphantom\\'s breathtaking escapes  during the masquerade number and in\\nthe finale  are closely guarded secrets. \"i can\\'t say,\" advance\\nstage manager david hansen swears. \"i gotta keep my job.\"\\n\\non the web\\n\\nfor more

less than a\\nminute left. the fourth was decided by six points and was,\\nnaturally, an upset.\\n\\nand very little seemed to clear up in the race for the acc\\'s\\ndivision titles.\\n\\nwith four weeks left in the regular season, 11 of the league\\'s\\n12 teams are mathematically alive.\\n\\nit\\'s not quite anybody\\'s ball game, but it\\'s pretty close.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve felt all along that we\\'ve just got to take care of our\\nbusiness and let it work out,\" georgia tech coach paul johnson\\nsaid. \"if we can finish with only two losses in the acc, i feel\\ngood about our chances.\"\\n\\nhere\\'s a look at the eight teams with the best shot at earning a\\ntrip to tampa for the acc title game, with reasons why and why not\\neach team can make it there.\\n\\natlantic division\\n\\nmaryland (6-2, 3-1)\\n\\n-- games remaining: at virginia tech, north carolina, florida\\nstate, at boston college.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: the terrapins are the only atlantic team\\nthat controls its fate and can even afford to drop one game (so\\nlong as it\\'s not against florida state).\\n\\nmaryland plays its best against tough competition. it has won\\nits last five games against ranked teams.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: while the running game has returned to form,\\nrunning back da\\'rel scott (acc-best 102.6 rushing yards per game)\\nmay not play thursday against virginia tech with a shoulder injury.\\n\\nmaryland might be the most unpredictable team in the league. the\\nterps beat cal the week after losing to middle tennessee state and\\nshut out wake forest after being shut out by virginia. not exactly\\nthe consistency you\\'d want for a team trying to run the table.\\n\\nflorida state (6-2, 3-2)\\n\\n-- games remaining: clemson, boston college, at maryland,\\nflorida.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: saturday\\'s loss aside, the seminoles are\\nranked first in total offense and defense in the league and have\\nwon four of their last five.\\n\\nin a season where so many games have come down to the last\\nminute, having the conference\\'s best kicker (graham gano, who has\\nmade 15 field goals in a row) is an asset.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: florida state coaches will have to be wary\\nthat the heart-wrenching loss to georgia tech does not have a\\ncarryover effect.\\n\\nthe seminoles\\' young offensive line has had trouble the past two\\nweeks against tough defensive lines. they\\'ll face two more against\\nclemson and boston college.\\n\\nwake forest (5-3, 3-2)\\n\\n-- games remaining: virginia, at n.c. state, boston college,\\nvanderbilt.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: while he\\'s had an up-and-down season,\\nquarterback riley skinner has been down this road before, having\\nled wake forest to the acc title in 2006.\\n\\nkicker shane popham, subbing for injured all-acc kicker sam\\nswank, was 3-for-3 against duke, suggesting his inconsistent play\\nof the previous three games may be in the past.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: prior to beating duke 33-30 in overtime\\nsaturday, the demon deacons had not scored more than 17 points\\nsince the second game of the season. given that all of wake\\'s\\nscoring drives in regulation began inside duke territory, this\\nwould seem more like an aberration than a new trend.\\n\\nwake forest has not delivered a dominating performance against\\nanyone since its season opener. it isn\\'t easy to imagine the\\ndeacons turning it on down the homestretch.\\n\\ncoastal division\\n\\ngeorgia tech (7-2, 4-2)\\n\\n-- games remaining: at north carolina, miami, at georgia.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: tech\\'s 288 rushing yards against florida\\nstate suggest that its option-based attack, spearheaded by\\nquarterback josh nesbitt, may be finding its form.\\n\\nmost teams would likely take a 6-2 record and take their\\nchances. at 4-2, tech is closer to that finish line than anyone\\nelse.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: the jackets, after allowing an average of\\n11.6 points per game in their first seven games, have now given up\\n26.0 in the last two. tech needs its secondary to get well soon.\\n\\npaul johnson acknowledged that the team, even players who were\\nin the lineup, is banged up. that won\\'t help against a rested north\\ncarolina team saturday.\\n\\nmiami (6-3, 3-2)\\n\\n-- games remaining: virginia tech, at georgia tech, n.c. state.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: with four wins in a row, including an\\novertime victory over virginia in charlottesville, the hurricanes\\nare the hottest team in the acc. they have this week off before\\nplaying virginia tech at home in two thursdays.\\n\\nby starting 2-3, miami has stayed below the radar. that will\\nlikely help a team loaded with underclassmen perhaps not ready to\\nhandle the burden of expectations.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: the flip side of being hot is that no team\\nhas won more than three league games in a row. the hurricanes may\\nbe ripe for a stumble.\\n\\nquarterbacks robert marve and jacory harris have led the\\nhurricanes this far, but have not provided consistent play.\\n\\nvirginia (5-4, 3-2)\\n\\n-- games remaining: at wake forest, clemson, at virginia tech.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: if the cavaliers run the table, they\\'ll\\nown tiebreakers over north carolina, georgia tech and virginia\\ntech, which is a nice ace in the hole.\\n\\ndespite a costly fumble against miami, running back cedric\\npeerman has been one of the league\\'s best running backs and will\\nplay two teams - wake and clemson - that are vulnerable against the\\nrun.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: the cavaliers finish with two of three games\\non the road. in the last four years, virginia is 7-13 in road\\ngames.\\n\\nvirginia has given up an average of 173.0 rushing yards in its\\npast three games. that doesn\\'t bode well.\\n\\nnorth carolina (6-2, 2-2)\\n\\n-- games remaining: georgia tech, at maryland, n.c. state, duke.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: georgia tech coach paul johnson said the\\ntar heels might be the best team in the conference. so they\\'ve got\\nthat going for them.\\n\\nquarterback t.j. yates, the heels\\' starter earlier this season,\\nmay be able to return from a sprained ankle for carolina\\'s final\\nfour games.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: especially this year, four games left on the\\nschedule means four games left to trip up.\\n\\nkickers casey barth and jay wooten are a pedestrian 11-of-16 on\\nfield goals. it cost them in a three-point loss to virginia tech,\\nand may bite them again.\\n\\nvirginia tech (5-3, 2-2)\\n\\n-- games remaining: maryland, at miami, duke, virginia.\\n\\n-- why they\\'ll make it: with wins over georgia tech and north\\ncarolina and remaining games against miami and virginia, the hokies\\nare the only coastal team that controls its fate.\\n\\nfurther, three of its final four games are at home, including\\nthe finale against virginia.\\n\\n-- why they won\\'t: virginia tech may be without quarterbacks\\ntyrod taylor and sean glennon thursday against maryland. both\\nsprained their ankles in the oct. 25 loss to florida state.\\n\\nregardless, the hokies\\' problems on offense go beyond\\nquarterback. the offense is ranked 112th in division i-a.\\n\\nken sugiura writes for the atlanta journal-constitution. e-mail:\\nksugiura at ajc.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nmy husband, richard, smoked cigarettes for 50 years, having\\nfailed several attempts to quit on his own. when a friend told him\\nin august 1994 that hypnosis had enabled her to quit, he decided to\\ngive it a try.\\n\\n\"it didn\\'t work; i wasn\\'t hypnotized,\" he declared after his\\none and only session. but it did work; since that day, he has not\\ntaken one puff of a cigarette.\\n\\ngloria kanter of boynton beach, fla., thought her attempt in\\n1985 to use hypnosis to overcome her fear of flying had failed.\\n\"when the therapist brought me out, i said it didn\\'t work,\" she\\nrecalled in an interview. \"i told her, \\'i heard everything you\\nsaid.\"\\'\\n\\nnonetheless, the next time she and her husband headed for the\\nairport, she was not drenched in sweat and paralyzed with fear. \"i\\nwas just fine,\" she said, \"and i\\'ve been fine ever since.\"\\n\\nlike many others whose knowledge of hypnotism comes from movies\\nand stage shows, my husband and kanter misunderstood what hypnosis\\nis all about. while in a hypnotic trance, you are neither\\nunconscious nor asleep, but rather in a deeply relaxed state that\\nrenders the mind highly focused and ready to accept suggestions to\\nhelp you accomplish your goals.\\n\\nhypnosis has been mired in controversy for two centuries, and\\nits benefits are often overstated. it does not help everyone who\\nwants to quit smoking, for example; then again, neither do other\\nkinds of treatments.\\n\\nand the patient\\'s attitude is critical. in the words of brian\\nalman, a psychologist who practices hypnosis in san diego, \"the\\npower of hypnosis actually resides in the patient and not in the\\ndoctor.\"\\n\\nroberta temes, a clinical hypnotist in scotch plains, n.j.,\\ninsists that hypnosis cannot make people do anything they don\\'t\\nwant to do. hypnosis can succeed only in helping people make\\nchanges they desire, she said in an interview.\\n\\nin her book \"the complete idiot\\'s guide to hypnosis,\" temes\\npoints out that success in achieving your goal is the best proof\\nthat you were really hypnotized. she also suggests a second or\\nthird session if you didn\\'t quite reach your goal after the first\\ntry.\\n\\nin effect, hypnosis is the epitome of mind-body medicine. it can\\nenable the mind to tell the body how to react, and modify the\\nmessages that the body sends to the mind. it has been used to\\ncounter the nausea of pregnancy and chemotherapy; dental and\\ntest-taking anxiety; pain associated with surgery, root canal\\ntreatment and childbirth; fear of flying and public speaking;\\ncompulsive hair-pulling; and intractable hiccups, among many other\\ntroublesome health problems.\\n\\nwriting in the permanente journal in 2001, alman said that\\n\"useful potential\" for benefiting from hypnosis \"exists within\\neach patient.\" \"the goal of modern medical hypnosis,\" he said,\\n\"is to help patients use this unconscious potential.\"\\n\\nalman described a 65-year-old concentration camp survivor who\\nrepeatedly choked when she tried to swallow, though examinations of\\nher esophagus revealed no obstruction. after three hypnotherapy\\nsessions, her problem was solved. \"i was liberated from my\\nesophagus,\" the patient said.\\n\\nyou may not even have to be face to face with a hypnotist to\\nbenefit medically. temes said hypnosis could be helpful even if\\ndone with a cassette tape or cd, or by telephone, which she offers\\nas part of her practice. she said many helpful cds could be found\\nthrough the web site www.hypnosisnetwork.com.\\n\\nellen fineman, a physical therapist in portland, ore., had had\\nfive surgeries to repair a retina that kept detaching. hoping that\\na sixth attempt would hold, she used a hypnosis tape prepared by\\ntemes for patients undergoing surgery.\\n\\nthe tape \"was very calming and reassuring,\" fineman said in an\\ninterview.\\n\\n\"it told me that i would be in the hands of professionals who\\nwould take good care of me and that i\\'d have minimal swelling,\"\\nshe said. \"this time the surgery went superbly -- no inflammation,\\nno swelling and no more detachment. the surgeon was amazed and\\nasked what i had done differently this time.\"\\n\\nas with any other profession, some hypnotherapists are more\\ntalented than others. temes suggests that word of mouth may be the\\nbest way to find someone practiced in hypnosis for the kind of\\nproblem you\\'re trying to solve. also helpful is the american\\nsociety of clinical hypnosis, at www.asch.net, which maintains a\\nreferral list of therapists, both certified and not, by location\\nand specialty.\\n\\nwhile not everyone is easily hypnotized, nearly everyone can\\nslip into a therapeutic trance, temes maintains. another of her\\npatients, dr. susan clarvit, a new york psychiatrist, thought she\\ncould not be hypnotized -- she was too scientific, too rational a\\nperson, she said.\\n\\n\"but i was desperate,\" clarvit said in an interview. \"i was\\npregnant with my second child and too nauseated to be alive. dr.\\ntemes asked me what i held most often, and i said a pen. she\\nhypnotized me so that when i held a pen i had an overall feeling of\\nwellness. i held a pen all the time, even while driving, and didn\\'t\\nfeel nauseated.\"\\n\\nunder hypnosis, clarvit was given a posthypnotic suggestion that\\nlinked holding a pen to feeling well. such suggestions enable\\npeople to practice a new, desired behavior after being brought out\\nof the trance.\\n\\nsomeone trying to overcome snacking on sweets might be told,\\n\"when you are hungry, you will eat vegetables.\" the suggestion to\\na smoker might be \"you will drink water when you want a\\ncigarette,\" and someone terrified of public speaking might be told\\n\"you will do deep breathing when you feel scared.\"\\n\\nmany patients are also taught to practice self-hypnosis to\\nreinforce the new behavior. dr. karen n. olness, a professor of\\npediatrics at case western reserve university who is the president\\nof the international society of hypnosis, said that \"self-hypnosis\\ntraining in children is an effective and practical strategy to\\nprevent migraine episodes.\"\\n\\nsometimes patients with well-established illnesses can benefit\\nindirectly from hypnosis.\\n\\nalman told of a woman with multiple sclerosis who was treated\\nwith hypnosis for depression that had failed to improve with\\nantidepressants. almost immediately, he reported, not only did the\\nwoman\\'s depression ease, but her gait and speech improved markedly.\\n\\nhe explained that for many patients the medical problem is so\\ncomplex that specific directions and commands may be ineffective.\\nthe benefit from hypnosis may rely more on unleashing unconscious\\nprocesses within the patient. he suggested that there exists \"a\\nwealth of material in the patient\\'s unconscious that can be used in\\nhealing\" but lamented the fact that although medical hypnosis can\\noften produce rapid change even in difficult cases, it is\\n\"underutilized as a therapeutic tool.\"\\n\\nq: when scum is skimmed off homemade soup, what nutrients are\\nlost?\\n\\na: soup scum consists primarily of coagulated protein combined\\nwith fat, said christina stark, a nutritionist at cornell\\nuniversity.\\n\\n\"as you begin making soup, heat causes a small proportion of\\nthe dissolved meat or vegetable proteins to coagulate, or clump up,\\nin new ways,\" she said. \"as the soup continues to heat, oils in\\nthe water also go to the surface and combine with the proteins,\\ncreating the foam or froth you see.\"\\n\\n\"we get plenty of those nutrients in our diets,\" she said,\\n\"so skimming the scum away won\\'t lead to any significant nutrient\\nlosses.\" she pointed out that if taking off the scum entices you\\nto eat a larger serving of clearer and more appetizing vegetable\\nsoup, \"then you could end up consuming more nutrients than if you\\nleft the scum.\"\\n\\na more important nutrient loss can occur in the vegetables\\nbefore and during preparation, stark said. vitamins and minerals\\nvary in their sensitivity to environmental factors. vitamin c is\\nwater-soluble and is sensitive to oxygen, light and heat, but\\nstable in acid conditions. folic acid, another water-soluble\\nvitamin, is unstable in acid and light, but stable when exposed to\\noxygen or heat. minerals and fiber are generally stable in all\\nthese conditions.\\n\\n\"so for example, if the broccoli was shipped across country and\\nthen sat for days on the store shelf or at home before being used,\\nthere may be significant losses of vitamin c before it ever gets\\ninto the soup,\" she said.\\n\\nbut the good news with soup is that \"you generally consume any\\nwater-soluble vitamins that have leached into the broth,\" stark\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe claim\\n      soy can lower cholesterol.\\n\\n      the facts\\n\\nsoy foods have been credited with all sorts of health benefits,\\nbut perhaps none so appealing as this assertion.\\n\\nthe notion was cemented in 1999, when the food and drug\\nadministration allowed companies to claim that 25 grams of soy\\nprotein a day, in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol,\\n\"may reduce the risk of heart disease.\" the agency evaluated\\nstudies -- including an industry-financed analysis published in the\\nnew england journal of medicine in 1995 -- concluding that soy\\nprotein could cut cholesterol.\\n\\nbut studies since have raised doubts. in 2006, an american heart\\nassociation advisory panel reviewed a decade of studies and\\ndetermined that soy products had no significant effects on hdl\\n(\"good\" cholesterol) or triglycerides, and little or no ability\\nto lower \"bad\" cholesterol, or ldl. another study, published in\\naugust in the american journal of clinical nutrition, found that\\nconsuming 24 grams of soy protein daily had no \"significant effect\\non plasma ldl\" in people with mildly elevated cholesterol.\\n\\nbut the issue is far from clear-cut. another line of research\\nshows that soy seems to help when combined with foods low in fat\\nand high in fiber and the compounds called plant sterols -- in other\\nwords, an overall healthy diet.\\n\\nthe bottom line\\n\\nthere is evidence that soy can improve cholesterol, but the jury\\nis still out.\\n\\ndamp weather and gusty winds from the northeast will prevail\\nfrom the carolinas to the middle atlantic coast as slow-moving low\\npressure strengthens off the southeast coast on tuesday. the\\nheaviest and steadiest rain is expected over southeastern virginia\\nand eastern north carolina. the rain will spread north into\\npennsylvania and new jersey on tuesday night.\\n\\nunseasonably mild, dry weather will cover a large area from the\\nwestern slopes of the appalachians to the western plains. afternoon\\ntemperatures will average 10 to 20 degrees above normal.\\n\\ncool, unsettled conditions will sweep into the west in the wake\\nof a strong pacific cold front. scattered valley showers and\\nmountain snow will be common from the pacific northwest to the\\nwestern slopes of the northern rockies.\\n\\nfocus: election weather\\n\\nthe weather on election day is usually reported with extra\\nemphasis because of a long-standing conviction among political\\npundits that atmospheric conditions will affect voter turnout. a\\nstudy published in 2005 by researchers from the university of south\\ncarolina suggests there is a statistically significant\\nrelationship. using county data from presidential elections between\\n1948 and 2000, the research finds that rainfall reduces voter\\nparticipation at a rate of about 1 percent per inch. two inches of\\nsnow also decreases voter turnout by about 1 percent. today,\\nlocally heavy rain will occur near the southeast coast while patchy\\nrain and mountain snow will fall over the interior west, but much\\nof the nation will be dry.\\n\\nfungus may be cause of die-offs in bats, researchers say\\n\\nsomething is killing the little brown bats of the northeast, and\\nresearchers may have fingered the culprit: a fungus.\\n\\ndavid s. blehert of the u.s. geological survey\\'s national\\nwildlife health center in wisconsin and colleagues identified a\\nfungus linked to white-nose syndrome, a condition that has affected\\nbats in recent winters in upstate new york, massachusetts and\\nvermont. the fungus, newly described, is unusual in that it grows\\nin the cold, dotting areas of the bat\\'s skin with white strands. it\\npenetrates the skin through hair follicles and sweat glands and may\\ncause the bats to starve as they hibernate, the researchers said.\\n\\n\"we do have good circumstantial evidence that this could be the\\nprimary pathogen\" causing the deaths of large percentages of\\npopulations of little browns and other bats in caves in the region,\\nblehert said. the die-offs are one of the worst calamities to hit\\nbat populations in the united states.\\n\\nit had been thought that the fungus was a secondary symptom of\\nwhatever was killing the animals -- a virus or a toxin like an\\nenvironmental contaminant. but the fact that the identical organism\\nwas found in bats from several caves \"kind of rules out the\\npossibility that there are all kinds of fungi out there and that\\nopportunistically they are infecting the animals,\" said alan c.\\nhicks of the new york state department of environmental\\nconservation, a co-author of a paper on the fungus published online\\nby science.\\n\\nblehert said the infection could have led to starvation because\\nof the way bats hibernate -- they cycle through two-week stages of\\ndeep torpor interrupted by brief wakeful periods. the fungal\\ninfection may make the bats wake up more often, and since each\\nperiod of wakefulness uses up vast stores of fat, the bats may\\ndeplete their energy reserves much sooner than normal.\\n\\nmore research is needed to determine how to combat the die-offs,\\nbut one thing is clear, blehert said: just spraying a cave with\\nfungicide could do more harm than good.\\n\\n\"wiping out all the fungal organisms in a cave probably would\\nbe a bad idea,\" he said.\\n\\nbacteria on the move, eating their fill\\n\\nbacteria move in mysterious ways. myxococcus xanthus, for\\nexample, a harmless soil microbe, forms rippling swarms by the\\nmillions as it devours other microbes as prey.\\n\\nthis organized back-and-forth behavior \"was thought to occur\\nparticularly in response to starvation,\" said john r. kirby, a\\nmicrobiologist at the university of iowa. but kirby, james e.\\nberleman and others at iowa report in the proceedings of the\\nnational academy of sciences that m. xanthus acts this way in\\nresponse to food, and uses chemical sensing and signaling pathways\\nto do so.\\n\\ndirected bacterial movement that is controlled in this way is\\nknown as chemotaxis, and has been observed in individual microbes\\nas well as in colonies that organize into biofilms or other\\nstructures. because m. xanthus uses chemotaxis-like pathways to\\nmove over its prey, the researchers call this behavior predataxis.\\n(a video is at nytimes.com/science.)\\n\\nthe swarming changed over time. when a lot of e. coli was\\navailable, the bacteria moved back and forth tightly; kirby likened\\nit to a vacuum cleaner moving repeatedly over a dirty spot. as the\\nprey was consumed, the pattern lengthened and dissipated.\\npresumably the bacteria needed to release a lot of digestive\\nenzymes at first, but less and less as time went on, he said.\\n\\nfurther study of this kind of coordinated behavior may help in\\nunderstanding certain diseases that involve motile bacteria, kirby\\nsaid, and in developing methods to clean up environmental\\ncontaminants using microbes.\\n\\ncommercial production of chickens takes toll on genetic\\ndiversity\\n\\nto the connoisseur of fine food, chicken may seem depressingly\\nmonotonous no matter how it\\'s prepared. but scientists worry about\\na more basic degree of sameness -- a lack of genetic diversity in\\nthe birds that are raised for meat and eggs.\\n\\nan analysis of commercial chicken populations around the world\\nby william m. muir of purdue university and colleagues has revealed\\nthe extent of the problem. fifty percent or more of the diversity\\nof ancestral breeds has been lost, they report in the proceedings\\nof the national academy of sciences. that could make chicken\\nproduction more susceptible to disease outbreaks for which\\nresistant genes have disappeared.\\n\\nsampling about 2,500 birds, the researchers looked at several\\nthousand instances of genetic variation and used that to estimate\\nwhat a hypothetical ancestral population looked like genetically.\\n\"then we were able to say what is missing\" in commercial birds,\\nmuir said.\\n\\ntheir findings indicate that most of the diversity was lost with\\nthe advent of wide-scale commercial production in the 1950s. only a\\nhandful of hundreds of breeds have been crossed to produce broilers\\nand layers.\\n\\nmuir said restoring some diversity was not simple a matter of\\ncrossing with more breeds -- producers would lose the improvements\\nthey have made in existing lines. instead, one approach would be to\\nuse genetic markers to aid in cross-breeding, \"to select for the\\nparts that are good,\" he said.\\n\\nstudy links depression to premature deliveries\\n\\npregnant women with symptoms of depression are at increased risk\\nfor premature delivery, a new study has found.\\n\\nthe report, published online oct. 23 in human reproduction, used\\na 20-question depression scale to interview 791 women early in\\ntheir pregnancies. scores on the questionnaire range from 0 to 60,\\nwith higher scores indicating more, and more frequent, depressive\\nsymptoms.\\n\\nafter controlling for previous preterm births and miscarriages,\\nsocioeconomic status, education and other variables, the scientists\\nfound that compared with those who scored below 16, those with a\\nscore of 16 to 21 had a 60 percent increased risk of delivering\\nprematurely. women who scored 22 or higher had more than twice the\\nrisk.\\n\\n\"depression during pregnancy is frequently dismissed or\\nunderdiagnosed,\" said dr. de-kun li, the lead author. \"i hope our\\nstudy will raise a red flag.\"\\n\\nli, an epidemiologist at kaiser permanente\\'s research division\\nin oakland, calif., said that the safety of antidepressant use\\nduring pregnancy was not known, but that treatment did not have to\\ninvolve drugs. \"support from peers, family and friends can help,\"\\nhe said. \"if you do have to use medication, you have to weigh the\\nrisks and benefits with your doctor.\"\\n\\nbig weight gain in pregnancy can lead to heavy baby\\n\\nwomen who gain more than 40 pounds during pregnancy are about\\ntwice as likely to give birth to a heavy baby as those who gain\\nless, according to a large new study.\\n\\nmothers of babies who weigh more than about nine pounds at birth\\nare at greater risk for birth complications, and heavy babies are\\nmore likely to be overweight or obese later in life.\\n\\nit is well known that mothers with gestational diabetes are more\\nlikely to have large babies, but this study showed a strong effect\\nof weight gain even in mothers who were not diabetic.\\n\\nthe study, published in the november issue of obstetrics and\\ngynecology, used data from 41,540 births from 1995 to 2003 at a\\nlarge health plan in the northwest and hawaii.\\n\\namong women who were not diabetic, 19 percent of those who\\ngained more than 40 pounds had large babies, compared with 11\\npercent of those who gained less. nondiabetic women who put on more\\nthan 40 pounds were more likely to have a large baby than women\\ntreated for diabetes who gained less.\\n\\n\"our study provides one more good reason for women to gain the\\nideal amount of weight during pregnancy,\" said the lead author,\\ndr. teresa a. hillier, an endocrinologist at the kaiser permanente\\ncenter for health research in portland, ore., \"and for physicians\\nto do a better job counseling women about weight gain.\"\\n\\nwhile americans choose their next president, let us consider a\\nquestion more amenable to science: which candidate\\'s supporters\\nhave a better sense of humor? in strict accordance with\\nexperimental protocol, we begin by asking you to rate, on a scale\\nof 1 (not funny at all) to 9 (hilarious) the following three\\nattempts at humor:\\n\\na) jake is about to chip onto the green at his local golf course\\nwhen a long funeral procession passes by. he stops in midswing,\\ndoffs his cap, closes his eyes and bows in prayer. his playing\\ncompanion is deeply impressed. \"that\\'s the most thoughtful and\\ntouching thing i\\'ve ever seen,\" he says. jake replies, \"yeah,\\nwell, we were married 35 years.\"\\n\\nb) i think there should be something in science called the\\n\"reindeer effect.\" i don\\'t know what it would be, but i think\\nit\\'d be good to hear someone say, \"gentlemen, what we have here is\\na terrifying example of the reindeer effect.\"\\n\\nc) if you saw two guys named hambone and flippy, which one would\\nyou think liked dolphins the most? i\\'d say flippy, wouldn\\'t you?\\nyou\\'d be wrong, though. it\\'s hambone.\\n\\nthose were some of the jokes rated by nearly 300 people in\\nboston in a recent study. (you can rate some of the others at\\ntierneylab, nytimes.com/tierneylab.) the researchers picked out a\\nvariety of jokes -- good, bad, conventional, absurdist -- to look for\\ndifferences in reactions between self-described liberals and\\nconservatives.\\n\\nthey expected conservatives to like traditional jokes, like the\\none about the golfing widower, that reinforce racial and gender\\nstereotypes. and because liberals had previously been reported to\\nbe more flexible and open to new ideas, the researchers expected\\nthem to get a bigger laugh out of unconventional humor, like jack\\nhandey\\'s \"deep thoughts\" about the reindeer effect and hambone.\\n\\nindeed, the conservatives did rate the traditional golf and\\nmarriage jokes as significantly funnier than the liberals did. but\\nthey also gave higher ratings to the absurdist \"deep thoughts.\"\\nin fact, they enjoyed all kinds of humor more.\\n\\n\"i was surprised,\" said dan ariely, a psychologist at duke\\nuniversity, who collaborated on the study with elisabeth malin, a\\nstudent at mount holyoke college. \"conservatives are supposed to\\nbe more rigid and less sophisticated, but they liked even the more\\ncomplex humor.\"\\n\\ndo conservatives have more fun? should liberals start describing\\nthemselves as humor-challenged? to investigate these questions, we\\nneed to delve into the science of humor (not a funny enterprise),\\nstarting with two basic kinds of humor identified in the 1980s by\\nwillibald ruch, a psychologist who now teaches at the university of\\nzurich.\\n\\nthe first category is incongruity-resolution humor, or inc-res\\nin humor jargon. it covers traditional jokes and cartoons in which\\nthe incongruity of the punch line (the husband who misses his\\nwife\\'s funeral) can be resolved by other information (he\\'s playing\\ngolf). you can clearly get the joke, and it often reinforces\\nstereotypes (the golf-obsessed husband).\\n\\nruch and other researchers reported that this humor, with its\\norderly structure and reinforcement of stereotypes, appealed most\\nto conservatives who shunned ambiguity and complicated new ideas,\\nand who were more repressed and conformist than liberals.\\n\\nthe second category, nonsense humor, covers many \"far side\"\\ncartoons, monty python sketches and \"deep thoughts.\" the punch\\nline\\'s incongruity isn\\'t neatly resolved -- you\\'re left to enjoy the\\nambiguity and absurdity of the reindeer effect or hambone\\'s\\naffection for dolphins. this humor was reported to appeal to\\nliberals because of their \"openness to ideas\" and their tendency\\nto \"seek new experiences.\"\\n\\nbut then why didn\\'t the liberals in the boston experiment like\\nthe nonsense humor of \"deep thoughts\" as much as the\\nconservatives did? one possible explanation is that conservatives\\'\\nrigidity mattered less than another aspect of their personality.\\nrod martin, the author of \"the psychology of humor,\" said the\\nresults of the boston study might reflect another trait that has\\nbeen shown to correlate with a taste for jokes: cheerfulness.\\n\\n\"conservatives tend to be happier than liberals in general,\"\\nsaid martin, a psychologist at the university of western ontario.\\n\"a conservative outlook rationalizes social inequality, accepting\\nthe world as it is, and making it less of a threat to one\\'s\\nwell-being, whereas a liberal outlook leads to dissatisfaction with\\nthe world as it is, and a sense that things need to change before\\none can be really happy.\"\\n\\nanother possible explanation is that conservatives, or at least\\nthe ones in boston, really aren\\'t the stiffs they\\'re made out to be\\nby social scientists. when these scientists analyze conservatives,\\nthey can sound like victorians describing headhunters in borneo.\\nthey try to be objective, but it\\'s an alien culture.\\n\\nthe studies hailing liberals\\' nonconformity and \"openness to\\nideas\" have been done by social scientists working in a culture\\nthat\\'s remarkably homogenous politically. democrats outnumber\\nrepublicans by at least seven to one on social science and\\nhumanities faculties, according to studies by daniel klein, an\\neconomist at george mason university. if you\\'re a professor who\\ntruly \"seeks new experiences,\" try going into a faculty club\\ntoday and passing out mccain-palin buttons.\\n\\ncould it be that the image of conservatives as humorless,\\ndogmatic neurotics is based more on political bias than sound\\nsocial science? philip tetlock, a psychologist at the university of\\ncalifornia, berkeley, who reviews the evidence of cognitive\\ndifferences in his 2005 book, \"expert political judgment,\" said\\nthat while there were valid differences, \"liberals and\\nconservatives are roughly equally closed-minded in dealing with\\ndissonant real-world evidence.\"\\n\\nso perhaps conservatives don\\'t have a monopoly on humorless\\ndogmatism. maybe the stereotype of the dour, rigid conservative has\\nmore to do with social scientists\\' groupthink and wariness of\\noutsiders -- which, come to think of it, resembles the herding\\nbehavior of certain hoofed animals. ladies and gentlemen, what we\\nhave here is a terrifying example of the reindeer effect.\\n\\nthere was little that doctors could do for a\\n3-year-old boy brought to bangkok\\'s main children\\'s hospital two\\nweeks ago with dengue fever. like thousands before him, he had\\nreached the most dangerous phase of the disease, dengue shock\\nsyndrome, and he died of internal bleeding and organ failure three\\ndays after being admitted.\\n\\ndirectly across the street, in the u.s. army\\'s largest overseas\\nmedical research laboratory, military scientists are offering hope\\nfor future generations: a vaccine. developed after decades of\\ntrying, it is one of two experimental vaccines that experts believe\\nmay be commercially available by the middle of the next decade.\\n\\ndengue (pronounced deng-ee), a mosquito-borne illness once known\\nas breakbone fever for its intense joint and muscle pain and\\ncrushing headaches, has a relatively low death rate -- about 2.5\\npercent of hospitalized patients, the world health organization\\nreports.\\n\\nbut because patients can require constant, careful monitoring,\\nit is one of the costliest diseases in tropical countries. each\\nyear, it leads to about 500,000 hospitalizations around the world.\\n\\ndengue is seldom seen in the united states or europe, though it\\nis the second-most common cause (after malaria) of feverish\\nsymptoms for western tourists returning from developing countries.\\n\\nbut it is important to the army: american soldiers have\\ncontracted dengue as recently as the 1990s, on missions in haiti\\nand somalia. so it is one of the tropical diseases that are the\\nfocus of research here at the armed forces research institute of\\nmedical sciences, which the army has operated with the royal thai\\narmy for five decades.\\n\\nthe research center, which employs several hundred people, is\\nhoused in an unremarkable 1960s building alongside a greasy alley\\nwhere food vendors hawk fried grasshoppers and freshly mashed\\npapaya salad.\\n\\n\"there\\'s no dengue in kansas,\" said col. james w. boles, the\\ncommander at the laboratory. \"no malaria, either. that\\'s why we\\nare here.\"\\n\\nin wars past, disease has often proved a greater foe than\\nopposing armies. during the anglo-boer war in south africa in the\\nlate 19th century, more soldiers died of typhoid than in battle.\\nthousands of cases of hepatitis during the vietnam war among\\nsoldiers spurred army researchers to help develop two of the\\nvaccines now in use to prevent hepatitis a and b.\\n\\n\"all we care about is that we get a vaccine that protects\\nsoldiers,\" said lt. col. stephen j. thomas, a medical doctor who\\nis director of dengue vaccine development in the bangkok\\nlaboratory. \"fortunately, a lot of our concerns are also global\\nhealth concerns.\"\\n\\nfor many years, the leading drugs used to treat malaria were\\ndeveloped by the army. today, research on tropical diseases is\\nspread across a broader constellation; in the hunt for a dengue\\nvaccine, money and research have come from the thai government,\\nnonprofit organizations like the bill and melinda gates foundation,\\nand drug companies like glaxosmithkline, which is working with the\\narmy.\\n\\nthe other vaccine at an advanced stage of development is being\\njointly developed by the french drug company sanofi-aventis and a\\nthai university on the same bangkok street as the army lab.\\n\\n\"we\\'re further along with the dengue vaccine than we\\'ve ever\\nbeen,\" said duane j. gubler, director of the emerging infectious\\ndiseases department of the duke-n.u.s. graduate medical school in\\nsingapore. \"there\\'s a good possibility that we\\'ll have a vaccine\\nin five to seven years.\"\\n\\nthe dengue virus is transmitted mainly by a mosquito called\\naedes aegypti, which survives on human blood. aedes rarely travels\\nmore than about 100 yards from its birthplace and thrives in\\npopulated areas.\\n\\nthe mosquito can breed in something as small as a soda bottle,\\nbut its ideal breeding conditions are large containers common in\\nmany parts of southeast asia to store drinking water. (unlike other\\nmosquitoes, aedes aegypti prefers clean water, according to thomas\\nw. scott, a professor at the university of california, davis, who\\nis a leading expert on the species.)\\n\\nthe mosquito cannot survive freezing weather, and though it is\\nendemic to some parts of the united states, mainly the south,\\nexperts say good sanitation practices have kept it from spreading\\nthe dengue virus. it commonly lives inside people\\'s homes,\\nlingering in closets or curtains.\\n\\nthe world health organization estimates that 50 million people\\nare infected every year. but most of those infected, perhaps as\\nmany as 90 percent, experience only minor flulike symptoms or none\\nat all.\\n\\nin more serious cases, like that of the boy who died here last\\nmonth, symptoms include severe headaches, rapid onset of a high\\nfever, debilitating joint and muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and\\ninternal bleeding. generally, though, dengue is considered\\ntreatable as long as patients are brought to the hospital on time\\nand the disease is properly diagnosed.\\n\\nscientists believe the disease has existed for centuries -- an\\noutbreak appears to have occurred in philadelphia in 1780 -- but\\ndengue has become more common and more virulent over the past\\nhalf-century.\\n\\nin 1970, only nine countries were known to have had epidemics of\\nthe most serious form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever. by\\nthe mid-1990s that number had quadrupled, and experts say the\\ndisease is particularly well adapted to an age of air travel and\\ninternational trade.\\n\\nthere are four types of dengue virus. patients who have been\\ninfected with one of them are believed to develop immunity to that\\ntype only -- and, paradoxically, are more vulnerable to dengue\\nhemorrhagic fever if they are exposed to a second type.\\n\\nthe four types have intermixed as people carried them on\\nairplanes to far-flung places; outbreaks of the hemorrhagic fever\\nhave been traced to specific flight paths and trade routes.\\n\\n\"what we\\'ve done is provided the ideal mechanism for these\\nviruses to move around the world,\" said gubler, who has researched\\ndengue for nearly four decades.\\n\\nit was probably soldiers who caused the original spread of\\ndengue hemorrhagic fever around southeast asia, during world war\\nii.\\n\\n\"you had a movement of soldiers from england, the u.s.,\\naustralia and japan,\" said dr. suchitra nimmannitya, a pioneer in\\ndengue research who developed a handbook on how to treat the\\ndisease. \"soldiers flew from city to city.\"\\n\\na japanese scientist first isolated the virus during the war,\\nand a u.s. army physician, albert sabin, made the discovery that\\nthere were distinct virus types. (sabin went on to help develop the\\npolio vaccine.)\\n\\nthe development of a vaccine is especially difficult because it\\nwill need to counter all four types of virus.\\n\\n\"if dengue was a single virus we would have had a vaccine\\nalready, for sure,\" said dr. jean lang, director of research and\\ndevelopment at sanofi\\'s emerging vaccine program.\\n\\nsanofi\\'s dengue vaccine, which will undergo trials in 4,000\\nchildren in thailand in a few months, is one of the first vaccines\\nto be produced using genetic engineering.\\n\\nthe army\\'s vaccine, which is at a similar stage of development\\nand has been tested on volunteers in the united states, puerto rico\\nand thailand, was produced using live, attenuated viruses, a more\\ntraditional technique. the two or three doses,

could help make the vaccine affordable to people in\\ndeveloping countries.\\n\\nfor a man whose scholarly specialty is one of the grimmest\\ntopics on earth -- extinction -- stuart l. pimm is remarkably\\nchipper. on a recent morning, while visiting new york city, pimm, a\\n59-year-old zoologist, was full of warm stories about the many\\nplaces he travels: south africa, madagascar and even south florida,\\nwhich he visits as part of an effort to save the endangered florida\\npanther. fewer than 100 survive in the wild. in 2006, pimm, who\\nholds the doris duke professorship of conservation ecology at duke\\nuniversity, won the heineken prize for environmental sciences, the\\nnobel of the ecology world.\\n\\nq: how does a person make extinction the centerpiece of a\\nprofessional life?\\n\\npimm: in 1978, i went to hawaii, supposedly a tropical paradise.\\ni am an enthusiastic birder, and i looked forward to getting into\\nthe lush forest to view the abundant flora and fauna the islands\\nwere famous for. here you had this rich island chain, out in the\\nmidst of the pacific, full of wondrous birds and plants -- a place\\nsupposedly richer in natural diversity than even the galapagos.\\n\\ni had brought with me field guides to the fauna and flora, all\\npublished in the early 1970s. yet once in the hawaiian forest, i\\nhad a shock: my books were listing species that were extinct -- or\\nabout to become so. i was in the forest six days a week and i kept\\nthinking, \"if i give it enough time, i\\'ll certainly see most of\\nthe species still left.\" but i saw very little. in fact, in hawaii\\ntoday, i\\'d say there are only about 10 remaining native land bird\\nspecies, with another 10 clinging to survival.\\n\\nso suddenly this extinction business seemed very real. whenever\\nyou\\'d meet biologists over coffee, there\\'d be the same\\nconversation: \"do you ever wonder what hawaii was like before,\\nwith 150 species of birds and 1,500 species of plants?\" that\\nchanged my life.\\n\\nq: how did it do that?\\n\\npimm: well, i realized that extinction was something that as a\\nscientist, i could study. i could ask, \"why do species go\\nextinct?\" and \"how fast does it happen?\" once armed with that\\ninformation, one might do something about it.\\n\\ni now spend a fair amount of time in washington, working for\\nlaws to protect species. i train young people to do the same. i\\noften tell my students that if they want to become environmental\\nbiologists, they have to be prepared to go out into the field at\\ndawn to collect their data and then dress up in a suit in the\\nafternoon to meet the visiting politician.\\n\\nq: which would you say are, at this moment, the most endangered\\nof the world\\'s creatures?\\n\\npimm: there are too many to name. something like 12 percent of\\nall birds, a third of all amphibians and, likely, similarly large\\nnumbers of plants are in serious danger, i\\'d say. what\\'s more,\\nabout 1 percent of all species on the planet are in such trouble\\nthat if we don\\'t do the right things immediately they will be gone\\nin a decade.\\n\\nthe river dolphin in china was declared extinct just last year.\\nanother small dolphin in the sea of cortez is in immediate danger.\\n\\nq: what can one person do to stop extinctions?\\n\\npimm: one of the things i\\'ve done is start an ngo -- a\\nnongovernmental organization -- called savingspecies.org. and it\\ndoes what its title suggests. we\\'ve been working with local\\nconservation groups and governments in brazil and madagascar doing\\na variety of projects that we hope will halt the potential\\nextinctions there.\\n\\none of the things we know is that many endangered animals live\\nover large areas. but their populations become fragmented because\\nof farming and development. the remaining creatures can\\'t find a\\ndate on a saturday night. so we\\'ve been trying to buy up degraded\\nland around their broken environments and try to create land\\ncorridors for the wildlife.\\n\\nq: have you had any successes yet?\\n\\npimm: yes. on the atlantic coast of brazil, we\\'ve been trying to\\nhelp save the golden lion tamarin, an endangered primate about the\\nsize of a house cat. last year, with the involvement of local\\nconservationist groups, we helped purchase about 270 acres of\\ncattle pasture that separated two patches of their habitat. this\\nformer pasture is now being replanted with trees. the two areas\\nwill soon be bridged, and it will be possible for lonely hearts to\\nmeet members of the opposite sex and go forth and multiply.\\n\\nin another south american region i won\\'t name here, there have\\nbeen a lot of illegal logs taken. why? because a local godfather\\nthere was getting kickbacks from loggers. my friends and i decided\\nwe\\'d give him a bit more money and we stopped the illegal logging.\\ni may burn in hell forever for paying protection, but it did help\\nthe animals and the indigenous people, who were not subjected to a\\nlot of bad things. in terms of what we got for the money, it was a\\nvery good deal.\\n\\nq: your group has been doing a lot of work with indigenous\\ntribes. why is that important?\\n\\npimm: because when you set aside indigenous reserves, it reduces\\ndeforestation.\\n\\nthere\\'s another project in northern amazonia that my group has\\nbeen involved in. this particular area is inhabited by indigenous\\npeoples who have clear title to the land in their village.\\nrecently, settlers came into the area, wanting to turn the forests\\noutside of the village -- the very places where these people hunt\\nand fish -- into rice fields. their claim was that no one owned the\\nforests. so my brazilian students and a local catholic mission have\\nbeen teaching the tribe\\'s teenagers the use of modern global\\npositioning technologies -- gps. the idea is that gps can help them\\nrecord where they hunt and fish and that will help them define the\\nforest land as theirs. so here\\'s an example of when we help the\\nlocal people maintain their traditional ways, we\\'re helping the\\nflora and the fauna survive.\\n\\nq: how do you finance savingspecies.org?\\n\\npimm: we raise money in the traditional way, but we\\'re also\\nselling symbolic carbon offsets to sympathetic donors.\\n\\nas you know, when you restore forests, you soak up co2 from the\\natmosphere. there are people who\\'d like to be carbon neutral --\\nthey\\'d like not to burn any more carbon than they are soaking up.\\nso if someone buys an airline ticket and feels badly about all the\\ncarbon they\\'re putting into the atmosphere during that flight, we\\nsell them very beautiful, very cheap offsets from the forest\\nrestoration we have done.\\n\\nwe hope that this kind of swap will eventually become a\\nfinancial obligation in a lot of the world.\\n\\nq: are you religious?\\n\\npimm: i\\'m a believing christian. \"god so loved the cosmos that\\nhe gave his only son.\" that\\'s an injunction from st. john. to me,\\nthis says that christians have an obligation to look after the\\nworld -- stewardship. we cannot pointlessly drive species to\\nextinction and destroy forests and oceans. when we do that, we are\\ndestroying god\\'s creation.\\n\\nthat said, i\\'m not a vegetarian. i like a good steak now and\\nthen. do i go out and slaughter cattle? yep.\\n\\na new virus that causes fatal hemorrhagic fevers has been\\ndiscovered in southern africa. it killed four people in south\\nafrica and sickened a fifth, but health authorities believe the\\noutbreak has been contained.\\n\\nthe virus is a member of the arenavirus family, which also\\nincludes the causes of lassa fever in west africa and several south\\namerican fevers. while new viruses are often found in animals -- a\\nnew blue-tongue virus was found in swiss goats last month, for\\nexample -- it is relatively rare to discover one fatal to humans,\\nlike the sars coronavirus in 2002 or the sin nombre hantavirus in\\n1993.\\n\\nhow the first victim was infected is unknown, but arenaviruses\\nare common in rodents; their dried urine, inhaled while sweeping,\\ncan transmit infection.\\n\\nconfirmation that it is a new virus was made by the national\\ninstitute for communicable diseases in south africa and by the\\ncenters for disease control and prevention in atlanta.\\n\\nthe first victim was cecilia van deventer, a safari tour booker\\nin lusaka, zambia, who fell ill on sept. 2 and was airlifted to\\njohannesburg. she apparently infected hannes els, the paramedic who\\naccompanied her, and gladys mthembu, a nurse tending her at the\\nmorningside medi-clinic in a johannesburg suburb.\\n\\nthe fourth to die was maria mokubung, who cleaned the room where\\nvan deventer died sept. 14. according to south african news\\nreports, the last death was originally misdiagnosed because the\\nvictim had tuberculosis and meningitis and was hemorrhaging and\\nconfused when her family sought medical care.\\n\\na fifth victim, a nurse who cared for els, was in critical\\ncondition but responded to early treatment with the antiviral drug\\nribavirin.\\n\\nthe disease progresses from flu symptoms to diarrhea and a\\nmeasles-like rash and then to respiratory and circulatory collapse.\\n\\nthe authorities said they knew of no new cases but would wait\\nuntil 21 days from the last infection to declare the outbreak over.\\n\\ndisease detective work was difficult, south african news media\\nsaid. because van deventer feared needles, little blood was drawn\\nfrom her in zambia; also, her body was cremated before the alarm\\nwas raised. tissue samples from later victims had to be taken\\ncarefully in a high-security laboratory that was under renovation\\nand had to be reopened.\\n\\narenaviruses are named for their round sandy granules; \"arena\"\\nis latin for sand. a name for the new virus is being debated;\\nzambian authorities do not want one that will hurt tourism.\\n\\naccording to a government news service, zambia\\'s first response\\nto the outbreak was to close its border with congo, the former\\nzaire, where ebola fever, which is not related, originated.\\n\\nstill puzzling over how warm and wet mars may have once been,\\nscientists are now seeing global mineralogical signs that the\\nplanet was at least occasionally wet for the first 2 billion years\\nof its existence.\\n\\nin an article in the november issue of the journal geology,\\nscientists working with data from nasa\\'s mars reconnaissance\\norbiter report that they have spotted widespread deposits of opals\\nand related minerals on the surface of mars.\\n\\nopals belong to a class of minerals known as hydrated silicas,\\nwith water molecules wedged into silicon-based minerals like\\nquartz. the formation of hydrated silicas requires liquid water.\\n\\nmost interesting is that the opal deposits lie in areas that\\nappear to have formed only about 2 billion years ago. previously,\\nspacecraft have detected other water-bearing minerals like clays in\\nregions that date back more than 3.5 billion years. mars, like the\\nother planets in the solar system, is about 4.5 billion years old.\\n\\n\"the water was more widespread and extended to younger times,\"\\nsaid scott l. murchie, a staff scientist at johns hopkins\\' applied\\nphysics laboratory and the principal investigator for the orbiter\\'s\\nspectrometer, which found the opal evidence.\\n\\nin july, murchie and other scientists reported that the orbiter\\nhad detected vast deposits of the claylike minerals on the older\\nterrains. images also showed ancient lakebeds with accumulations of\\nthe minerals, indicating standing water persisted for thousands of\\nyears.\\n\\nthe presence of water on mars has been known for many years; its\\nice caps, easily visible from space, are largely made of frozen\\nwater. the unanswered question is how often the ice has melted. the\\nphoenix mars lander, now nearing the end of its six-month mission,\\nis exploring whether the arctic ice has melted in recent millennia.\\n\\nthe most intriguing possibility is that mars, when it was less\\nthan a billion years old, was warm enough for lakes and oceans of\\nliquid water -- and with that, the possibility of life. the planet\\'s\\nlandforms offer compelling evidence for flowing water: immense\\ncanyons and channels, dried-up river deltas.\\n\\n\"i think most people agree there was lots of water on the\\nsurface in the first few hundred million years,\" said maria zuber,\\na professor of geophysics at the massachusetts institute of\\ntechnology. \"it\\'s later on when i get confused, although i\\'m\\nconfused about the whole thing. that\\'s what makes it interesting.\"\\n\\nsome scientists have suggested that rare catastrophic floods\\ncarved the landforms, either in the aftermath of an impact by an\\nasteroid or comet or by underground water -- melted by residual\\nvolcanic warmth -- bursting to the surface.\\n\\nthose who believe that liquid water was more persistent were\\nnonetheless perplexed when earlier spacecraft detected only small\\nquantities of carbonates, minerals that should have formed in large\\namounts from reactions involving carbon dioxide and liquid water.\\n\\nbut data collected by the two mars rovers, spirit and\\nopportunity, show a highly acidic environment that prevented the\\nformation of carbonates. \"that part of the story is fairly well\\nagreed upon,\" zuber said.\\n\\nthe two rovers have also found signs of past water. opportunity\\nfound hydrated sulfates in the meridiani planum rocks; spirit found\\nopal-like minerals similar to those spotted by the reconnaissance\\norbiter from space.\\n\\nbut planetary scientists are still trying to explain the\\ntransition of mars from lots of water to today\\'s cold and dry\\nclimate. in fact, they are still trying to explain how it ever had\\nlots of liquid water. even if young mars was enshrouded in a thick\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide belched by giant volcanoes,\\nclimatologists have had trouble coaxing enough global warming in\\ntheir computer simulations to push temperatures above the melting\\npoint of ice.\\n\\njames f. kasting, a professor of geosciences at penn state,\\nbelieves he may have figured out how to warm up mars. in research\\nthat he will present in december at a meeting of the american\\ngeophysical union, the key may be nitrogen dioxide.\\n\\nin his climate models, carbon dioxide did act as a greenhouse\\ngas, trapping heat near the surface, but it also reflected shorter\\nwavelengths of light back into space, limiting the amount of\\nheating. his models peaked at about minus-40 degrees fahrenheit.\\nnitrogen dioxide, which is also released by volcanic eruptions,\\nreduces the reflectivity of mars in the models. with more light\\nabsorbed, temperatures jumped 100 degrees. \"that would be more\\nthan you need,\" kasting said.\\n\\nhe said he still needed to demonstrate that the nitrogen dioxide\\nwould mix throughout the atmosphere rather than remain in pockets\\naround the volcanoes.\\n\\neven if scientists figure out the water question, they have\\nanother problem: what happened to the martian air? the climate\\nmodels suggest early mars had an atmosphere denser than earth\\'s.\\nnow, it\\'s a faint wisp.\\n\\n\"well, we don\\'t know,\" zuber said. \"one day we\\'re going to\\nnail that one. there\\'s a whole bunch of things on my list of things\\nto do.\"\\n\\neconomists, health researchers and consumers are struggling to\\nanswer that question as food prices rise and the economy slumps.\\nthe world bank says nearly a billion people around the world live\\non a dollar a day, or even less; in the united states, the daily\\nfood-stamp allowance is typically just a few dollars per person,\\nwhile the average american eats $7 worth of food per day.\\n\\neven middle-class people struggle to put healthful food on the\\ntable. studies show that junk foods tend to cost less than fruits,\\nvegetables and other healthful foods, whose prices continue to\\nrise.\\n\\nthis fall a couple in encinitas, calif., conducted their own\\nexperiment to find out what it was like to live for a month on just\\na dollar a day for food. overnight, their diets changed\\nsignificantly. the budget forced them to give up many store-bought\\nfoods and dinners out. even bread and canned refried beans were too\\nexpensive.\\n\\ninstead, the couple -- christopher greenslate, 28, and kerri\\nleonard, 29, both high school social studies teachers -- bought raw\\nbeans, rice, cornmeal and oatmeal in bulk, and made their own bread\\nand tortillas. fresh fruits and vegetables weren\\'t an option.\\nleonard\\'s mother was so worried about scurvy, a result of vitamin c\\ndeficiency, that they made room in their budget for tang orange\\ndrink mix. (they don\\'t eat meat -- not that they could have afforded\\nit.)\\n\\nbreakfast consisted of oatmeal; lunch was a peanut butter and\\njelly sandwich. dinner often consisted of beans, rice and homemade\\ntortillas. homemade pancakes were affordable, but syrup was not; a\\nlocal restaurant gave them a few free syrup packets.\\n\\none of the biggest changes was the time they had to spend in\\nmeal preparation.\\n\\n\"if you\\'re buying raw materials, you\\'re spending more time\\npreparing things,\" greenslate said. \"we\\'d come home after working\\n10 to 11 hours and have to roll out tortillas. if you\\'re already\\nreally hungry at that point, it\\'s tough.\"\\n\\nwhile he lost weight on the budget diet, greenslate said, the\\nlarger issue was his lack of energy. during the experiment he was\\nno longer able to work out at the gym.\\n\\na few times they found a bag of carrots or lettuce that was\\nwithin their budget, but produce was usually too expensive. they\\nforaged for lemons on the trees in their neighborhood to squeeze\\njuice into their water.\\n\\nleonard said that after the 30-day experiment, one of the first\\nfoods she ate was a strawberry. \"i almost cried,\" she said.\\n\\nthe couple acknowledged that the experiment was something of a\\nluxury, given that many people have no choice about how much to\\nspend on food.\\n\\n\"people in our situation have the leisure to be concerned about\\nissues like this,\" leonard said. \"if we were actually living in\\nthis situation, i would not be taking the time to be concerned\\nabout what i could and could not have; i\\'d be worried about\\nsurvival.\"\\n\\nresearchers say the experiment reflects many of the challenges\\nthat poor people actually face. when food stamps and income checks\\nrun low toward the end of the month, they often do scrape by on a\\ndollar a day or less. but many people don\\'t know how to prepare\\nfoods from scratch, or lack the time.\\n\\n\"you have to know how to cook beans and rice, how to make\\ntortillas, how to soak lentils,\" said adam drewnowski, director of\\nthe center for public health nutrition at the university of\\nwashington. \"many people don\\'t have the knowledge or the time if\\nthey\\'re working two jobs.\"\\n\\nlast year, drewnowski led a study, published in the journal of\\nthe american dietetic association, comparing the prices of 370\\nfoods sold at supermarkets in the seattle area. the study showed\\nthat \"energy dense\" junk foods, which pack the most calories and\\nfewest nutrients per gram, were far less expensive than\\nnutrient-rich, lower-calorie foods like fruits and vegetables. the\\nprices of the most healthful foods surged 19.5 percent over the\\ntwo-year study period, while the junk food prices dropped 1.8\\npercent.\\n\\nobesity researchers worry that these trends will push consumers\\ntoward less healthful foods. \"the message for this year and next\\nyear is going to be affordable nutrition,\" drewnowski said. \"it\\'s\\nnot the food pyramid, it\\'s the budget pyramid.\"\\n\\nthe experiment in california was hardly the first of its kind,\\nthough the teachers\\' budget was tighter than

public health service\\nduring world war ii to warn the troops about the dangers of casual\\nsex, is on display as part of a retrospective of 20th-century\\nhealth posters from the permanent collection of the national\\nlibrary of medicine.\\n\\ntitled \"an iconography of contagion,\" the exhibition features\\nwork from numerous countries on an array of diseases, among them\\nsyphilis, malaria, tuberculosis and aids. the posters are on\\ndisplay at the national academy of sciences in washington through\\ndec. 19.\\n\\nmuch of the exhibition suggests a mash-up of advertising and\\npublic health. the posters tried to convey the danger of disease\\nand get people to change their behavior, said the curator, michael\\nsappol, a historian at the library of medicine, part of the\\nnational institutes of health.\\n\\nbut \"they\\'re also about the pleasure of the image,\" he\\ncontinued, adding, \"there have been some very sexy, colorful,\\nplayful posters about some very serious diseases.\"\\n\\nthe visual world underwent rapid changes in the late 19th and\\nearly 20th centuries. newspapers featured larger headlines and more\\ndrawings and photographs. the advertising industry integrated text\\nand images, and it turned to behavioral science to sharpen its\\npitches.\\n\\nat the same time, public health groups like the national\\ntuberculosis association, founded in 1904, took some cues from\\nadvertising and began to rely on mass communication, with\\npamphlets, posters and, later, films and radio spots. for diseases\\nlike tuberculosis that lacked effective treatments, efforts to\\npromote screening and change people\\'s behavior were especially\\nimportant. \"media campaigns were themselves seen as magic\\nbullets,\" sappol said.\\n\\nin an iconic poster from around 1940, a mother and two children\\ngather around an armchair, smiling, as the father reads a\\nnewspaper. an urban throng, in monochromatic red, appears in the\\nbackground. \"tuberculosis undiscovered endangers you: discover the\\nunknown spreaders!\" reads the caption.\\n\\n\"at the time, many people who had tb, including some who were\\ncontagious, were unaware that they were infected,\" said dr. mary\\ne. wilson, an associate professor of global health and population\\nat the harvard school of public health. a large number of them were\\nidentified through mass screening using x-rays. (many were exposed\\nto large doses of radiation that would be unacceptable today, she\\nadded.)\\n\\nanother poster, created in china in 1935, was intended to\\ndiscourage spitting, which could spread tb. the image shows a man\\nin traditional dress walking past a group of playing children. a\\nline extends from the man\\'s mouth to a clump of spittle on the\\nground; from there, an arrow points to a pool of pink bacteria\\nmagnified under a microscope.\\n\\nthe caption reads, in part: \"tb is rampant in our country\\nbecause of the error of spitting anywhere. this is unforgivable!\"\\nit continues: \"spit into a handkerchief and boil it, or spit into\\npaper and burn it. this not only ensures virtue but is a gift to\\nmankind.\"\\n\\nthe poster includes a symbol that resembles that of the national\\ntuberculosis association in the united states -- a vertical line\\nwith two horizontal crosses. in the chinese version, the edges of\\nthe cross are curved upward, resembling a pagoda.\\n\\na similar message was promoted in many countries. in a danish\\nposter from 1947, the emphasis is on screening. a couple, shown as\\na shadowy form with green and red highlights, strolls arm in arm,\\nwearing hats that could be merry or devilish. \"tuberculosis\\nexamination -- a citizen\\'s duty,\" reads the text.\\n\\nthe poster has \"a beautiful, creamy texture\" and was \"part of\\nthe danish enchantment with modernity, both in health\\ninfrastructure and in aesthetics,\" sappol said. \"it seduces you\\ninto paying attention.\"\\n\\nin the 1960s, the enchantment with health posters declined, at\\nleast in the united states. \"there was a general feeling among the\\npublic that we\\'ve got the polio vaccine, penicillin, ddt and other\\nmagic bullets, and that\\'s going to conquer disease,\" sappol said.\\n\\nbut that confidence plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s with\\nhiv/aids, which brought about a renaissance of public health\\nposters, said john parascandola, a former historian for the public\\nhealth service. activist groups like act up and gran fury in the\\nunited states and the terrence higgins trust in britain campaigned\\nto raise awareness about the disease.\\n\\none poster from the mid-1980s shows a muscular man leaning down\\nto perform oral sex on a partner of ambiguous gender. a tattooed\\ntiger bulges on his shoulder. the poster, which reads \"discover\\nsafer sex,\" is from the terrence higgins trust\\'s \"love sexy, love\\nsafe\" campaign. the text notes that safer sex can also prevent\\nunwanted pregnancy, suggesting that the campaign hoped to draw in\\nheterosexuals.\\n\\naids posters tended to be less moralistic than many earlier\\nones, said wilson, who noted that the world war ii campaigns\\nagainst syphilis and gonorrhea often treated the woman \"as the\\nvillain, the temptress, and men almost as innocent bystanders.\"\\n\\nby contrast, she said, while aids patients were often\\nstigmatized in the broader society, the major public health\\ncampaigns \"tried very hard to work against that stigma.\"\\n\\nultimately, the posters tried to sell ideas to specific\\naudiences, parascandola said. they were a compelling form of\\nadvertising -- and perhaps they still are.\\n\\nfor those who love the civic cheer and lukewarm coffee of their\\nlocal polling place, an absentee ballot has all the appeal of a tax\\nform. the paperwork, the miniature type, the search (in some\\nstates) for a notary public: it\\'s a tedium bath, and pam\\nfleischaker, a lifelong democrat from oklahoma city, had every\\nreason to take a pass this year.\\n\\nfleischaker, 62, was in new york recovering from a heart\\ntransplant, for one. and in her home state, the democratic\\ncandidate, sen. barack obama, was polling hopelessly behind his\\nopponent, sen. john mccain. she mailed in her absentee packet\\nanyway, and hounded her two children, also in new york, to do the\\nsame.\\n\\n\"that one vote isn\\'t going to be decisive makes no difference\\nto me,\" fleischaker said in a telephone interview last week.\\n\"your vote is your voice, and there\\'s more power in it than in\\nmost of the things we do. it\\'s a lost pleasure, the feeling of that\\npower.\"\\n\\nin recent years psychologists and neuroscientists have tried to\\nget a handle on how people make voting decisions. they have taken\\nbrain scans, to see how certain messages or images activate emotion\\ncenters. they have spun out theories of racial bias, based on\\npeople\\'s split-second reactions to white and black faces. they have\\ndressed up partisan political stereotypes in scientific jargon,\\ndescribing conservatives as \"inordinately fearful and craving\\norder,\" and liberals as \"open-minded and tolerant.\"\\n\\nnone of which has helped predict people\\'s behavior in elections\\nany more than a half-decent phone survey. the problem is not only\\nsketchy science, some experts say; it\\'s that researchers don\\'t\\nagree on the answer to a more fundamental question: why do people\\nvote at all?\\n\\n\"there\\'s a longstanding literature looking at why any rational\\nperson would vote, when the chances of actually influencing an\\nelection are about the same as getting hit by lightning,\" said\\njohn londregan, a professor of politics and international affairs\\nat princeton. \"in most theoretical models, it\\'s hard to get a\\npredicted turnout above one. that is, one voter.\"\\n\\nyet new models have done better, predicting elections with\\nturnouts closer to the nation\\'s average of about 50 percent of\\neligible voters. they have also revealed some of the basic motives\\nunderlying both personal and group decisions about when to vote and\\nwhy.\\n\\ncasting a ballot clearly provides a value far higher than its\\npolitical impact. the benefit may include side payments -- say, the\\nbarbecues and camaraderie of a campaign, or the tiny possibility\\nthat a single vote may be decisive.\\n\\nbut recent research suggests that it has more to do with civic\\nduty and the maintenance of moral self-image. in a series of\\nexperiments, researchers from northwestern university and the\\nuniversity of california, berkeley, have had study participants\\nplay a simple election game involving monetary rewards. a group of\\ndesignated voters cast their vote for choice a, an equal\\ndistribution of money among voters and nonvoters in the study; or\\nb, a payout to be split only among the designated voters -- a\\nsmaller group, so a higher amount. it cost money to vote, and\\nparticipants could abstain at no cost.\\n\\nthe study authors, led by sean gailmard at berkeley, called\\nchoice a \"ethical\" and choice b \"selfish.\" they found that\\nethical voting ran highest, at about 20 percent, when individual\\nvotes were least likely to affect the outcome. selfish voting ran\\nhighest, also about 20 percent, when individuals\\' choices were most\\nlikely to change the outcome.\\n\\nthis finding could explain why people might vote against a local\\ntax increase but for a congressional candidate who was likely to\\nraise their income taxes: their vote carries far less value in a\\nnational race than in a local one.\\n\\nthis study and others also imply that there is a core of voters\\nwho not only turn out at the polls but also cast their ballot for\\nthe candidate or proposal they believe represents the larger good.\\nthis makes sense to those who study the evolution of group\\nbehavior. small communities often have a scattering of people who\\nstand up and do the right thing; their compensation is the private\\nknowledge that they are willing to pay some cost to do what they\\nbelieve is right, even if that price amounts to standing out in the\\ncold for 15 minutes waiting to pull a lever.\\n\\n\"it may be a form of identity construction for individuals,\"\\ngailmard wrote in an e-mail message. \"or it could be a duty to do\\nthe right thing, or a social norm.\"\\n\\nfleischaker, the absentee oklahoma voter, put it this way: \"who\\nare we to ask others to do things for this country, small or very\\nlarge, like fighting in a war, if we ourselves are not going to\\ntake the trouble to vote?\"\\n\\nthe military analogy is not overdrawn, londregan says. in a 2006\\npaper, \"voting as a credible threat,\" he and andrea vindigni of\\nprinceton argue from historical and sociological evidence that at\\ntimes of deep division, elections function as an x-ray into the\\nstrength of the opposition, the number of people willing to bear a\\ncost to have their way. in the extreme, election returns prompt\\nfactions on the brink of civil war to reassess their chances and\\nnegotiate -- making communities, small and large, far more stable\\nand adaptive.\\n\\n\"we started to see that elections function as a kind of sat\\nscore to show what kind of guerrilla you\\'d be,\" londregan said.\\n\"they\\'re a way to see how many people would actually fight to\\noppose a policy -- and how much is just bravado.\"\\n\\ndutiful voters know all this, at some level, no matter how they\\ndefine the larger good. they think more broadly about what others\\nof their stripe will do, spending more effort if they feel their\\nhome team will be underrepresented, political scientists have\\nfound.\\n\\nby taking into account such calculations, as well as ethical\\nvoting, the costs of casting a ballot and other parameters, timothy\\nfeddersen and alvaro sandroni of northwestern university --\\ngailmard\\'s co-authors on the ethical voting research -- have\\ndesigned a model that accurately predicted turnout in several local\\ntexas elections.\\n\\n\"the model predicts that in states where the election is close,\\nturnout will be high among all groups,\" feddersen said, adding\\nthat in the toss-up states, \"partisans are less likely to vote\\nwhen they are in the majority and more likely to vote when they are\\nin the minority,\" or expect to lose.\\n\\nin short, expect the race in states like new york and oklahoma\\nto be closer than polls show, not because of hidden racism or\\n\"inordinate fear\" but because many people find it satisfying to\\nstand up and be counted -- even if they\\'re doing the counting for\\nthemselves.\\n\\na federal court has blocked the bush\\nadministration\\'s effort to save money on medicare by paying for\\nonly the least expensive treatments for particular conditions.\\n\\ncongress sets medicare payment rates and never intended to give\\nofficials broad discretion to alter them, the court said in an\\nimportant test case last month.\\n\\nthe case, closely followed by medicare officials and consumer\\nadvocates, involved drugs used to treat chronic obstructive\\npulmonary disease.\\n\\njudge henry h. kennedy jr. of u.s. district court here said the\\npolicy of paying for only \"the least costly alternative\" was not\\npermitted under the medicare law.\\n\\nthe administration\\'s position would give the health and human\\nservices secretary \"enormous discretion\" to determine the amount\\npaid for every item and service covered by medicare, without\\nreference to the detailed formulas set by congress, kennedy said.\\n\"this flies in the face of the detailed statutory provisions,\" he\\nadded.\\n\\nover the years, medicare officials have often tried to adopt\\nregulations that allow them to consider cost in deciding whether\\nthe program should cover various goods and services. health care\\nproviders, manufacturers and some patients\\' advocates have resisted\\nthese efforts, saying that coverage decisions should be made based\\non clinical effectiveness and not cost.\\n\\n\"we are disappointed with the ruling and continue to believe\\nthat our policy is supported by the statute,\" peter l. ashkenaz, a\\nspokesman for the federal centers for medicare and medicaid\\nservices, said monday. \"we are still considering our options and\\nnext steps.\"\\n\\nfederal health officials said the decision would make it more\\ndifficult to rein in medicare costs.\\n\\nkennedy found that medicare and some of its contractors had\\nunlawfully limited payments for duoneb, an inhalation drug taken\\nthrough a nebulizer, which turns the medicine into a fine mist.\\n\\nthe drug, made by dey, a unit of mylan inc., makes breathing\\neasier by opening up the bronchial tubes. a single dose provides a\\ncombination of two commonly prescribed bronchodilators, albuterol\\nand ipratropium.\\n\\ncongress set forth the touchstone for medicare coverage in a\\n1965 law that created the program. the law generally prohibits\\npayment for items and services that are \"not reasonable and\\nnecessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury, or\\nto improve the functioning of a malformed body member.\"\\n\\nif an item is covered, the payment rate is specified in other\\nparts of the law.\\n\\nthe bush administration argued that medicare officials had the\\nright to decide whether the expense incurred for a given item, not\\njust the item itself, was \"reasonable and necessary.\"\\n\\nkennedy said this argument \"does not make sense\" because\\ncongress went to great lengths to establish payment rates.\\n\\nsimilar disputes have come up over other treatments.\\n\\nanother pharmaceutical company, sepracor, has for years\\nchallenged the government\\'s authority to use the \"least costly\\nalternative\" as a basis for setting reimbursement rates for\\nxopenex, prescribed for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary\\ndisease.\\n\\nin a friend-of-the-court brief, sepracor said that congress had\\nset the payment rate at 106 percent of the average sales price.\\n\"congress consciously chose to entrust the amount of reimbursement\\nto the market, not to a government agency or its contractors,\" the\\ncompany said in its brief.\\n\\npatrick morrisey, a lawyer representing sepracor, said, \"if you\\nextend the agency\\'s logic to its natural conclusion, congress would\\nnever need to pass any payment laws and policies.\"\\n\\nscott t. williams, vice president of men\\'s health network, an\\neducation and advocacy group, said the decision would be \"a\\nspringboard to help ensure that prostate-cancer patients have\\naccess to drugs like lupron and zoladex, rather than being forced\\nto use the least costly alternative products.\"\\n\\nwilliams said that if medicare paid only for the least costly\\ndrugs, low-income and minority patients might not have access to\\nmore expensive treatments deemed appropriate by their doctors.\\n\\na wave of violence, including an assassination attempt\\nagainst a deputy oil minister, swept through baghdad and\\nneighboring diyala province on monday.\\n\\nalso on monday, parliament passed a bill that would grant the\\ncountry\\'s embattled minorities fewer guaranteed seats in upcoming\\nelections than the united nations had recommended.\\n\\nthe prospects for enactment of the bill, which requires the\\napproval of iraq\\'s executive council, are unclear. in september,\\nparliament passed a law on provincial elections but, in a\\ncontroversial action, deleted from it an article dealing with\\nrepresentation of iraq\\'s many minorities.\\n\\nthe council, composed of the country\\'s president and two vice\\npresidents, signed that measure into law early last month but\\ndirected parliament to pass separate legislation on the issue.\\n\\nin the most lethal attack of the day, 6 people were killed and\\n20 wounded when two roadside bombs exploded in quick succession in\\nfront of the headquarters of the ministry of interior\\'s criminal\\ninvestigations unit in baghdad\\'s central karada district, according\\nto an official at the ministry who spoke anonymously because he was\\nnot authorized to speak to the media.\\n\\nthe deadlier bomb was planted in front of the protective\\nconcrete wall ringing the government building. the other was about\\n70 yards away. two badly burned bodies lay on the street shortly\\nafter the explosions.\\n\\n\"i cannot believe what happened,\" said a bewildered policeman\\nat the scene, who said he had worked for the directorate for 35\\nyears. \"who can plant a bomb in this fortified area in the\\npresence of police patrols?\"\\n\\nthe assassination attempt against the deputy oil minister came\\nabout 30 minutes before the karada blasts. the official, saheb\\nsalman qutub, was wounded, along with his driver, when a bomb\\nplanted in his car exploded, according to a ministry spokesman,\\nasim jihad.\\n\\nthe explosion occurred as qutub was getting into the car at his\\nhome in the northern baghdad neighborhood of atafiya to go to work,\\njihad said.\\n\\na japanese delegation visited the ministry monday to discuss\\ninvestments in iraq\\'s lucrative oil and gas sectors.\\n\\nin other violence, a huge car bomb exploded in a parking lot\\nnext to the headquarters of the local government in baqouba in\\ndiyala province, killing at least three people and wounding 13,\\nincluding eight police officers, according to security and\\nprovincial officials.\\n\\nthe blast destroyed 22 vehicles and badly damaged several nearby\\ngovernment buildings.\\n\\nibrahim bajlan, who heads the diyala provincial council, said\\nthe attack was proof that the situation in the province remained\\n\"fragile\" and that the government\\'s lauded recent security\\noperation in diyala had \"only accomplished a fraction of its\\ngoals.\"\\n\\nfourteen other people were wounded in four other bombing attacks\\nin baghdad, according to the official of the interior ministry.\\n\\nin the northern city of mosul, a child was killed and five other\\npeople wounded in a roadside bombing aimed at a police patrol,\\nsecurity sources said.\\n\\nthe attacks came a day after u.s. and iraqi military officials\\nsaid that overall levels of violence across the country were at\\ntheir lowest level since may 2004.\\n\\nin passing legislation that could stoke further tensions between\\niraq\\'s fractious ethnic and sectarian groups, parliament voted to\\nguarantee minorities significantly fewer seats on provincial\\ncouncils than had been recommended by the u.n. assistance mission\\nfor iraq.\\n\\nthe bill would give christians a single seat on councils in\\nbaghdad, basra and nineveh, instead of the three seats in baghdad\\nand three in nineveh, as well as one in basra, that were proposed\\nby the u.n.mission.\\n\\nthe yazidis, a kurdish-speaking minority who, like christians,\\nhave been reeling from attacks and displacement since the start of\\nthe war in 2003, were given one seat in nineveh, instead of the\\nthree proposed. two other minorities, the shabaks and the sabeans,\\nwere given one seat apiece.\\n\\nthe new bill is supposed to be a compromise following the\\ncontroversy that erupted in late september when parliament passed\\nthe elections law but deleted an article that had provided 13 seats\\nin six provinces for iraqi christians, yazidis and other\\nminorities. the new bill grants only six seats. the u.n. mission\\nhad proposed a total of 12.\\n\\nyounadim kanna, one of two christians in parliament, described\\nmonday\\'s vote as \"a great insult.\"\\n\\n\"there is no desire to respect minorities as the indigenous\\npeople of this country,\" mr. kanna said. \"this quota is simply a\\nface-saving mechanism by the ruling parties.\"\\n\\nelections are expected to be conducted in most of the country\\nearly next year.\\n\\ngrowing up in connecticut,\\nalexandra hubbard did not want to be joan of arc. she wanted to be\\njane goodall. but instead of chimpanzees, her animals would turn\\nout to be killer whales.\\n\\nin 1984, 26 years old and armed only with a bachelor\\'s degree\\nand enthusiasm for her task, she moved to the broughton\\narchipelago, in the queen charlotte strait of british columbia,\\nwhere the whales, or orcas, were abundant. she and her husband,\\nrobin morton, a canadian filmmaker, lived on a 65-foot sailboat and\\nfollowed the orcas in an inflatable boat with a shelter in the\\nback, stocked with legos and books for their son, jarret.\\n\\nshe came to know the archipelago\\'s long-lived orca clans and the\\nmatriarchs who led them. she knew she would find them in fife sound\\nat the ebb tide, or moving up johnson strait with the incoming\\ntide. using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone she hung from\\nthe boat, she recorded their vocalizations and began to recognize\\nwhat she called the dialects of the clans.\\n\\nher husband drowned in 1986, when jarret was 4, but morton\\nstayed on, supporting her work by writing articles and books,\\ndesigning t-shirts and working as a deckhand on a fishing boat.\\n\\ntoday, she hardly uses her hydrophone. there\\'s no point, she\\nsays, \"since my subject is so rare now.\" these days, when morton\\nnoses her workboat away from her dock here, she is on a crusade,\\nseeking not orcas, but evidence against the salmon farms she\\nbelieves drove most of the killer whales away, in part by infecting\\nthe wild salmon the whales eat with parasites called sea lice. her\\nwork is a challenge to the salmon farm industry and to the canadian\\nand british columbia officials who regulate it.\\n\\nonce dismissed as an outsider and amateur, morton has gradually\\ngained the respect of fisheries experts like ray hilborn, a\\nresearcher at the university of washington. \"she doesn\\'t come from\\na science background but she has had a lot of influence in\\nhighlighting the issue,\" he said. daniel pauly, director of the\\nfisheries center at the university of british columbia, calls her\\n\"a spunky hero.\"\\n\\nthat may be because she takes the issue personally. the\\ndisappearance of the orcas in the broughton \"ruined my life,\\nabsolutely,\" morton said one day recently as she headed off to net\\nbaby salmon and check them for sea lice. \"a lot of people have\\nlost stuff they set out to do but, yeah, it ruined my whole plan.\"\\n\\naccording to the british columbia salmon farmers association,\\nsalmon farms produce $450 million worth of atlantic salmon a year\\nin british columbia. at any given time, 70 to 80 farm sites operate\\nin provincial waters, perhaps 15 or so in the broughton, a hardly\\ninhabited area across queen charlotte strait from the north end of\\nvancouver island. typically, each installation has a collection of\\nnet pens, usually crossed by metal walkways, floating in a cove or\\nbay. individual sites typically contain 500,000 to 750,000 penned\\nfish.\\n\\nas tiny young wild salmon, smolts, pass by these pens on their\\nway to sea, they can pick up so many lice they die, morton and\\nother researchers have reported.\\n\\nfarm operators like marine harvest, a norwegian concern that is\\na major presence in salmon farming here, concede that penned fish\\nare vulnerable to microbes and parasites but say drugs and\\npesticides minimize the problem, virtually eliminating the risk to\\nwild fish stocks.\\n\\nfor example, kelly osborne, who manages farm sites in the\\nbroughton for marine harvest, said penned fish were treated with an\\nantilouse drug called slice as smolts began their migration to the\\nocean. the drug is so effective, he said, that perhaps only 1 in 10\\npenned fish would have a live louse.\\n\\ngovernment officials say it would be premature to blame the\\nfarms for declines in salmon runs seen here recently because those\\nnumbers fluctuate naturally.\\n\\nbut morton and researchers like martin krkosek of the university\\nof alberta and john volpe of the university of victoria predict\\nthat some local salmon runs will disappear unless the farms are\\naltered or removed. and because salmon loom large in the diets of\\norcas, bears, eagles and other animals, their disappearance would\\nunravel the region\\'s web of life.\\n\\n\"a lot of wild salmon populations have been on the edge for\\nquite a long time,\" threatened by logging, dams and \"plain old\\noverfishing,\" said ellen pikitch, a fisheries biologist who heads\\nthe institute for ocean conservation science at stony brook\\nuniversity in new york. \"the sea lice problem could be the nail in\\nthe coffin for some of these fish.\"\\n\\n(pikitch also pointed out what some scientists say is an even\\nbigger problem with salmon farms. it takes more than one pound of\\nfish, processed into pellets, to produce one pound of salmon. even\\nthough farms are working to bring the ration down -- some say they\\nhave achieved a one-to-one ratio -- pikitch said the growing need to\\nfeed farmed salmon had greatly increased the demand for anchovies,\\nherring and other fish, and \"aquaculture is indirectly pulling the\\nrug out from under the ocean ecosystem.\")\\n\\nwhen morton arrived at the broughton, she was a graceful young\\nwoman with dark hair that flowed halfway down her back. \"i thought\\nshe was another crazy hippie,\" billy proctor, locally acknowledged\\nas the broughton\\'s master fisherman, said in an interview.\\n\\nshe still moves gracefully but her flowing hair is gray now. and\\nshe long ago won proctor\\'s admiration for her devotion to the\\nbroughton and its wildlife. when her husband died, proctor took\\nmorton on as a deckhand. they collaborated on a book, \"heart of\\nthe raincoast\" (touchwood editions, 1998), an account of his life\\nand changing times.\\n\\ntoday, when proctor and other fishermen find escaped atlantic\\nsalmon in their nets, they often bring them to her. she cuts them\\nopen and records, among other things, whether they have been fed\\nthe chemicals that farms add to feed to color their grayish flesh a\\nmore appealing pink. then she disposes of the bodies, usually by\\ndumping them in the water for crabs and other scavengers to eat.\\n\\nmeanwhile, in what she calls \"partnered science,\" she works\\nregularly with experts from several universities. typically, they\\ndesign a research plan and morton organizes the collection of field\\nsamples and other data to help carry it out.\\n\\nat first, morton reported her observations \"naively,\" pauly\\nrecalled. \"it was simply \\'hey, look at this, wild salmon are\\nriddled with parasites.\"\\' her opponents attacked her as\\ninadequately credentialed, he said.\\n\\nin the years since, papers morton has helped write have appeared\\nin major scientific journals like science, which in december\\npublished a study in which she and her coauthors link fish farms to\\nprecipitous declines of pink salmon in the broughton.\\n\\nscientists at the university of alberta, simon fraser university\\nand the university of victoria are sending graduate students to the\\nsalmon coast research station she established here at echo bay, a\\ncommunity of a few families that clings to rocky crags that plunge,\\nbeachless, straight down into cold, clear water.\\n\\nthere is so little flat land that many people live in float\\nhouses -- cabins built on rafts or \"floats\" of foot-thick logs\\nlashed to the shore. there are no roads, no cars and no shops\\nexcept the few shelves of staples in the post office in simoom\\nsound, around a wooded promontory from morton\\'s home, where mail\\narrives once a week.\\n\\nmorton acknowledges that \"the three ws: widow, whales,\\nwilderness\" draw a lot of attention to her work. she embraces it.\\n\"the problem with this whole issue is if nobody sees it nothing\\nhappens,\" she said one day recently as she motored past one of the\\nfarming operations. and because most of the fish farmed here end up\\nin trucks heading down i-5 to california, she said, \"it can\\'t just\\nbe the canadian public. it has to be the american public.\"\\n\\nso just as jane goodall speaks for chimps, morton said, she\\nwants to tell the world about the troubles afflicting the orcas,\\nnot as a crusader, but as \"a woman cleaning house.\"\\n\\nthe research station occupies a shedlike building on a float.\\nthe graduate students and other researchers live in a cluster of\\nhouses, their wooden walls untouched by paper or paint, perched on\\nthe rock slope inland. one is a former float house that proctor\\nlived in as a boy and which morton and her son occupied after\\nproctor and other neighbors hauled it up onto the rocks, a\\ndisaster-filled episode she recounts in her autobiography,\\n\"listening to whales\" (ballantine books, 2002). jarret, who\\ngraduated from the university of british columbia, works as an\\nengineer in utah now, morton said.\\n\\nanother is a house she built with eric nelson, whom she met\\nseveral years after her husband died and who is the father of her\\n12-year-old daughter, clio. still another is a house she built\\nherself, she said, when it was clear the couple would split up.\\n\\nthe station is supported in part by sarah haney, a retired nurse\\nand environmental campaigner from ontario whose philanthropic\\nresources come from the game trivial pursuit -- her former husband\\nwas one of its inventors and she was an early partner in the\\nventure. one of her major interests is whales, haney said in a\\ntelephone interview, so she learned about morton and her work. when\\nthe compound came up for sale, haney bought it and paid \"a lot of\\nmoney\" for improvements including a new dock, and a laboratory\\nbuilding.\\n\\nthis summer, she deeded the whole place over to

1987\\nmasterwork, \"beloved\": a runaway slave, caught in her effort to\\nescape, cuts the throat of her baby daughter with a handsaw,\\ndetermined to spare the girl the fate she herself has suffered as a\\nslave. a similarly indelible act stands at the center of morrison\\'s\\nremarkable new novella, \"a mercy,\" a small, plangent gem of a\\nstory that is, at once, a kind of prelude to \"beloved\" and a\\nvariation on that earlier book\\'s exploration of the personal costs\\nof slavery -- a system that moves men and women and children around\\n\"like checkers\" and casts a looming shadow over both parental and\\nromantic love.\\n\\nset some 200 years before \"beloved,\" \"a mercy\" conjures up\\nthe beautiful, untamed, lawless world that was america in the 17th\\ncentury with the same sort of lyrical, verdant prose that\\ndistinguished that earlier novel. gone are the didactic language\\nand schematic architecture that hobbled the author\\'s 1998 novel,\\n\"paradise\"; gone are the cartoonish characters that marred her\\n2003 novel, \"love.\" instead morrison has rediscovered an urgent,\\npoetic voice that enables her to move back and forth with immediacy\\nand ease between the worlds of history and myth, between ordinary\\ndaily life and the realm of fable.\\n\\nall the central characters in this story are orphans, cast off\\nby their parents or swept away from their families by acts of god\\nor nature or human cruelty -- literal or figurative exiles\\nsusceptible to the centrifugal forces of history. there is jacob,\\nan anglo-dutch trader, whose memories of his own parentless years\\non the streets \"stealing food and cadging gratuities for errands\"\\nhave left him with a \"pulse of pity for orphans and strays.\"\\nthere is his wife, rebekka, who as a girl of 16 was sent abroad to\\namerica by her father, who, happy to have one less mouth to feed,\\nreadily accepted jacob\\'s offer of \"\\'reimbursement\\' for clothing,\\nexpenses and a few supplies\" in exchange for a \"healthy, chaste\\nwife willing to travel abroad.\" and there is florens, whose mother\\nsees the kindness in jacob\\'s heart and begs him to take her young\\ndaughter (as payment for a debt owed by their domineering owner) in\\nthe hopes that the trader will give her a better life and the\\npossibility of a future as a free woman, not a slave.\\n\\nbut what is \"a mercy\" to florens\\' mother is experienced by the\\ngirl as an act of abandonment, and it will leave her with a hole in\\nher heart and an abiding need for love and approval. for a time,\\nflorens finds a sense of belonging on jacob\\'s farm -- the illusion,\\neven, of family. jacob is often away from home doing business, and\\nrebekka and lina, the american indian slave who helped jacob get\\nthe farm started, find the daily hardships of frontier life\\nbringing them together in an alliance of survival that slowly turns\\ninto friendship.\\n\\nboth are wary of the first waif jacob brings home: a strange,\\ndaft girl named sorrow, who was found half-drowned in a river.\\nrebekka regards sorrow as useless around the farm, while lina, who\\nhas survived the devastation of her own tribe by a plague, sees the\\nstranger as \"bad luck in the flesh\" and blames her for the early\\ndeaths of rebekka\\'s children.\\n\\nflorens, in contrast, awakens a maternal instinct in lina, and\\nshe embraces the girl as if she were long-lost kin: \"a frightened,\\nlong-necked child who did not speak for weeks but when she did, her\\nlight, singsong voice was lovely to hear. some how, some way, the\\nchild assuaged the tiny yet eternal yearning for the home lina once\\nknew, where everyone had anything, and no one had everything.\"\\n\\nyears later florens falls passionately in love with a visiting\\nblacksmith, a free black man who has come to work on a fancy gate\\nfor jacob\\'s new house, and who miraculously cures sorrow of a\\ndeathly illness. lina warns her of the perils of giving away her\\nheart -- \"you are one leaf on his tree,\" she says -- but florens\\ninsists she is \"his tree.\"\\n\\nwhen his work is done, however, the blacksmith leaves without\\neven troubling to say goodbye, and like so many earlier morrison\\ncharacters, florens learns the perils of caring too much -- and the\\nlegacy of loss and leaving bequeathed to her by her mother.\\n\\nas long as jacob is alive, morrison writes, \"it was easy to\\nveil the truth: that they were not a family -- not even a\\nlike-minded group.\" but when he suddenly dies of the pox, and\\nrebekka, too, falls gravely ill, lina, florens and sorrow realize\\ntheir precarious position.\\n\\n\"three unmastered women,\" alone, \"belonging to no one, became\\nwild game for anyone\": \"female and illegal, they would be\\ninterlopers, squatters, if they stayed on after mistress died,\\nsubject to purchase, hire, assault, abduction, exile.\" their one\\nhope is to find the blacksmith and persuade him to return to work\\nhis magic on rebekka. it is florens who is sent on this quest, her\\npassion for the man both a spur and a hazard to her mission.\\n\\nthe main storyteller in this volume is florens, who, abandoned\\nby the blacksmith, feels herself \"an ice floe cut away from the\\nriverbank.\" but her voice is just one in this choral tale -- a tale\\nthat not only emerges as a heartbreaking account of lost innocence\\nand fractured dreams, but also stands, with \"beloved,\" as one of\\nmorrison\\'s most haunting works yet.\\n\\npublication notes\\n\\n\\'a mercy\\'\\n\\nby toni morrison\\n\\n167 pages. alfred a. knopf. $23.95.\\n\\nthis city once dreamed in lofty superlatives --\\nthat it could become a major metropolis, axis of the intermountain\\nwest and heavyweight hub of the high plains.\\n\\nbut by the late 1800s, denver, 100 miles south in colorado, had\\nwon the contest. gold strikes and good water supplies made the\\ndifference. cheyenne gradually retreated to its roots as a\\nwind-blown provincial town, dependent on a cold war-era missile\\nbase and on wyoming\\'s tiny state government for jobs.\\n\\nnow the denver area\\'s relentless growth, with its satellite\\ncities and suburbs that march north toward wyoming, is grabbing\\ncheyenne by the lapels.\\n\\nbut maps are political documents, too, and the poll numbers\\nsuggest that the same newcomers who have reshaped the denver\\nmetropolitan economy may now be leading colorado, once-dependably\\nrepublican, into the democratic column by supporting sen. barack\\nobama for president. obama is comfortably ahead in most polls in\\ncolorado going into tuesday\\'s election. wyoming, by contrast, with\\njust over 500,000 people, less than one-tenth of colorado\\'s\\npopulation, is among the most stalwart of republican states and\\nshows little sign of budging.\\n\\nthe result is not exactly a collision, but rather a kind of\\naccordion affect, like the two-headed pushmi-pullyu from the dr.\\ndolittle stories. one force is pulling the two states closer as the\\njuggernaut of urbanization shifts the economic and demographic\\nlandscape; the other is carving out a deeper separation as most of\\nwyoming holds firm to its cowboy, go-it-alone ethos.\\n\\nchange for old cheyenne, population 55,000, is the one\\ncertainty.\\n\\nwyoming\\'s low-rise capital city has long been isolated by virtue\\nof its founding as a railroad town; it was plunked in the state\\'s\\nsoutheast corner not for loveliness or riches but because it was\\nmidway between the union pacific\\'s other major depots of the 1860s,\\nin omaha and ogden, utah. now, it is braced for impact.\\n\\nabout 16,000 passenger vehicles cross the border everyday, at\\nleast 2,200 of them commuters to jobs on one side of the border or\\nthe other, according to wyoming state figures. the wyoming\\nlegislature, where \"mass transit\" is seldom heard, took testimony\\nin october from a state consultant who recommended that the state\\nstart conferring with planners in denver who are hoping to build a\\ncommuter rail line of 300 miles or more from wyoming to new mexico.\\n\\n\"economics is what we are really after,\" said state sen.\\nmichael von flatern, a republican and co-chairman of the\\ntransportation, highways and military affairs committee. \"denver\\nwill be a big megalopolis, and if things move forward on the rail\\nline, and colorado does their part, i would want wyoming to tie\\nin.\"\\n\\npeople like john brazzale, a 47-year-old electrician from\\ncheyenne who has worked here and in denver, say they think the knot\\nhas already been tied. now it is time for the honeymoon.\\n\\n\"something\\'s coming,\" brazzale said as he rewired lampposts\\noutside the union pacific depot on a recent morning -- old-fashioned\\nbulbs out, energy-efficient fluorescent lights in. \"just look at\\nthe hotels that are going up around here. they\\'re not building them\\nfor fun.\"\\n\\nbrazzale, who described himself as a union man and a democrat,\\nsaid that he welcomed the change, and that, who knows, in 20 years,\\ncheyenne could even become a kind of high-tech wunderkind like\\nboulder, a denver satellite known for its fancy restaurants,\\nliberals and geeks.\\n\\nin a hint of that possible future, the national center for\\natmospheric research in boulder, a climate research institute\\nfinanced by the national science foundation, announced last year\\nthat its next-generation supercomputer center would be built in\\ncheyenne. scheduled to open in 2011, the center will foster\\ninteraction between researchers from colorado and wyoming who will\\nnow have reason to meet in cheyenne.\\n\\nstill, ron willis is among those who think the old political\\nboundaries will hold, even as things change.\\n\\n\"colorado is becoming a more democratic state, but wyoming will\\nremain republican,\" said willis, 32, who runs a state-federal\\nprogram to help residents weatherize their homes to conserve\\nenergy. \"i think the two states will remain separated.\"\\n\\npolitics aside, willis said wyoming still held a monopoly on\\nreal western culture and would not surrender the claim to denver,\\nregardless of dollar signs.\\n\\n\"denver has never really been the west,\" he said, repeating a\\ncommonly heard insult around here that, in rowdier days, might have\\nsparked a fistfight.\\n\\nat the cheyenne area convention and visitors bureau, the group\\'s\\npresident and chief executive, darren rudloff, said he thought a\\ngreater linkage with denver was inevitable and mostly positive.\\n\\nthe three conjoined metropolitan areas of northeastern colorado\\n-- denver-aurora, boulder and fort collins-loveland -- now press\\nright up to the wyoming border. taken together, they are among the\\nfastest-growing areas in the nation over the last two decades, with\\na population increase of about 44 percent, to just under 3 million\\npeople, according to the most recent census bureau estimates.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think there\\'s any business resistance,\" rudloff said.\\n\"but there would be, i think, in some quarters, resistance to\\nlosing too much of the cheyenneness -- there would be some push\\nback.\"\\n\\non the other hand, rudloff added, many wyoming residents have\\nalready written off cheyenne, believing that the city has fallen\\noff the map already and into colorado.\\n\\n\"we\\'re not colorado and we\\'re not totally wyoming, according to\\nsome people,\" he said. \"so we\\'re kind of stuck in the middle.\"\\n\\nbut if geography is destiny, there is perhaps a historical twist\\nas well. political and business leaders here say the growth of\\nmetropolitan denver\\'s population north toward wyoming, which has no\\nincome tax, sharpens the business allure of cheyenne as a commuting\\ndestination for more and more coloradans, making the city a\\nlegitimate contender with denver for the first time in generations\\nand stirring those old dreams of greatness.\\n\\nlaura adams, an accountant with the state government, said she\\nwelcomed the new economic connections. \"it can only help\\ncheyenne,\" adams said. \"a lot of people still don\\'t even know\\nwhere it is.\"\\n\\nbut do not get her started on politics.\\n\\nadams, 51, who described herself as a strong supporter of sen.\\njohn mccain, the republican presidential nominee, is unhappy with\\ncolorado\\'s political direction and with the denver news media,\\nwhich often serve cheyenne as an afterthought. after the democrats\\nheld their national convention in denver in august, adams said, too\\nmany locals fell in love with the party.\\n\\n\"i listen to a radio station that comes from denver,\" she\\nsaid. \"i had to turn it off. i couldn\\'t stand it any more.\"\\n\\ni voted a week ago in order to write this column. it is intended to\\nbe a\\nuseful guide. i assume you will clip this article out of

crank\\nwho would vote to eliminate the income tax. it was tempting,\\nespecially\\nconsidering who was arrayed against it: every featherbedding,\\nethically\\ncompromised labor union in the state, hand in hand with the\\nself-appointed\\n\"good government\" types. voting \"yes\" seemed like a brief,\\npleasurable,\\nbut ultimately pointless gesture, like yelling at manny ramirez on\\nthe tv\\nset. i have lots of enemies, but the state of massachusetts isn\\'t\\none of\\nthem. i voted no.\\n\\nquestion 2: sure, croesus-level currency manipulator and\\nquestion two\\nbacker george soros, i\\'ll give you my vote. not bloody likely!\\ndoper\\npolitics don\\'t fascinate me, but i\\'ll vote against soros any time.\\ni voted\\nno.\\n\\nquestion 3: i voted no, again. isn\\'t the idea of banning dog\\nracing just\\nclassist pap? why not ban thoroughbred horse racing, with its\\ncreepy\\nlysenkoist breeding ideologies and its pitiless jettisoning of\\nbeautiful\\nhorses past their primes? oh, that\\'s right. because posh people\\napprove of\\nhorse racing, and because institutions that matter, such as the\\nstate of\\nnew york (otb) or abc and espn (the breeder\\'s cup) make serious\\nmoney off\\nhorse racing.\\n\\nno one makes serious money off the dogs, not even the track\\nowners, if\\ntheir baying is to be believed. don\\'t push your peta politics on\\nme.\\n\\nthe presidency: some background: i hate voting for national\\noffices here,\\nbecause massachusetts is a one-party state. i would happily go into\\ngrade\\nschools and urge children not to vote until pulling the lever here\\nactually\\nmeans something. somehow i don\\'t think the league of women voters\\nis going\\nto take me up on this offer.\\n\\neight years ago, i voted for ralph nader and am proud that i\\ndid. four\\nyears ago, i sold my vote to my then 17-year-old son, who wished he\\nhad\\nbeen able to vote for kerry. i voted for kerry on his behalf, and\\nhe agreed\\nto walk the dog.

on\\nseven counts\\nof corruption, could be the protagonist of an arthur miller\\ntragedy: a\\nformerly robust, confident american winner laid low by secret\\ncompromises\\nand long-repressed deceits. and tuesday could be his denouement.\\n\\nhaving refused to drop out of his race for reelection - despite\\nrequests\\nfrom fellow republicans john mccain and his home-state governor,\\nsarah\\npalin - stevens could well end his career in electoral defeat, to\\ngo along\\nwith his criminal convictions.\\n\\nit\\'s a mighty fall for a man known as alaska\\'s patriarch, a\\nformer world\\nwar ii pilot who went on to play a role in his state\\'s battle to\\njoin the\\nunion, and then represented it in the senate for 40 years.\\n\\nin washington, he will be remembered mostly as a pork-barrel\\npolitician,\\ndelivering billions of dollars in earmarks to his constituents\\nwhile\\nstinting a bit on the larger national issues of the day. but in his\\nhome\\nstate, the man was a giant, and his disgrace commands a measure of\\nsympathy.\\n\\nthe elderly senator sat ramrod straight in the washington\\ncourtroom as the\\njury delivered its verdict. news reports say he tried to knit his\\nfingers,\\nin a gesture of calmness, but had to give up because one of his\\nhands was\\nshaking so badly.\\n\\ndespite the convictions, some of his loyal constituents - who\\nmay yet\\nreturn him to the senate - find the charges against him to be\\ninsubstantial.\\n\\nthere was little dispute that stevens received hundreds of\\nthousands of\\ndollars of renovations to his alaskan cabin, paid for by bill\\nallen, ceo of\\na now-defunct oil-services company called veco, which had extensive\\nbusiness on alaska\\'s north slope. stevens failed to mention the\\nhome\\nrenovations and other gifts from allen - including a gas grill and\\na sled\\ndog - on senate ethics forms for seven consecutive years.\\n\\nbut he contended that he was unaware of some of the gifts and\\nthought he\\nhad paid for others. therefore, he believed the forms were accurate\\nwhen he\\nsigned them. and his wife catherine asserted that she alone had\\noverseen\\nthe renovations. (workers, however, testified that stevens was\\npresent for\\nsome of the work. plus, the stevenses didn\\'t even have contracts\\nwith some\\nof the renovators - allen arranged everything.)\\n\\nlastly, stevens\\'s defenders have noted that he and allen were\\nfriends,\\nsuggesting that the gifts were more tokens of affection than\\nbribery. and\\nit\\'s clear that stevens, like many politicians before him, finds it\\nlaughable that prosecutors would feel such gifts could corrupt his\\nintegrity: he would behave the same way in his official capacity\\nwhether\\nallen gave him a $6,000 mega-grill or a puppy.\\n\\nbut his case - starting with the longstanding allegiance between\\na\\npolitician and a businessman, morphing into a \"friendship,\"\\nleading to\\npampering and gifts - is practically a prototype of official\\nwashington\\ncorruption.\\n\\nthe purpose of ethics laws is not to guard against the unjust\\nenrichment\\nof senators so much as to protect the public coffers from being\\nused to\\nservice the kinds of friendships that existed between stevens and\\nallen.\\nthe sad reality is that such relative trifles as gas grills, hot\\ntubs, and\\nfree rides on corporate jets can create a back-scratch relationship\\nthat\\nleads to the giveaway of hundreds of times their value in public\\nlargesse.\\n\\nthe one sacrifice made by career politicians like stevens is to\\nlive with\\na salary of $169,000 per year. it\\'s not so tough. but for men and\\nwomen who\\ncontrol billions of dollars, it is often galling to see\\nless-powerful\\npeople enjoying more luxurious lives. and when those businesspeople\\nare\\neager to cultivate relationships, it\\'s easy for politicians -\\nparticularly\\nthose without rich spouses or family fortunes to fall back on - to\\nstart\\naccepting a favor here and there.\\n\\nwhether those little favors lead, in return, to bigger ones in\\nthe form of\\ngovernment contracts can be difficult to prove in any specific\\ninstance.\\nbut the idea that such tacit exchanges happen fairly frequently,\\nand often\\nunder the radar, is ridiculously easy to comprehend. so the senate\\nwisely\\nrequires disclosures of the type that stevens failed to make.\\n\\nit seems like a long fall from being mr. alaska to mr. pork\\nbarrel to mr.\\nfelon, but it may not be such a great distance after all.\\n\\npeter s. canellos is the globe\\'s washington bureau chief.\\nnational\\nperspective is his weekly analysis of events in the capital and\\nbeyond. he\\ncan be reached at canellos@globe.com\\n\\neds: with \\'hair-side\\'\\n\\nevery time palos verdes peninsula resident kate mclaughlin gets\\nher hair done, her husband has a fit. the way he sees it -- why\\nwaste a couple hundred bucks on a haircut when the economy is down\\nand millions of americans are struggling to make ends meet?\\n\\nbut ask mclaughlin, and she\\'ll tell you flat-out: hair is\\nnon-negotiable.\\n\\n\"you just grin and pay for it like you do your school loan,\\nmortgage payment and vehicle repair bill,\" said mclaughlin, a\\nformer newspaper reporter and now a college journalism instructor.\\n\"hair is a top spending priority in any economy.\"\\n\\nbut it is expensive.\\n\\nat most high-end salons in los angeles, a cut and color can cost\\nbetween $200 and $500. even at budget-\\n\\nconscious spots such as supercuts, highlighting services start\\nat $75 (add on their $16 haircuts and you\\'re looking at a nearly\\n$100 service, minimum).\\n\\nit adds up. according to a british survey conducted by\\n\\nthe hair product company\\n\\ntresemme, the average woman spends about $50,000 on her hair in\\nher lifetime. that\\'s a figure that includes about $160 annually on\\nshampoos and conditioners, $120 for home styling products and $520\\nfor haircuts -- plus $330 more per year for those who use color.\\n\\n\"there are a thousand other places we can economize -- food,\\nbooze, trips, travel, fuel consumption, clothes, accessories,\\nstarbucks, nails,\" mclaughlin said. \"anyone who is skimping on\\nthe locks, in my humble opinion, has her priorities wrong.\"\\n\\nmost women agree. at least according to debi dumas, chief\\ncolorist at the jim wayne salon in beverly hills, who said she\\nhasn\\'t seen a big change in business -- even with the sputtering\\neconomy.\\n\\n\"you get a lot for what you\\'re spending,\" said dumas, who has\\ntended the tresses of celebrities including sharon stone, candace\\ncameron bure and mischa barton. \"if you go to buy a new outfit,\\nyou feel good in it the first time you wear it. ... but after\\nyou\\'ve worn it one or two times, you don\\'t feel as special in it.\\n\\n\"when you get your hair done, you\\'re going to get four months\\nout of it.\"\\n\\nmelissa heckscher (310) 540-5511,\\n\\next. 329;

(remember, in 2004 exit polls showed democrat john kerry in\\nthe lead. digest them with caution.)\\n\\n-- 8:30 p.m.\\n\\nthe polls have closed in 17 more states and 275 electoral votes\\nare now on the table.\\n\\nmccain probably needs to hold on to two of three states -- ohio,\\npennsylvania and florida -- in order to win. ohio polls came in an\\nhour earlier, so look to the other two states now to see where they\\nare leaning.\\n\\nif mccain wins two or all three (and in that instance, obama has\\npicked up another state such as virginia) all eyes turn to the\\nwest. also watch missouri. it\\'s a swing state and may give you a\\npreview for results from upcoming states.\\n\\n(if the networks, cable news and papers online try to call the\\nrace at this point, remember \"al gore wins florida\" and \"dewey\\ndefeats truman.\")\\n\\n-- 9 - 10 p.m.\\n\\nwith a total of 451 electoral votes now up for grabs, this is\\nlikely the make-or-break hour. and the rocky mountain west is front\\nand center. if obama so far has only picked up states john kerry\\nwon four years ago, a sweep of colorado, new mexico and nevada\\nwould be the tipping point. (there is no need to wait for\\ncalifornia, washington and oregon, whose polls close at 11 p.m.,\\nbecause they historically go democratic).\\n\\nif mccain has followed in bush\\'s footsteps, he just needs one of\\nthose three states to win. if he\\'s lost a state like iowa, then he\\nwould need two of them.\\n\\nif mccain has won the interior south and most of the rust belt,\\nand obama has picked up iowa and a southern state like virginia,\\nthe battle heads straight to colorado and nevada (assuming new\\nmexico goes for obama). the 14 electoral votes would put either\\ncandidate into

fifth\\nseason, with\\ntoo many regular characters who have nothing to do. between dr.\\nhouse\\'s old\\nstaff, his new staff, his private detective, doctors wilson and\\ncuddy, and\\nthe patients-of-the-week, the fox show has become something of a\\ntraffic\\njam. when the \"house\" writers finally devote an episode to the\\nonce-prominent cameron-chase romance next tuesday, it will feel\\nlike\\nnostalgia night.\\n\\ni was also going to say that the \"house\" storylines have grown\\nincreasingly preposterous over the years - and they were cuckoo to\\nstart\\nwith. sometimes, the medical mysteries and the dramas about the\\ndoctors\\'\\npersonal lives are so over-the-top, i have to go into a kind of\\ndenial to\\nget through the hour. i have to work to suspend my wild disbelief\\nwhile i\\'m\\nwatching the insanity unfold - doctors breaking into patients\\'\\nhomes, house\\nhaving his p.i. go through wilson\\'s garbage, thirteen getting fired\\nbut not\\nleaving. but then later on, or during the commercials, i shake my\\nhead and\\nlaugh at the lunacy. ok, cuddy just drugged house so that wilson\\ncould\\nkidnap him and drive him to his father\\'s funeral. got it.\\n\\nand yet i would much rather say something completely different\\nhere.\\n\\nagainst all odds, and against all the evidence of sloppy\\nstorytelling and\\nexcessive implausibility, \"house\" remains one of network tv\\'s\\nmost\\ndynamic hours. obviously, hugh laurie is outrageously good; he has\\ncreated\\nan awful, brilliant, condescending, needy, childlike, curmudgeonly\\ncharacter with nary a wrong note over five years. his house already\\ndeserves a spot in the tv character hall of fame, near archie\\nbunker and\\nhawkeye pierce.\\n\\nbut i do find that, despite the occasional bum episode, the\\ndrama that is\\nbuilt around laurie is still good, too. weird, but good. \"house\"\\ncan\\'t be\\napproached and judged as a typical medical procedural, even while\\nit has\\nthat formulaic quality. the show needs to be viewed as a comic\\npsychodrama\\nin which all the medical cases reflect aspects of the doctors, and\\nall the\\ndoctors reflect aspects of house, and house reflects the naked id.\\nit\\'s a\\ncrazy \"house\" of mirrors. the crowded cast, the overheated\\naction, and\\nall the absurd twists and turns are the show\\'s unique stylization.\\n\"house\" may be mainstream tv\\'s boldest-ever psychological farce.\\n\\nyes, i have sometimes joined in the chorus of fans who feel that\\n\"house\"\\nis over. but right here, right now, i\\'m feeling more optimistic.\\nwith\\nolivia wilde\\'s thirteen getting more compelling, and house and\\ncuddy\\ngetting romantic, and bold direction that can turn a prime-time\\nhour into a\\ndreamlike fantasia, the show still deserves a chance.\\n\\nmatthew gilbert can be reached at gilbert@globe.com. for more\\non tv,\\nvisit boston.com/ ae/tv/blog/.\\n\\nwashington - pennsylvania republicans and an independent

them could have expected this kind of\\nresponsibility; lambright himself was a last-minute substitute\\nafter a previous appointee was kept in his old job.\\n\\non friday evening, lambright was lugging a six-inch-thick pile\\nof folders -- plus a pair of blackberrys and a cellphone -- as he\\nprepared for a sunday afternoon meeting of the committee to select\\nthe next banks to receive capital infusions.\\n\\nwith more than $80 billion left to spend, and hundreds of banks\\nin line for it, the days, nights and weekends of the overworked,\\nsleep-deprived treasury staff members are a blur of meetings and\\nconference calls, and constant pressure.\\n\\n\"this is a four-ring circus,\" said tim ryan, a former director\\nof the office of thrift supervision, who helped run the savings and\\nloan cleanup in the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\nalready, critics from capitol hill to wall street are lashing\\nout at the program, saying the banks are misusing the capital\\ninfusions by hoarding the money rather than lending it, as the\\ntreasury secretary, henry m. paulson jr., urged in order to unclog\\nthe credit markets.\\n\\nthe government, the critics say, is wrongly steering funds to\\nbanks to take over weaker rivals. the rescue program prodded one\\nsuch merger last week, when treasury agreed to inject $7.7 billion\\ninto pnc financial services and rejected an application for cash\\nfrom national city corp., an ailing bank in cleveland. the two\\nannounced a merger the same day that pnc was approved.\\n\\n\"where we are headed is credit allocation by the federal\\ngovernment,\" said william poole, a former president of the federal\\nreserve bank of st. louis. \"it really reminds me of the morass we\\ngot into with wage-price controls in the 1970s.\"\\n\\ncritics also say that, by not barring banks from paying\\ndividends or hefty bonuses, the treasury is leading taxpayers to\\nthink their money is being spent frivolously.\\n\\nall this comes after paulson abruptly shifted the focus of the\\nprogram to injecting capital rather than buying distressed\\nmortgage-related assets from the banks. this meant that congress\\nhad never debated the details of how the government ought to carry\\nout a recapitalization.\\n\\nthe absence of that debate comes with a price. treasury\\nofficials have been pressured by industry lobbyists to stretch the\\nprogram to include insurance companies, transit agencies and even\\nautomakers.\\n\\nindeed, the helter-skelter nature of the program is drawing so\\nmuch criticism that even some of the bailout bill\\'s biggest\\nproponents on capitol hill are complaining that its legitimacy is\\nbeing thrown into question. \"what the treasury doesn\\'t understand\\nis the anger in the country about this,\" said rep. barney frank,\\nd-mass., the chairman of the house financial services committee.\\n\\nfrank, who has scheduled oversight hearings later in november,\\nwarned that he might try to block the treasury from getting the\\nsecond $350 billion approved by congress.\\n\\ninside the treasury -- where officials shuttle between each\\nother\\'s offices on the building\\'s southwest corner, facing the\\nwhite house and the washington monument -- the view, not\\nsurprisingly, is different.\\n\\n\"they say the critics have not offered solutions about how to\\ncompel banks to lend money. the treasury has to walk a fine line,\\nofficials add, since using brute force could lead to the banks\\nmaking more bad loans, which is how they got into this mess.\\n\\ntreasury officials acknowledge their actions might speed a\\nshakeout in the industry, even if that is not the main motivation.\\n\\n\"the primary goal is not consolidation; the primary goal is to\\nstrengthen the system,\" said michele a. davis, the chief\\nspokeswoman. \"if consolidation strengthens the system, it\\'s a\\npositive.\"\\n\\nbank executives say that increased lending depends on attracting\\nmore capital from private investors. to do that, it may be\\nessential for a bank to strengthen its market position by making\\nacquisitions. suspending dividends could send investors running for\\nthe exits.\\n\\nbesides, they add, the bailout law only allows the government to\\nstop banks from increasing dividends, not banning them outright.\\n\\nthe committee -- which also includes neel kashkari, interim head\\nof the rescue program, and two other assistant secretaries, anthony\\nryan and phillip l. swagel -- acts on a recommendation from the\\nprimary regulator of the financial institution. that could be the\\nfederal reserve, the federal deposit insurance corp., the\\ncomptroller of the currency or the office of thrift supervision.\\n\\nwhat happens next, when the application and recommendation go to\\nthe treasury, is largely a mystery. the criteria by which the\\ntreasury decides which banks get money and which do not are secret.\\n\\nnason said the process had to be confidential so that rejected\\nbanks did not suffer damage in the markets. even to disclose the\\nselection criteria could quickly destabilize banks perceived to\\nhave the wrong profile, he said.\\n\\nthe committee members study financial statements and sometimes\\nkick back applications to the regulators for more information. they\\nalso analyze the market in which a bank operates, looking for the\\nmix of strong and weak banks. as the number of applications\\nincreases, lambright said he was recruiting a team of banking\\nanalysts to help with the process.\\n\\n\"when we move from a dozen banks to hundreds of banks, we\\'ll\\nneed a system,\" lambright said.\\n\\nhe said his work at the export-import bank, where he selected\\namerican exporters to receive trade financing, was good preparation\\nfor this job, even if he will hand out more money in a few weeks at\\nthe treasury than his bank\\'s entire $60 billion credit portfolio.\\n\\nthough treasury officials are loath to require banks to lend,\\nthey do seem to be jawboning. \"they must meet their responsibility\\nto lend, and support the american people and the u.s. economy,\"\\nryan told a securities industry conference last week.\\n\\nfrank said they should do more by requiring banks to show a\\ndollar-for-dollar relationship between the government funds and\\nincreased lending.\\n\\n\"if they lend out all the money they got from the government,\"\\nhe said, \"they can do whatever they want with the rest. if they\\ndon\\'t feel this is going to encourage lending, then don\\'t take the\\nmoney.\"\\n\\nit is the regulators, more than the treasury department, who are\\ndoing the coaxing by suggesting, for example, that a desired merger\\nby a bank would be more likely to win approval if a bank\\nparticipated in the capital injection program, industry executives\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe treasury\\'s approach has its defenders, among them a former\\nsenior treasury official, edwin m. truman, who said he believed the\\npeople running the bailout were technocrats trying to shore up the\\nsystem, not ideologues.\\n\\ndonald v. hammond, a longtime treasury official who is the\\ninterim chief compliance officer of the program, said that, in any\\nevent, congress had put in place layers of oversight. hammond began\\nhis government career working on the bailout of the chrysler corp.\\n\\n\"this is more intense,\" he said.\\n\\nfive people who were found shot to death in\\na homeless encampment near a highway overpass had apparently been\\ntaken by surprise, long beach police commander laura farinelli said\\nmonday.\\n\\n\"maybe they were sleeping when someone came upon them,\" she\\nsaid. \"there\\'s a lot of freeway traffic noise there and it would\\nhave been hard to hear someone approaching or even gunshots.\"\\n\\nlos angeles county coroners have released two of the victims\\'\\nnames, lorenzo perez villicana, 46, and vanessa malaepule, 35, both\\nlong beach residents. the other victims were two other men and one\\nwoman. all five were found clustered in the bushes, sheltered under\\na tarp.\\n\\nauthorities were tipped off by an anonymous caller from a pay\\nphone at 8:30 a.m. sunday morning. the caller offered only vague\\ninformation about several dead people near sante fe avenue and\\nwardlow road near the 405 freeway, said farinelli.\\n\\nfarinelli said that none of the five people were related, but\\nspeculated that the encampment had been occupied for a substantial\\nperiod because of personal items found there.\\n\\ninvestigators were searching other homeless encampments and\\nshelters throughout the area for information about the victims and\\npossible suspects. no arrests have been made.\\n\\nfarinelli said that such multiple killings were extremely rare\\nin long beach, but andy bales of the los angeles union rescue\\nmission said violence against homeless people and between homeless\\npeople is not new.\\n\\nhe cited the case of john robert mcgraham, once a bellman at the\\nnow closed ambassador hotel, who was doused with gasoline and\\nburned alive in los angeles three weeks ago. no arrests have been\\nmade in that case either.\\n\\n\"i often have policemen bringing me pictures of homeless people\\nwho have been beaten to death and asking me information about\\nthem,\" he said. \"but whoever did this sounds like they had a car\\nand they took off from the scene. it appears the people who did\\nthis were not homeless.\"\\n\\nbales was referring to a witness\\' account published in the los\\nangeles times which quoted a resident in a nearby apartment complex\\nwho heard a man shouting at someone to get into a car around the\\ntime of the killings.\\n\\nfarinelli would not confirm on that account.\\n\\naccording to the national coalition for the homeless, violence\\nagainst homeless people increased between 1999 and 2006, even as\\noverall violence decreased nationally. the organization reported\\n142 attacks against homeless people in 2006, compared with about 60\\nin 1999. most of the attackers were 25 years old and younger and\\nabout 40 percent were juveniles according to the organization.\\n\\njoel john roberts of people assisting the homeless, a los\\nangeles advocacy organization for homeless people, said the\\nkillings were a reminder of the vulnerability of the homeless.. he\\nsaid that providing homeless people more police protection was not\\nas effective as getting southern california\\'s tens of thousands of\\nhomeless people off of the streets and into housing.\\n\\nfew places in europe have prospered in recent\\nyears like this bustling crossroads city of 700,000, halfway\\nbetween barcelona and madrid.\\n\\nfactory employees here pulled overtime shifts. companies hired\\ntemporary workers to satisfy growing consumer demand. a half dozen\\nnew bridges were built across the ebro river, and office buildings\\nwere filled as fast as they could be thrown up.\\n\\nthe capital of spain\\'s fastest-growing region, inland zaragoza\\nkept booming even as the overbuilt mediterranean coast came to\\nsymbolize how real estate excess was not just an american ailment.\\n\\nbut just as the cold autumn wind is blowing down from the\\npyrenees, zaragoza and the surrounding region of aragon have\\nsuddenly been hit by a sharp economic downturn. and the troubles\\nhere make clear that what had been seen as a crisis confined\\nlargely to finance and real estate is quickly spreading to more\\nfundamental sectors of the european economy, such as manufacturing.\\n\\nfor the generation of young spaniards who have known only good\\neconomic times the chill is shocking.\\n\\n\"maybe older people are not surprised but this is totally new\\nfor me,\" said francisco braulio, 31, who works for valeo termico,\\na parts makers that supplies the general motors plant here, the\\nautomaker\\'s largest factory in europe.\\n\\nbraulio and his wife, recently married, have put off talk of\\nhaving children for now and to save money they are eating meals and\\nwatching movies at home rather than going out.\\n\\nzaragoza\\'s fate echoes the pattern now unfolding across spain\\nand the rest of europe.\\n\\non monday, the european commission said the 15-nation euro zone\\nappeared to have entered a recession in the third quarter, and\\npredicted the economy would barely recover next year, growing by\\njust 0.1 percent.\\n\\nin madrid, the government announced an economic stimulus program\\nafter a report friday that spain\\'s gross domestic product fell 0.2\\npercent last summer, the nation\\'s first quarterly economic\\ncontraction in 15 years.\\n\\ndespite highly publicized interest rate cuts and more than a\\ntrillion euros in loan guarantees and capital injections by\\ngovernments from london to frankfurt, germany, the situation is\\nexpected to only get worse. european consumer confidence plunged in\\noctober, hitting its lowest point in 15 years.\\n\\n\"it\\'s come very suddenly,\" said jose mendizabal, chief\\nexecutive of pikolin, spain\\'s biggest mattress maker and one of the\\nlargest private employers in this area. \"people are frightened of\\nspending money.\"\\n\\npikolin has already eliminated temporary positions, bringing its\\nwork force down to 1,200 from 1,400. but the slowdown has\\nintensified in recent weeks, with sales now off 15 percent from a\\nyear earlier, and more job cuts are likely if sales do not improve.\\n\\nmendizabal said his customers are a barometer of the broader\\neconomy. first-time home buyers are in the market for lots of new\\nfurnishings while homeowners with discretionary income buy when\\nthey feel flush. now, he said, the former have nearly disappeared\\nand the latter \"are hanging on to their old mattresses.\"\\n\\nwith consumers pulling back, governments that just finished\\nbailing out the financial system are now looking to help the\\nbroader business sector. there is little doubt that both the\\neuropean central bank and the bank of england will cut rates again\\nthis week.\\n\\nin germany, the continent\\'s biggest economy, cabinet approval\\nfor a 50 billion euro, or $63.1 billion, plan to help industry and\\nconsumers, which includes a tax credit for first-time auto\\npurchases, could come as early as wednesday. meanwhile, nicolas\\nsarkozy, the french president, has proposed support for job\\ncreation and a government fund to protect local companies with\\nbeaten-down share prices from \"foreign predators.\"the pain did\\nnot hit home in zaragoza until general motors announced just a few\\nweeks ago that it planned to lay off 600 of its 7,000 workers for\\nup to a year and that it would suspend production for at least two\\nweeks to work off inventories.\\n\\nzaragoza, which at peak capacity is capable of churning out more\\nthan 2,000 subcompacts, small minivans and delivery trucks a day,\\nwas one of seven gm plants in europe to go on hiatus in october.\\n\\nas recently as this past spring, demand was still so strong that\\nromuald rytwinski, the director of the plant, had to rely on\\novertime to produce enough cars.\\n\\nthe overtime disappeared in the summer, but there was little\\nwarning that auto sales would plunge so abruptly.\\n\\nindeed, europe\\'s entire auto sector is now suffering, with\\ndaimler cutting its 2008 earnings forecast by 1 billion euros in\\nlate october, while renault and fiat have also issued profit\\nwarnings.\\n\\n\"in the past, you could forecast demand for a quarter,\"\\nrytwinski said. \"then in the summer, for about a month. now, we\\'re\\ntalking about weeks.\"\\n\\nthe arrival of gm here 26 years ago was the beginning of\\nsomething of an economic miracle for this region, which had been\\nagricultural traditionally and sparsely populated.\\n\\ndrawn by zaragoza\\'s historic location as a crossroads between\\nspanish cities, as well as toulouse in france, gm\\'s arrival spurred\\nthe opening of additional component manufacturers.\\n\\nthe area received another shot in the arm four years ago when\\nzaragoza was chosen to host the 2008 international exposition.\\n\\nwith roughly 1 billion euros provided by the spanish government\\nand other sources to build everything from a glistening new bridge\\ndesigned by zaha hadid to sprawling pavilions and new parkland\\nalong the ebro river, the future looked bright even as troubles\\nwere growing elsewhere. \"people in their 20s and early 30s have\\nnever known anything but prosperity,\" said amado franco, president\\nof aragon\\'s biggest savings bank, ibercaja.\\n\\nat 62, franco has watched zaragoza,

sandra.barreradailynews.com\\n\\n\"soccer has a god. that god is argentine, and his name is diego\\narmando maradona,\" proclaims the web site of the church of\\nmaradona, an online fan club of argentina\\'s unrivaled athletic icon\\nthat claims some 20,000 members.\\n\\nbut this month, diego maradona, the country\\'s 48-year-old\\nsporting titan, will try his hand at an all-too-earthly task:\\nmanaging argentina\\'s men\\'s national team, which has failed to reach\\nthe semifinals of the world cup since \"el diego\" himself starred\\nfor them in 1986 and 1990.\\n\\nafter retiring 11 years ago, maradona has remained in the\\nspotlight primarily as the country\\'s leading real-life soap opera\\nstar, waging a series of well-publicized battles with drugs,\\nobesity, the media and past lovers. now, the hopes and dreams of 40\\nmillion soccer-mad argentines will rest on the shoulders --\\nmuch-slimmed after a stomach-stapling operation in 2005 -- of a man\\nwho, in the words of the local newspaper columnist horacio pagani,\\nwill be \"the least prepared manager in the history of\\ninternational soccer.\"\\n\\ngiven argentina\\'s string of disappointing world cup\\nperformances, the country certainly seems like it could use a\\nsupernatural savior. the team was sent home early by romania in\\n1994, the netherlands in 1998 and germany in 2006, while in 2002 it\\nfailed to qualify for the knockout stage altogether.\\n\\nmaradona has, predictably, brushed off concerns about his\\nreadiness, noting that he spent two decades on the national team.\\n\"soccer hasn\\'t changed,\" he told argentine media. \"i don\\'t think\\nanything will surprise me.\"\\n\\nbut handing him the reins still represents a profound, if not\\nreckless, leap of faith. his managing resume is thin and checkered:\\nin 1994-95, he piloted two argentine teams to just three wins in 23\\ngames, and he was once forced to call the shots from the seats\\nsince a suspension for ephedrine use prevented him from sitting on\\nthe bench. moreover, his personal track record hardly suggests he\\nis fit to keep a 23-man team playing in lockstep: as recently as\\nmarch 2007, rumors of his death circulated wildly while he was\\nhospitalized for alcohol-induced hepatitis.\\n\\nthe controversial selection will not become official until\\nnovember 4, when the executive committee of argentina\\'s national\\nsoccer federation is scheduled to meet. but that group serves as\\nlittle more than a rubber stamp for the decisions of the\\norganization\\'s president, julio grondona, and his pick of maradona\\nis considered a fait accompli.\\n\\ngrondona, who also serves as a vice president of fifa, the\\ngame\\'s international governing body, is widely thought to run the\\nnational sport as his personal fiefdom. over his 29 years in\\noffice, he has regularly been accused of using his influence over\\nreferees, the media, and distribution of revenues to guarantee\\nobedience from the club presidents who elect him -- and to advance\\nhis numerous related business interests. the courts have ordered\\nsome 50 searches of his offices during his presidency, but few\\nformal proceedings have ever been filed against him, and he has\\nnever been found guilty of any crime.\\n\\nthe leading candidate for the job, which became available after\\nthe previous manager resigned last month, was carlos bianchi. as\\nthe manager of boca juniors -- argentina\\'s most popular club, for\\nwhom maradona played in 1981-82 and 1995-97 -- bianchi won four\\ndomestic titles, three continental titles and two intercontinental\\ntitles. but his poor relationship with grondona appears to have\\ndisqualified him for the post.\\n\\nsergio batista, who coached argentina\\'s under-23 team to the\\nolympic gold medal in beijing, was also passed over.\\n\\nmeanwhile, the choice of maradona is sure to increase the\\ninternational profile of the argentine team, which will likely\\nincrease revenues. tickets for his debut match, a nov. 19 date\\nagainst scotland in glasgow, have sold briskly.\\n\\npublic opinion, while divided, seems to lean against the choice:\\nan internet poll conducted by clarin, argentina\\'s largest\\nnewspaper, found that 74 percent of nearly 50,000 voters were\\nopposed. purists are particularly appalled, arguing that maradona\\'s\\nindubitable star power is no substitute for the years on the bench\\naccumulated by other candidates, and that his post-retirement\\nantics put the country\\'s image at risk.\\n\\n\"he was a great player, but nothing more,\" said oscar pereira,\\na union employee in the stands at a local league game on friday\\nnight. \"we need someone more serious. you see him running around\\nwith hugo chavez talking about che guevara.\"\\n\\nmoreover, accusations of cronyism against grondona are flying\\nmore freely than ever. \"whatever money they make off maradona,\\ngrondona and his friends will keep it for themselves,\" said raul\\ngamez, a former president of the velez sarsfield club and one of\\ngrondona\\'s most outspoken critics.\\n\\nbut maradona\\'s mighty stature among argentines still leaves many\\nbelieving he deserves a shot -- or at the very least, that his\\nall-too-public campaign for the position forced grondona\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"we\\'ve had a lot of experienced managers, and they haven\\'t\\nalways done well,\" said alejandro fabbri, a broadcaster for the\\ntyc sports network. \"if maradona wanted the job, he should get it.\\nhe\\'s the greatest argentine player ever. at least they won\\'t be\\nable to say he never got the chance.\"\\n\\nto compensate for maradona\\'s lack of training, grondona has also\\nappointed a team of veteran tacticians to support him, led by\\ncarlos bilardo, who managed maradona on argentina\\'s 1986 world cup\\nchampionship team. with such capable assistants, maradona\\'s\\ndevotees say, he will be able to focus on providing the players\\nwith his special brand of leadership and inspiration.\\n\\n\"he\\'s the biggest name there is,\" said pereira\\'s son, nahuel,\\nwho accompanied him to the game. \"he\\'ll pass on some of his magic\\nto them.\"\\n\\nwhile argentines may disagree over the merits of the decision,\\nthey share a concern for maradona\\'s well-being in his new role --\\nperhaps one even greater than their worries about the direction of\\nthe team as a whole. will maradona the deity survive maradona the\\nmanager?\\n\\n\"i told him he was too big for this job,\" pagani said. \"right\\nnow,

dunham was too sick to travel to see her grandson on the\\ncampaign trail, obama and other family members said that she\\nclosely followed his bid for the presidency through cable\\ntelevision. yet she became a figure in his campaign, seen through\\nimages in television commercials intended to give him a\\nbiographical anchor.\\n\\ndunham, who grew up near august, kan., moved with her husband,\\nstanley dunham, to hawaii. in the early stages of his candidacy,\\nobama spoke wistfully about his grandparents, whose all-american\\nbiography suddenly was critical to establishing his own american\\nstory. he spoke of how his grandmother worked on b-29s at a boeing\\nplant in wichita.\\n\\nfor obama, the loss came on the final full day of his\\npresidential campaign. sen. john mccain

monday, citing higher fuel costs and the economic\\nslowdown.\\n\\nhigher fuel prices accounted for half of ryanair\\'s operating\\ncosts in the six months to sept. 30 -- up from 36 percent a year\\nearlier. the carrier was also stung by write-offs for a 29 percent\\nstake in the irish flag carrier aer lingus, whose value has\\ndeteriorated in the last two years, as well as depreciation in the\\nvalue of aircraft ryanair intends to sell.\\n\\nearnings in the six-month period fell 77 percent, to 95.3\\nmillion euros ($120.8 million) compared with 407.6 million euros in\\nthe period a year earlier.\\n\\nrevenue rose 16 percent, to 1.81 billion euros, from 1.5 billion\\nin the year-ago period.\\n\\nlow-cost and traditional carriers struggled as fuel prices rose\\nto record levels before receding, while at the same time a global\\neconomic slowdown has lowered demand for air travel.\\n\\nryanair shares climbed monday after michael o\\'leary, the chief\\nexecutive, said that profit would rebound in 2009 if oil prices\\nremained at around $80 a barrel.\\n\\nnews that the company had little oil price hedging in place also\\nbuoyed the stock, which closed monday in dublin at 2.83 euros, up 8\\ncents. hedging protects an airline at a time of rising prices, but\\ncan be detrimental when prices decline.\\n\\n\"we have a significant cost advantage over our competitors,\\nmany of whom have hedged fuel next year at significantly higher\\nlevels than current market prices,\" ryanair said in a statement.\\n\"this will force competitors to further increase airfares and\\nwiden the price gap between them and ryanair\\'s lowest fares.\"\\n\\nryanair underlined its confidence by announcing a new price war\\nmonday, flooding the market with a million seats at 10 pounds

unlikely over the course of the\\nnext 18 months.\\n\\no\\'leary last evoked the idea of discount trans-atlantic service\\nin april, before oil prices rose.\\n\\nhe envisaged the airline as a sister

that the project was still at the \"what if\"\\nstage.\\n\\nstill, industry specialists and executives at other low-cost\\nairlines are skeptical about the applicability of the low-cost\\nbusiness model to long-distance routes.\\n\\na wave of violence, including an assassination attempt\\nagainst a deputy oil minister, swept through baghdad and\\nneighboring diyala province on monday.\\n\\nalso on monday, parliament passed a bill that would grant the\\ncountry\\'s embattled minorities fewer guaranteed seats in upcoming\\nelections than the united nations had recommended.\\n\\nthe prospects for enactment of the bill, which requires the\\napproval of iraq\\'s executive council, are unclear. in september,\\nparliament passed a law on provincial elections but, in a\\ncontroversial action, deleted from it an article dealing with\\nrepresentation of iraq\\'s many minorities.\\n\\nthe council, composed of the country\\'s president and two vice\\npresidents, signed that measure into law early last month but\\ndirected parliament to pass separate legislation on the issue.\\n\\nin the most lethal attack of the day, 6 people were killed and\\n20 wounded when two roadside bombs exploded in quick succession in\\nfront of the headquarters of the ministry of interior\\'s criminal\\ninvestigations unit in baghdad\\'s central karada district, according\\nto an official at the ministry who spoke anonymously because he was\\nnot authorized to speak to the media.\\n\\nthe deadlier bomb was planted in front of the protective\\nconcrete wall ringing the government building. the other was about\\n70 yards away. two badly burned bodies lay on the street shortly\\nafter the explosions.\\n\\nthe assassination attempt against the deputy oil minister came\\nabout 30 minutes before the karada blasts. the official, saheb\\nsalman qutub, was wounded, along with his driver, when a bomb\\nplanted in his car exploded, according to a ministry spokesman,\\nasim jihad.\\n\\nthe explosion occurred as qutub was getting into the car at his\\nhome in the northern baghdad neighborhood of atafiya to go to work,\\njihad said.\\n\\nin other violence, a huge car bomb exploded in a parking lot\\nnext to the headquarters of the local government in baqouba in\\ndiyala province, killing at least three people and wounding 13,\\nincluding eight police officers, according to security and\\nprovincial officials.\\n\\nibrahim bajlan, who heads the diyala provincial council, said\\nthe attack was proof that the situation in the province remained\\n\"fragile\" and that the government\\'s lauded recent security\\noperation in diyala had \"only accomplished a fraction of its\\ngoals.\"\\n\\nfourteen other people were wounded in four other bombing attacks\\nin baghdad, according to the official of the interior ministry.\\n\\nin the northern city of mosul, a child was killed and five other\\npeople wounded in a roadside bombing aimed at a police patrol,\\nsecurity

obama or john mccain wants to bring americans together\\nafter the\\npresidential election, there is one proposal that could unite\\nvoters\\nacross\\nthe country. the winner of tuesday\\'s election should pledge to end\\ngender\\ndiscrimination in health insurance for women.\\n\\nin a recent report, the national women\\'s law center found that\\nwomen -\\nboth young and middle-aged - pay dramatically more in most states\\nfor\\nindividual health insurance than men. only 12 states offer gender\\ndiscrimination protection, only eight offer protections for age and\\nonly\\n15\\noffer protections for health status. according to the report,\\ninsurers in\\nnine states and the district of columbia can legally reject\\napplicants who\\nare survivors of domestic violence. in many states, insurers can\\nreject\\nwomen simply for having undergone caesarean sections in the past.\\n\\nthe severity of the problem differs from state to state and from\\nage\\ngroup\\nto age group. the report lists nine states where a 25-year-old\\nwoman would\\npay from 38 percent to 45 percent more for individual coverage than\\nmen of\\nthe same age. and the report lists 27 states where a 40-year-old\\nwoman\\nmight pay from 37 percent to 48 percent more for coverage.\\n\\nrefreshingly, the rules are more equitable in most of new\\nengland.\\nmassachusetts, maine, new hampshire, and vermont all either\\nprohibit or\\nsignificantly limit gender discrimination in the issuance of\\nindividual\\npolicies. the report specifically cited massachusetts\\' effort to\\ndecrease\\ncosts and increase the number of plans available by merging\\nindividual and\\nsmall group markets into one large pool. pooling the markets allows\\nfor\\nspreading risk more broadly and cutting bureaucracy. \"this model\\ncould be\\nadopted by other states, or it could be applied nationally by the\\nfederal\\ngovernment,\" the report said.\\n\\nthree-quarters of the nation\\'s women are largely protected from\\ngender\\ndiscrimination in health insurance, as they get it either from\\ntheir\\nemployers or through public programs. meanwhile, 18 percent of\\nwomen have\\nno insurance at all, and 7 percent have individual plans. taking\\nthe\\ngender\\ngap out of health insurance policies may make them far more\\nattractive to\\nthe 18 percent without insurance.\\n\\ninsurers have all kinds of excuses for discriminating against\\nwomen. in\\nthe new york times, a senior vice president of humana, thomas\\nnoland jr.,\\nsaid, \"premiums for our individual health insurance plans reflect\\nclaims\\nexperience - the use of medical services - which varies by gender\\nand age.\\nfemales use more medical services than males, and this difference\\nis most\\npronounced in young adults.\"\\n\\nnoland went on to say, \"bearing children increases other health\\nrisks\\nlater in life, such as urinary incontinence, which may require\\ntreatment\\nwith medication or surgery.\"\\n\\nnoland\\'s bland explanation cannot hide the neanderthal\\nimplications.\\nhumana\\'s sense of humanity is incontinent. this thinking punishes\\nwomen at\\nleast twice, once for simply having children and again for simply\\ntaking\\nbetter care of their health by seeing doctors more regularly than\\nmacho\\nmen\\nwho wish away the pain in their chests until the surgeon is cutting\\nthem\\nopen in the operating room.\\n\\nthe president of the national women\\'s law center, marcia\\ngreenberger,\\nsaid\\nthat there is no justification for this kind of discrimination,\\nlikening\\nit\\nto using race as a factor.\\n\\nthe winning presidential candidate should incorporate the\\nreport\\'s\\nfinding\\ninto his healthcare plans. mccain has promised high-quality\\ncoverage to\\npeople \"who have the most difficulty on the individual market.\"\\nhis\\n$5,000 tax credit to purchase insurance would be worth less to\\nwomen in\\nmost of the states. ending gender discrimination would be crucial\\nto\\nmaking\\nsuch a tax credit fair.\\n\\nfor obama, who said he will require insurers to cover\\npreexisting\\nconditions, the report represents an immediate opportunity to show\\nsupporters of hillary clinton, who many specialists said had the\\nbest\\nhealthcare plan of all the candidates, that he takes them and\\nwomen\\'s\\nissues in general seriously. obama says he understands that women\\n\"continue to shoulder substantial economic burdens.\"\\n\\nregardless of who wins tuesday, unfair health insurance costs\\nshould be\\none\\nof the first burdens the new president lifts off women\\'s shoulders.\\n\\nderrick z. jackson can be reached at jackson@globe.com.\\n\\nsenior tibetan envoys have been in china since thursday for

of a battle that has\\nlasted for more than two years, with each side predicting\\napocalyptic consequences should it lose.\\n\\nnot the fight for the presidency -- the one pitting google\\nagainst dolly parton.\\n\\nthe titan of silicon valley and the queen of country are two of\\nthe many combatants in a high-technology dispute over precious\\nslices of the nation\\'s airwaves. the issue comes to a head on\\nelection day, when the federal communications commission votes on a\\nproposal to make a disputed chunk of radio spectrum available for\\npublic use.\\n\\ngoogle, microsoft, hewlett-packard and other technology\\ncompanies say the spectrum could be used by a whole new array of\\ninternet-connected wireless gadgets. they say freeing it up would\\nencourage innovation and investment in much the same way that the\\nspread of wi-fi technology has. (this would generate more business\\nfor technology companies.)\\n\\nbut a coalition of old-guard media -- from television networks to\\nbroadway producers -- is objecting to the proposal, saying it needs\\na closer look. the opponents argue that signals sent over those\\nfrequencies could interfere with broadcasts and wireless\\nmicrophones at live productions.\\n\\nthe measure appears likely to pass, though its opponents have\\nmounted a spirited late-stage lobbying effort supported by sen.\\nhillary rodham clinton, d-n.y., and others in congress. also\\nopposed are the professional sports leagues, las vegas casinos, a\\ncoalition of rock musicians and, of late, parton, who is soon to\\nopen a broadway show called \"9 to 5: the musical.\"\\n\\nif the spectrum is set free, parton says, chaos could reign on\\nbroadway -- in the form of static and other interference.\\n\\n\"the potential direct negative impact on countless people may\\nbe immeasurable,\" parton wrote in a letter last month to the fcc,\\nurging it not to release the frequencies.\\n\\nparton became involved after she was contacted by the broadway\\nleague, a theater industry trade group that has lobbied the fcc on\\nthe issue and coordinated support from performers. the trade group\\nsaid parton had been more engaged than other performers because she\\nwas also a producer of live shows.\\n\\nin the digital era, airwaves carrying television, cell phone and\\nwireless internet signals are highly valuable. the fcc regulates\\nthe spectrum and auctions off licenses for its use -- in some cases\\nfor billions of dollars -- to private companies. but in this case it\\nis considering setting aside a free or \"unlicensed\" section for\\npublic use.\\n\\ntechnology companies argue that if it does so, entrepreneurs and\\ninnovators will create a new generation of devices that transmit\\nsignals farther and more reliably than wi-fi, which also relies on\\nunlicensed spectrum. the technology could also handle cheap\\ninternet-based phone calls.\\n\\n\"this could lead to wi-fi on steroids,\" said richard whitt, a\\nwashington lobbyist for google on telecommunications issues. \"it\\ncould become a ubiquitous nationwide broadband network.\"\\n\\nthe battle between the old media and new media companies is a\\nbyproduct of an impending change in the way over-the-air tv signals\\nare delivered. in february, tv stations will be required to switch\\nfrom analog broadcasting to digital, which is less susceptible to\\nradio interference.\\n\\nsince 2004, the fcc has been studying whether it might make\\nbetter use of some \"white spaces,\" tv frequencies that are not\\nbeing used by broadcast channels. these frequencies have\\ntraditionally been left largely empty, because broadcasters send\\nout such powerful signals that a buffer is needed between channels.\\n\\nthe theory behind the fcc proposal is that hand-held devices and\\nother gadgets emit such low levels of power that their\\ntransmissions will not overlap or interfere with the digital tv\\nsignals. also, the proposal\\'s supporters say, devices can be made\\nsmart enough to sense when they might interfere with a broadcast\\nsignal and find another frequency.\\n\\nthe fcc has been studying the potential for interference and\\nfound that most problems can be avoided through tight regulation of\\nthe new devices, said kevin j. martin, chairman of the fcc, who\\nproposed the white space measure.\\n\\n\"we\\'re being very cautious about protecting the broadcasters,\\nbut at the same time making sure the technology allows us to make\\ngreater use of this invaluable resource,\" martin said.\\n\\nhe added that he thought some opponents, like the broadcasters,\\nwere fighting the proposal because they were unnerved by the rise\\nof interactive tools that offered a less passive media experience.\\n\"the empowerment of consumers is threatening,\" he said.\\n\\nthe five-member commission seems likely to approve the measure,\\naccording to several people who were involved in the agency\\'s\\ninternal discussions but who declined to be named because they were\\nnot authorized to speak to the media.\\n\\nbeneath the surface of the debate are shifts in politics and\\nculture. heavy internet and computer adoption by consumers has\\ngiven the technology lobby more power and prominence. at the same\\ntime, the broadcast industry has lost some of its lobbying sway as\\nconsumer tastes have changed and advertising dollars have flowed to\\nthe internet.\\n\\nstill, the national association of broadcasters, which\\nrepresents 8,300 local and national television stations, is helping\\nlead the effort to get the fcc to postpone a decision on the\\nmeasure.\\n\\nwithout more testing, \"this could be a recipe for potentially\\nmassive interference into the television spectrum,\" said dennis\\nwharton, a spokesman for the broadcasting trade group, arguing that\\ntv screens could go temporarily dark or that pictures could freeze.\\nbroadcasters say the signal could even disrupt channels received\\nover cable.\\n\\nthe interests of tv providers is different from those of\\nbroadway theaters, which rely on wireless microphones to broadcast\\nsound to the audience and for communication among crew members.\\n\\ngerald schoenfeld, chairman of the shubert organization, a\\nbroadway production company, said new gadgets that were intended to\\nuse the disputed frequencies could interfere with the 450 wireless\\nmicrophones used in new york\\'s theater district. that could lead to\\nstatic, he said, or worse -- if, for instance, crew member\\ncommunications were hindered, causing an accident such as a falling\\nset piece.\\n\\n\"there\\'s a danger element attached to this,\" schoenfeld said.\\n\"they are fooling with many aspects of american society under the\\npretext of helping get internet access for parties that already\\nhave the greatest amount of internet usage.\"\\n\\nurging a delay on the vote, schoenfeld added: \"why this is\\nbeing rushed through at this time is mystifying.\"\\n\\nthe wireless microphone technology used for broadway shows and\\nother events uses some of the same frequencies that regulators\\nwould like to open up for wireless data. but under the fcc\\nproposal, these incumbent users would be given first rights to the\\nspace.\\n\\nin her letter to the fcc, parton conceded that she did not\\nunderstand all the technicalities of the debate. but based on the\\ncounsel of others, she concluded that the potential problems were\\nserious: \"a dangerous and shortsighted answer to a highly\\ncomplicated question.\" the broadway league and parton\\'s\\nrepresentatives said she was too busy to comment further.\\n\\nfor his part, eric e. schmidt, the chief executive of google,\\nsent his own letter to the fcc recently.\\n\\n\"we are eight days away from a vote that could transform the\\nway we connect to the internet,\" he wrote. \"the time for study\\nand talk is over. the time for action has arrived.\"\\n\\nand so it ends. the longest, most expensive, and riveting campaign\\nin living\\nmemory is finally over. it has been an international cliff-hanger,\\nwith\\npeople in europe, africa, and asia following every little twist and\\nturn as\\navidly as anyone in the united states. for even though they may not\\nhave\\nthe vote, all the world knows the importance of america\\'s choice.\\n\\nseldom has there been such an all-encompassing drama. it seems\\nalmost too\\ntheatrical remembering now how the clintons, so full of confidence\\nand\\nentitlement, were brought low by a newcomer of whom most people had\\nnever\\nheard five years before. and john mccain, his campaign in tatters\\nand out\\nof money in new hampshire, prevailing over the deep{ndash}pocketed\\nmitt\\nromney, whose positions kept shifting with the political winds.\\n\\nbooks and magazines are full of advice on what our new president\\nfaces in\\nhis first term. pundits are saying that not since franklin\\nroosevelt, or\\nperhaps abraham lincoln, has the task been so daunting, given the\\nmesses\\nthat president bush and dick cheney are leaving on the white house\\nfloor.\\ntwo unfinished wars, a national debt rising to dangerous levels, an\\narmy\\nstretched to the breaking point, and an economy in shambles limit\\nthe\\nability of a new president to carry out anything new.\\n\\ngiven the political establishment\\'s inertia, the lack of\\nmaneuver room the\\nnew president will have, and the all-but insurmountable\\ndifficulties he\\nfaces, it may be, as a recent new yorker cartoon suggested, that\\nreal\\nchange can only be found in drink during the \"change you can\\nbelieve in\\nhour\" at your local bar.\\n\\nlooking back, the most amazing aspect of the bush years was not\\nthe\\narrogance and imperial over-reach. it was its sheer incompetence.\\nit was\\nsomething unexpected when bush came to power, given his team: colin\\npowell,\\ndonald rumsfeld, and, yes, dick cheney. i thought at least they\\ncould get\\nthings done, for better or worse.\\n\\nbut it became clear before their armies reached baghdad that\\nthis was a\\nquick, unplanned dash with no follow-through. how agonizingly slow\\nthe\\nadministration was to admit even to an insurgency in iraq. how slow\\nit was\\nto recognize the damage that hurricane katrina had inflicted, and\\nhow slow\\nit was to realize that pushing reagan-era deregulation too far was\\nabout to\\nbeggar us all.\\n\\nalthough bush has been keeping such a low profile up to now that\\nmany\\ncould be forgiven for thinking he has already left office, the grim\\nand\\nsobering truth is that he has 77 days left in power, enough time to\\ndo a\\nlot of mischief. the administration is now free of any\\nresponsibility to\\nthe republican party or the election. as for the american people,\\nthey were\\nnever considered by this administration to be anything more than an\\nentity\\nto be manipulated and lied to in the interest of unrestricted\\nexecutive\\npower.\\n\\nthe danger of an american attack on iran has now passed. there\\nwould be\\nstiff resistance from the pentagon, and the neoconservative hawks\\nthat held\\nsuch sway in bush\\'s first administration are now in eclipse. bush\\nand\\ncheney might give israel the green light, however. i was told by a\\nsource\\nwhom i trust that prime minister ehud olmert of israel sought a\\npromise\\nfrom bush that he would bomb iran before he left office. such an\\nattack\\nwould delay, not stop, iran from building a bomb, and the results\\nof an\\nattack, the political fallout in the middle east and around the\\nworld,\\nwould be the only thing worse than iran having a bomb.\\n\\nto bring about real change in the world, the new president will\\nhave to\\nrethink and reorganize the entire concept of preventive war and the\\nso-called war on terror. as the author thomas powers wrote\\nrecently, what\\n\"no country can do for long ((is)) force strange people in distant\\nplaces\\nto reshape their politics and society

3.\\n\\nfew actions by a new president would draw a clearer distinction\\nwith\\npresident bush than a pledge on inauguration day to close the\\nguantanamo\\nbay detention center and to adhere to the geneva conventions in the\\nhandling of war on terror prisoners.\\n\\nduring the campaign, both john mccain and barack obama called\\nfor closing\\nguantanamo, which has become a symbol of the bush administration\\'s\\nhuman-rights abuses. mccain proposed a sensible alternative: the\\nmilitary\\nprison at fort leavenworth, kansas. even bush has said he wants to\\nshutter\\nthe cuban prison, but he has made no progress toward doing so.\\n\\nsimply duplicating the legal conditions of guantanamo on us soil\\nwould do\\nlittle to restore america\\'s reputation as a human-rights leader,\\nhowever.\\nthe new president must also act quickly to return to prisoners the\\nrights\\ndenied by congress in 2006.\\n\\nthat is why it would be so important for the new president to\\nrepledge us\\nadherence to the geneva conventions. common article 3 holds that\\ntrials of\\nboth prisoners of war and of captured combatants not granted that\\nstatus\\nmust adhere to judicial guarantees \"recognized as indispensable by\\nall\\ncivilized peoples.\" the supreme court has already ruled that\\ncongress\\nacted unconstitutionally in stripping prisoners of their habeas\\ncorpus\\nrights. the 2006 law also permits evidence gained through coercive\\nmethods,\\nand limits inmates\\' rights to confront witnesses.\\n\\nabout 255 prisoners remain at guantanamo of the more than 700\\nbrought\\nthere. most have returned to their home countries. in the almost\\nseven\\nyears since the military began sending detainees there, just two\\nhave been\\nconvicted of any criminal offense. federal criminal courts in the\\nunited\\nstates, on the other hand, have successfully tried and convicted\\nsuch major\\nterrorists as shoe-bomber richard reid and the sept. 11 conspirator\\nzacarias moussaoui, as well as other foreign and domestic\\nterrorists from\\nthe pre-sept. 11 era.\\n\\nhuman-rights advocates disagree on whether a new president could\\nswitch\\nprisoners to federal courts from the military commission tribunals\\nby\\nexecutive order. some believe he would need congress to repeal or\\ndrastically amend the 2006 law.\\n\\nwhatever the case, the new president should make closing\\nguantanamo and\\nshifting its inmates to federal court jurisdiction a priority for\\nhis first\\n100 days.\\n\\nfour years ago this month, hundreds of thousands\\nof people took to the streets of this capital city to take back an\\nelection they saw as stolen. that outpouring, called the orange\\nrevolution, brought fresh hopes for freedoms and for a release from\\nthe country\\'s soviet past that few other former republics had ever\\nexperienced.\\n\\nthe early promise of those days frayed in recent years, but\\neconomically times were good, and the country always seemed to\\nmanage.\\n\\nbut now, confronted by the global financial crisis, the new\\nukraine is facing the single biggest test of its stability, and its\\nleaders, by most accounts, seem to be at risk of failing.\\n\\nprime minister yulia v. tymoshenko and president viktor a.\\nyushchenko, former political allies, are now locked in a bitter\\npower struggle that has paralyzed the state, leaving it without a\\nleader at precisely the time it most needs one.\\n\\neven as the west bends to help it, with the international\\nmonetary fund pledging an emergency $16.5 billion loan last month,\\nit barely pulled itself together to meet the conditions for the\\nmoney. yushchenko, intent on getting rid of tymoshenko, is trying\\nto force early elections for december. to make sure the elections\\ncome off, his party spent most of last week trying to slip a\\ncampaign finance clause into the legislation package that was\\nrequired for the loan.\\n\\non monday he relented and signed the crisis legislation into law\\nwithout the clause. but his administration continued to insist that\\nthe elections proceed.\\n\\n\"it is a crime to conduct elections in this situation,\" said\\nyulia mostova, editor in chief of dzerkalo tyzhnya, a weekly\\nnewspaper published in kiev. \"the chain of authority in ukraine is\\nbroken. it\\'s at war with itself.\"\\n\\nukraine\\'s paralysis raises difficult questions for the west. it\\nis a country of 46 million in a strategic spot between european\\nunion countries and russia, and its stability is crucial to the\\nregion.\\n\\nyushchenko has taken a combative approach toward russia, which\\ndemonstrated a new willingness to settle disputes by force in\\ngeorgia this summer. he has pushed for ukraine to join nato, an\\nagenda that is not particularly popular among ukrainians, 17\\npercent of whom are ethnic russians. and he has vowed not to renew\\na contract that allows russia\\'s black sea fleet to dock in a\\nukrainian port. on saturday, a ban on russian cable television\\nprogramming went into effect.\\n\\nfor ukrainians, the fears are more about their immediate future.\\nat one point last week, their currency hit its lowest point since\\nit was introduced in 1996, and securities that insure ukrainian\\ngovernment debt are trading at near-default levels.\\n\\nbut perhaps their greatest disappointment is over their leaders,\\nwhose energies are focused not on ways to lift the country out of\\ncrisis, but instead on what is widely seen as a selfish struggle\\nover power.\\n\\n\"people feel let down to the point of tears,\" mostova said.\\n\"many feel they\\'ve been used. ukraine had a chance for a\\nqualitative, civilized jump forward, but it wasn\\'t taken.\"\\n\\nukraine\\'s economy is particularly vulnerable. about 40 percent\\nof its foreign currency earnings come from the sale of industrial\\nmetals, which have plunged in price in recent weeks. and while its\\ngovernment has borrowed responsibly, its banks have not, having\\ntaken billions of dollars in foreign currency loans. with global\\ncredit markets drying up, those loans will be difficult to\\nrefinance. ukraine\\'s central bank has already had to bail out one,\\nprominvestbank, the country\\'s sixth largest.\\n\\ndespite the turmoil, yushchenko\\'s main focus in recent weeks has\\nbeen on attacking tymoshenko. he has issued presidential decrees\\nblocking the majority of her decisions since she became prime\\nminister for the second time in december. she accused him of\\ncommandeering her plane shortly before she was to take off on a\\ntrip to russia in october, an allegation he denied. and when a\\njudge in kiev ruled that the president\\'s decree to dissolve the\\nparliament and call elections was illegal, yushchenko simply\\ndisbanded the court.\\n\\n\"yushchenko thinks he is god,\" said mikhail pogrebinsky, a\\npolitical analyst at a research and polling center in kiev, citing\\nas evidence yushchenko\\'s visit last week to istanbul, where he gave\\npatriarch bartholomew i of the eastern orthodox church a specially\\nminted coin with his image on it, while at home his country\\'s\\ncurrency was plummeting. \"he thinks his own fate and the fate of\\nthe country are the same thing.\"\\n\\ntymoshenko is also capable of political magic tricks. last year\\nshe colluded with yushchenko, withdrawing all her deputies from\\nparliament to give him legal justification for dissolving it and\\ncalling new elections.\\n\\nneither has ever liked the other. tymoshenko, a former gas\\nindustry executive whose head is wreathed in a signature blond\\nplait, is ukraine\\'s political celebrity.\\n\\nyushchenko, a former banker whose own popularity has plunged in\\nrecent years, has lashed out. there are even hints of the political\\nfight in yushchenko\\'s infamous poisoning episode, which left his\\nface pockmarked and ravaged in 2004: a lineup of his political\\nopponents have been called in for questioning in the case.\\n\\ntymoshenko came from ukraine\\'s business world, where quick wits\\nand bare knuckles made fortunes in the 1990s, under the corrupt\\ngovernment of president leonid d. kuchma. but her aim appeared to\\nbe less money than power, and she later joined the government. she\\nand yushchenko rose up against kuchma in 2004 with the motto,\\n\"bandits to prisons,\" but they soon grew beholden to yet another\\nset of wealthy men.\\n\\noleg o. zarubinsky, a member of parliament from an opposition\\nparty, put it bluntly: \"our political parties aren\\'t funded by\\nmembership fees.\"\\n\\noleksandr s. donii, a ukrainian lawmaker who led a popular\\nstudent movement against the soviet regime in 1990, compared\\nukraine\\'s first generation businessmen to divers dizzy with the\\nbends. \"the ukrainian business elite was born too quickly,\" he\\nsaid. \"there were few moral limits. there was no sense of social\\nresponsibility, of sharing with retirees.\"\\n\\nthe country\\'s current predicament is not entirely the fault of\\nits leaders. it runs much deeper, into the roots of ukrainian\\nsociety. communism pitted citizens against one another, leaving\\npeople distrustful and incapable of the collective action that\\nholds governments accountable in developed countries.\\n\\n\"we trust our brother, son, father, mother and godfather, but\\nno one else,\" said mostova, the editor. \"that\\'s our problem.\"\\n\\nthat is why the orange revolution was so important: it seemed to\\nbreak that pattern.\\n\\n\"people found their backbones,\" mostova said. \"they cried in\\nfront of strangers.\"\\n\\nbut after the protests were over, there was little follow-up. no\\ncommittees, associations or new communities. the crowd came\\ntogether and then broke apart.\\n\\nstill, the fact that it happened at all was a big step forward\\nfor ukraine, which has been independent for only 17 years, and is\\nnow going through a period that pogrebinsky compares with the\\ntumultuous late 18th century in the united states, during the\\nratification of the constitution.\\n\\nthe economic crisis, for all its pain, may also be a catalyst.\\nfinancial turmoil has swept out governments in indonesia, turkey\\nand russia in recent history, and even, many argue, the soviet\\nunion. today\\'s ukraine may be similarly susceptible.\\n\\ntymoshenko seems to realize this. in a television talk show\\nabout the economic crisis on friday night, she extended a hand to\\nyushchenko: \"let\\'s for once not get into these political dogfights\\nand come together as a national team with a united program, like\\nthe president said,\" she declared, addressing the other political\\nleaders seated in the studio. \"be a team in the face of this big\\nglobal challenge.\"\\n\\nyushchenko did not return the favor. he accused tymoshenko\\'s\\ngovernment of accumulating debts from energy purchases \"like fleas\\non a dog,\" and of allowing inflation to rise.\\n\\n\"who did it?\" he railed. \"the world crisis? lies! the crisis\\nis sitting right here.\"\\n\\ntuesday would just be the beginning, the candidates kept telling\\nus, the start of a new era in american public life. but for\\neveryone from pollsters to pundits to a public that\\'s been immersed\\nin an historic and closely monitored campaign for nearly two years,\\nelection day also represents the end of a long and exhausting story\\nline. is the country in for an emotional and psychological letdown\\nnow that the climax finally has arrived?\\n\\n\"this year, more than in a very long time, come the day after\\nthe election it\\'s going to feel like the entire nation has woken up\\nin a collective political equivalent of dec. 26,\" predicts robert\\nthompson, founding director of the bleier center for television and\\npopular culture at syracuse university. \"the presents look more\\npromising before they\\'re opened. the tree is starting to look a\\nlittle funky. reality sets in.\"\\n\\nthompson argues that because the 2008 campaign has had so many\\nunprecedented factors, including the first serious runs for the\\nwhite house by both an african american and a woman, an economic\\ncrisis that \"gave everyone a life-and-death stake in the outcome\"\\nand the heightened proliferation of political satire on \"saturday\\nnight live\" and elsewhere, the fall-off from this\\n\"extraordinarily resonant and mythic american narrative\" could be\\nespecially steep.\\n\\nswitching metaphors from christmas to television, thompson says\\nthe period between election day and the inauguration of a new\\npresident in january might feel like \"those times when \\'the\\nsopranos\\' was on hiatus.\\n\\n\"this has been the greatest series on television,\" he says.\\n\"and now it\\'s stopped. but it will pick up again in january. that\\nshould bring back some of the \\'pump\\' and ceremony.\"\\n\\nelissa epel, an associate professor in the psychiatry department\\nat the university of california at san francisco, invokes soap\\noperas and shakespearean tragedy to conjure up the aftermath of the\\nelection.\\n\\n\"people have been glued to the news each day,\" she said in an\\ne-mail interview, likening the draw of this election season to that\\nof a daytime tv drama. the end of that, said epel, could \"bring in\\nnuances of \\'letdown.\"\\' but she also envisions a more layered\\nresponse.\\n\\neven as the conclusion of the soap opera might signal \"the\\nbeginning of a new era,\" epel foresees a possibly demanding shift\\nof focus. \"people will be less plugged into the political pundits\\neach day. they will start to pay attention to neglected longer-term\\nissues -- how to survive the recession, how to take of their family\\nand health better. we may notice we are in one of the most\\nstressful eras is recent history.\"\\n\\nas for mccain, epel sees \"a protagonist who can\\'t see the flaws\\nin his negative campaigning.\" supporters of this modern-day\\nshakespearean figure, she said, \"will no doubt feel a tremendous\\npain after tuesday\\'s last scene with their sunken hero.\"\\n\\nrepublican operatives are trying to look beyond today\\'s vote\\ntallies. \"win or lose, historically,\" says california republican\\nparty chairman ron nehring, \"the day after the election,\\neverything a candidate has built tends to disappear into the ether.\\nthe party is very different. we\\'re open for business and\\noperating.\" nehring ticks off gains in fundraising, precinct\\norganizing and \"permanent infrastructure\" over the past couple of\\nyears. \"we\\'re already in the 2010 election cycle,\" he says.\\n\\ndemocrats, meanwhile, are hoping to capitalize on anticipated\\nwins in both the national and congressional races. chuck carpenter,\\nchairman of the contra costa democratic party, says he has been\\nthinking about a post-election letdown and points to a core of baby\\nboom-age women who have been working phone banks in walnut creek,\\ncalif.\\n\\n\"they\\'ve become really tight,\" says carpenter. \"it\\'s more\\nlike a club than a job.\" while one member plans to catch up on her\\nneglected business of restoring antiques and another hopes to get\\nher garden ready for winter, carpenter expects many to remain\\nactive in the newly formed contra costa democratic club for change.\\n\\npollster john zogby sees no immediate letdown for the country.\\npredicting an obama win, he says, \"this election is\\ntransformational. i am suggesting that 2009 will be one of the very\\nfew years of major reform in american history.\"\\n\\nzogby concedes that \"a letdown will come eventually.\\nexpectations are very high for immediate action from the new\\nadministration.\"\\n\\nas for a slump in his own seemingly seasonal business, he adds,\\n\"only 9 per cent of our income is political. we\\'re back to work\\nfor fortune 500 companies and little pizza parlors. plus there\\'s a\\nmayoral election in new york city next year.\"\\n\\ncomedy, which has been a major subplot of the \\'08 campaign,\\ncould come in for its own share of restructuring tomorrow.\\n\\n\"my career\\'s over,\" moans stand-up comic will durst, in mock\\nlament for a likely republican defeat. \"for those of us who had to\\ngo cold turkey on a lame-duck george bush, sarah palin was like a\\ndose of methadone. now what? this time next year, i\\'ll be standing\\nbehind some counter asking if you want a lid on that coffee or\\nnot.\"\\n\\nfellow stand-up comedian nato green says the bush years \"have\\nmade it easy to be lazy -- anyone could recycle a redneck joke and\\nget a laugh.\" if obama is elected, he continues, \"it\\'s going to\\nimpose more market discipline on comics who want to bring forward a\\npoint of view and perspective. some people think it will be hard to\\nmake fun of obama because he\\'s black. i think it\\'s because he\\'s\\nrelatively lucid.\"\\n\\nas for the national parodists and pundits who have attracted\\nviewers in the run-up to this closely watched election, thompson\\nsays it may take a while to see how they fare in the post-election\\nperiod. tina fey, whose profile rose with her spot-on mimicry of\\nsarah palin, saw the ratings for her prime-time series \"30 rock\"\\nhit their highest numbers ever with last week\\'s third-season\\npremiere. part of that might be due to her emmy wins in september,\\nbut part of it also has to do with her ability to mimic the alaska\\ngovernor. it remains to be seen if such ratings will hold up a\\nmonth from now.\\n\\nthompson points out that big news stories can cement a media\\ncareer long after the story itself has passed. greta van susteren\\nwas \"made\" by the o.j. simpson trial. wolf blitzer found his\\nfooting in the first gulf war. since many viewers now follow\\nspecific and often opinionated cable personalities like bill\\no\\'reilly or keith olbermann, those brand names could be immune to\\nany post-partum let-down cable viewers feel after the votes are\\ncounted.\\n\\n\"rachel maddow is now beating larry king in the ratings,\"\\nthompson points out. \"i don\\'t think she\\'s going to go away.\"\\n\\n\"a lot of us are waiting to see how it all shakes out,\" says\\ngreen. \"i was raised as a progressive and an activist. but i\\'m\\nalso a contrarian by nature. my job, it seems, will be to discover\\nthe ways in which obama makes me boil with rage.\"\\n\\ndenver -- the denver nuggets have traded all-star guard allen\\niverson to the detroit pistons for denver native and fellow guard\\nchauncey billups, as well as forward antonio mcdyess and center\\ncheikh samb, the team announced at a news conference monday\\nafternoon.\\n\\nwhen asked if the nuggets are a better team today than\\nyesterday, coach george karl said, \"i think we will be. he\\'s the\\npackage that fits.\"\\n\\nkarl has often cited the need for a top flight point guard in\\nthe nba and in the past lamented losing andre miller in the trade\\nto philadelphia for iverson. the nuggets acquired iverson in a\\nblockbuster trade in december 2006, but he was unable to help get\\nthe team past the first round of the playoffs.\\n\\niverson\\'s agent, leon rose, said, \"ai had a great run in\\ndenver. he really enjoyed playing in denver. this is an opportunity\\nto go back to the east, to one of the elite teams and a great\\nopportunity for him to have a chance to go deep into the playoffs.\\n\\n\"he\\'s very excited about the opportunity. i don\\'t want to say\\nhe needs to be rejuvenated, but i think he\\'s very excited and he\\nwill continue to compete at that very high level.\"\\n\\nbillups, 32, won nba finals mvp honors when he led detroit to\\nthe crown in 2004. he now returns home to bolster his hometown\\nteam\\'s backcourt.\\n\\nmark warkentien, nuggets director of basketball operations,\\nannounced that the team had released veteran forward juwan howard\\nto free up a roster spot. it is likely that howard will be\\nre-signed, however. sources close to the nuggets said the team\\nplans to buy out mcdyess\\'s contract, leaving him free to re-sign\\nwith detroit. it was necessary for denver to get mcdyess in the\\ntrade to match salaries.\\n\\ndetroit plans to use young point guard rodney stuckey in the\\nbackcourt with the 33-year-old iverson, who was in the final year\\nof his contract and making $20.8 million. billups is in the second\\nyear of a four-year deal worth $46 million.\\n\\nbillups, 6-foot-3, was a denver prep league star before reviving\\nthe university of colorado\\'s program.\\n\\nthrough 11 nba seasons, billups has averaged 14.8 points per\\ngame, 5.5 assists and 2.9 rebounds and has made three all-star\\nteams.\\n\\nbillups helped lead the pistons to six consecutive eastern\\nconference finals from 2003-08.\\n\\nmcdyess, 6-9, 245, returns to denver after spending the best\\nseasons of his career as a nugget from 1995-97 and 2000-02,\\naveraging 18.2 points and 9 rebounds.\\n\\nsamb, 7-1, 245, has not appeared in a game this season. he\\naveraged 1.8 points in four games with detroit last year. samb, 24,\\nalso played 20 games with fort wayne of the nba development league\\nduring the 2007-08 season, posting averages of 10.4 points and 6.8\\nrebounds.\\n\\nhe was originally drafted by the los angeles lakers in the\\nsecond round (51st overall) of the 2006 nba draft. his draft rights\\nwere traded to detroit on june 28, 2006.\\n\\nat least one broadcast network and one web site said monday that\\nthey could foresee signaling to viewers early tuesday evening which\\ncandidate appeared likely to win the presidency, despite the\\nunreliability of early exit polls in the last presidential\\nelection.\\n\\na senior vice president of cbs news, paul friedman, said the\\nprospects for barack obama or john mccain meeting the minimum\\nthreshold of electoral votes could be clear as soon as 8 p.m. --\\nbefore polls in even new york and rhode island close, let alone\\nthose in texas and california. at such a moment -- determined from a\\ncombination of polling data and samples of actual votes -- the\\nnetwork could share its preliminary projection with viewers,\\nfriedman said.\\n\\n\"we could know virginia at 7,\" he said. \"we could know\\nindiana before 8. we could know florida at 8. we could know\\npennsylvania at 8. we could know the whole story of the election\\nwith those results. we can\\'t be in this position of hiding our\\nheads in the sand when the story is obvious.\"\\n\\nsimilarly, the editor of slate, david plotz, said in an e-mail\\nmessage that \"if obama is winning heavily,\" he could see calling\\nthe race \"sometime between 8 and 9.\"\\n\\n\"our readers are not stupid, and we shouldn\\'t engage in a weird\\nkabuki drama that pretends mccain could win california and thus the\\npresidency,\" plotz wrote. \"we will call it when a sensible person\\n-- not a tv news anchor who has to engage in a silly pretense about\\nwest coast voters -- would call it.\"\\n\\nall the networks (and other news organizations with their own\\nweb sites) were engaging in similar debates on monday about\\nstriking the following balance: not relying too much on early exit\\npoll data -- which had suggested, at least early on election day in\\n2004, that john kerry might be on track to defeat george w. bush --\\nwhile not being so cautious as to be beaten to the punch by a\\ncompetitor who announces an emerging result first.\\n\\nwhen asked how katie couric, who is leading the network\\'s\\ncoverage, might present the network\\'s projection to viewers,\\nfriedman said he could imagine her saying, for example, \"given\\nwhat we know about the results, or the projected results in various\\nstates, it\\'s beginning to look like it will be very difficult for\\njohn mccain to put together enough votes to win this election.\"\\n\\nthe decision desk director of abc news, dan merkle, said, \"i\\nthink at abc we\\'re going to be more cautious than that, in terms of\\ntelegraphing which way the election is going.\" merkle said he was\\nparticularly concerned about how much stock to put in surveys of\\nvoters as they leave the polls, \"which are sometimes fine, and\\nwhich sometimes have had overstatements on democratic candidates in\\nparticular.\"\\n\\n\"we may have some indications from that data,\" merkle said.\\n\"that\\'s different than going on the air to report that.\"\\n\\nwith some national polls suggesting that obama was heading for a\\npotential electoral landslide, news organizations were preparing\\nfor a race that could be far less close than those in 2004 or 2000.\\nthe nearest precedent could be 1980, when the networks projected\\nronald reagan to have defeated jimmy carter shortly after the polls\\nclosed in the east. later, the secretaries of state from\\nwashington, oregon and other western states argued that, as a\\nresult of the networks\\' early call that year, voter turnout in\\ncalifornia dropped by about 2 percent.\\n\\nother experts, though, have argued that any impact by the\\nnetworks on turnout was far outweighed by jimmy carter\\'s having\\nmade a concession speech shortly after the networks broadcast their\\nresults.\\n\\nwhatever the networks decide, it seemed clear on monday that\\nthey would disregard a plea by rep. john d. dingell, d-mich., to\\nhold off projecting a winner until polls in the last state had\\nclosed. those would be alaska\\'s, which are to remain open until 1\\na.m. on the east coast.\\n\\n\"when a candidate gets 270 electoral votes, they\\'re the next\\npresident,\" said sheldon gawiser, director of elections for nbc\\nnews. \"if some states are still voting, it\\'s an unfortunate\\ncircumstance, that\\'s what it is. the founding fathers never\\nexpected us to count the votes fast.\"\\n\\nin something of a compromise, cnn said it might tell its viewers\\nthat another news organization had called a particular state, but\\nthat it was holding off, and for what reason.\\n\\nin 2004, early exit poll data that suggesting kerry was ahead\\nbegan circulating within newsrooms -- and leaking out on web sites,\\nincluding slate\\'s -- early in the afternoon on election day. this\\nyear, the consortium of six news organizations gathering the exit\\npoll data -- nbc, abc, cbs, fox, cnn and the associated press -- have\\nagreed to keep the information under quarantine until 5 p.m.\\nrepresentatives of those news organizations will begin analyzing\\nthat information at a secret location beginning in late morning,\\nbut will have to surrender all electronic devices at the door; even\\nrestroom visits will be supervised. there were already signs on\\nmonday that the additional security was paying off.\\n\\n\"we won\\'t call it off exit polls,\" plotz said, \"in part\\nbecause we don\\'t expect to get them leaked to us much before the\\nfirst results.\"\\n\\nwhoever gets elected president on tuesday, one hot-button issue\\nfrom this long campaign will keep hounding wall street: executive\\npay.\\n\\nboth barack obama and john mccain have criticized the six- and\\nseven-figure paychecks that wall street\\'s top brass collected in\\nrecent years while driving their companies -- and the entire\\nfinancial system -- into the ground.\\n\\nboth candidates have said the heads-we-win, tails-you-lose pay\\nschemes that seem all too common in finance lie at the heart of the\\ncrisis that threatens the whole economy. even some senior\\nexecutives have confessed to me that they agree.\\n\\nso many people agree that the pay system is broken. it is clear\\nthat rewarding executives for delivering a few quarters of outsize\\nprofits or a share price that keeps rising (until it doesn\\'t) only\\nencourages those executives to take risks. and managing risks\\nhasn\\'t exactly been wall street\\'s forte lately.\\n\\nthe question is, how should pay be fixed? now that american\\ntaxpayers are shareholders in the nation\\'s largest banks, a bevy of\\nplans is making the rounds.\\n\\nsome in washington want to cap pay, period. executive can make\\nonly so much and no more.\\n\\nothers argue for \"claw-backs.\" that is, they want executives\\nwho got rich while their companies were reporting fat profits to be\\nforced to give some of the money back. after all, much of the\\nindustry\\'s profits from the boom have been vaporized in the bust.\\n\\nand still others have even come up with fancy formulas to rein\\nin pay.\\n\\nthe issue has become such a nail-biter for big banks that some\\nare even considering curbing pay voluntarily. top executives hope\\nsuch a move, coming in a year when pay is already plummeting, might\\nquiet the rhetoric.\\n\\nit won\\'t.\\n\\nwhile various plans are being bandied about, one in particular\\ndeserves attention. it comes from raghuram g. rajan, a professor of\\nfinance at the graduate school of business at the university of\\nchicago and former chief economist at the international monetary\\nfund.\\n\\nrajan is a longtime critic of executive pay on wall street. but\\nhe\\'s not a knee-jerk, all-big-bonuses-are-bad critic. instead, he\\'s\\na pretty thoughtful, pay-for-performance capitalist who has been\\nstudying ways to create the right incentives for the system to\\nwork.\\n\\nhe has a multi-pronged approach that would give banks a choice.\\nunder the first option, the government would strictly regulate\\ncompensation. under the second, banks could pay their executives\\nwhatever they like -- provided the banks set aside more capital. in\\nother words, banks that cling to their free-wheeling ways would\\nhave to pay some sort of price.\\n\\nfor rajan, this is an either-or proposition. if banks pursue\\ncurrent compensation policies -- what might be described as the\\n\"no-responsibility\" system, given the trouble we\\'re in -- that\\'s\\nfine.\\n\\nbut if that happens, \"the government should levy more capital\\nrequirements against the bank,\" he said. requiring banks to have\\nhigher capital requirements would reduce the risk that executives\\nwill make stupid decisions that imperil the firm and, possibly, the\\nnation\\'s financial health.\\n\\nhow much extra capital? that depends. if banks spread out\\nexecutives\\' pay over, say, four years, giving their executives an\\nincentive to make smart decisions for the long haul, the banks\\nwould be allowed to set aside a bit less additional capital.\\n\\nditto if they included claw-back provisions and required\\nexecutives to reinvest a substantial portion of their income in\\ntheir companies so they had some skin in the game.\\n\\n\"we need to make people a little more worried about the\\nfuture,\" rajan said. the way things are now, executives are\\nencouraged to take big risks because they get paid based on the\\nimmediate fees generated. they have little incentive to worry about\\nwhat might happen to the balance sheet later.\\n\\nrajan said he was unimpressed by efforts to pay executives\\npartially in stock. owning shares in the entire company doesn\\'t tie\\nbankers\\' compensation directly to the decisions they make within\\ntheir own units. \"stock compensation doesn\\'t do it because it\\'s\\ntoo broad,\" he said.\\n\\nmore important, rajan wants executives to be paid over a\\nfour-year period, receiving a fourth of their bonus income every\\nyear. if they make a bad bet, they won\\'t get paid the remaining\\namount.\\n\\nand rajan thinks bonuses should be based strictly on what he\\ncalls \"accounting performance,\" rather than stock performance,\\nwhich he says you can\\'t control. he also wants chief executive pay\\nto be benchmarked against the performance of rival firms. if a\\nfirms\\' earnings are worse than their rivals\\', \"why should they get\\na bonus?\" he asked.\\n\\ndespite all the criticism that hedge funds get for their\\ncompensation structures -- they charge one fee up front, and take a\\nbig cut of any profits -- rajan likes part of the hedge-fund model:\\nwhat is known as a \"high water mark.\"\\n\\nwhen hedge fund managers lose their investors\\' money, the\\nmanagers don\\'t collect any of that fat incentive fee until they\\nmake back the loss. the same rule should be applied to bankers who\\ndestroy shareholder value.\\n\\na military panel at the guantanamo naval base convicted a former\\nqaida propaganda chief of terrorism charges on monday and sentenced\\nhim to life in prison, giving the bush administration a second\\nconviction in a war-crimes trial there.\\n\\nbut the conviction of the detainee, ali hamza al bahlul, was a\\nmeasured victory for the government, which has been struggling for\\nseven years to prove the effectiveness of its military commission\\nsystem for trying terrorism suspects at the u.s. naval station at\\nguantanamo bay, cuba.\\n\\nthe guilty verdict had been expected because bahlul, a yemeni\\nwho prosecutors said was a close aide to osama bin laden, did not\\noffer any defense. saying he did not accept the authority of the\\ntribunal, he insisted that his lawyer remain mute in a weeklong\\ntrial that drew little attention.\\n\\nthe pentagon\\'s response to the verdict was muted. \"al bahlul\\nreceived a full and fair trial,\" said a spokesman, cmdr. jeffrey\\nd. gordon.\\n\\nthe conviction did not appear likely to affect the contentious\\ndebate about the use of military tribunals, said glenn m. sulmasy,\\na national security law specialist at the coast guard academy.\\n\"this was a victory for the government,\" sulmasy said, \"but it\\nmay not have positive impact because of the erosion of support and\\nlegitimacy for the commission process.\"\\n\\nbahlul was convicted of conspiracy, solicitation to commit\\nmurder, providing material support for terrorism and other charges.\\nprosecutors said he made a recruiting film, \"the destruction of\\nthe american destroyer uss cole,\" which described the 2000 attack\\nthat killed 17 sailors on the ship in the yemeni port of aden.\\n\\nthe panel of military officers deliberated for less than an hour\\non the sentence monday afternoon, after announcing its guilty\\nverdict in the morning. the only other detainee convicted after a\\nguantanamo trial, salim hamdan, a former driver for bin laden, is\\nset to complete his five-month sentence next month, after a\\nmilitary judge gave him credit for more than five years awaiting\\ntrial.\\n\\nlast year, an australian detainee, david hicks, pleaded guilty\\nto providing material support for terrorism in exchange for a\\nnine-month sentence.\\n\\nbahlul\\'s trial came after a series of new challenges to the\\npentagon\\'s prosecution efforts. last week, a military judge\\nundercut the case against another detainee, mohammed jawad, by\\nbarring the use of his confession to an attack on american\\nsoldiers. the judge ruled that it had been obtained through torture\\nby afghan officials.\\n\\njawad\\'s case has drawn wide notice because he was a teenager\\nwhen he was detained in afghanistan in 2002. his trial, scheduled\\njan. 5, is the only other war-crimes trial expected before\\npresident bush leaves office. the trial of omar khadr, a canadian\\nwho was also detained as a teenager, is scheduled for jan. 26, six\\ndays after the start of a new administration.\\n\\npentagon officials have pressed to get the commission system\\nmoving quickly, filing charges against nearly two dozen detainees\\nover the last year and expanding the staffs of military lawyers\\nprosecuting and defending the cases. but some lawyers who work on\\nthe cases say the prosecution appears uncertain because of the\\npossibility that the next president will close the guantanamo\\ndetention center and stop the trials.\\n\\neven so, pentagon officials have said they are moving ahead with\\nthe cases and anticipate bringing many of the detainees to trial.\\n\\nin recent months, several disputes have stalled cases. in\\nseptember, a prosecutor, lt. col. darrel vandeveld of the army\\nreserve, stepped down, asserting flaws in the fairness of the\\nsystem. last month, the pentagon dropped charges against five\\ndetainees whose cases vandeveld had handled. the prosecutors said\\nthey planned to file new charges.\\n\\nthe pentagon official pushing hardest to accelerate the pace of\\nthe cases, brig. gen. thomas w. hartmann, has himself been at the\\ncenter of disputes that have slowed the prosecutions. several\\ndefense lawyers filed motions seeking his disqualification,\\nclaiming he was too aligned with prosecutors.\\n\\nthree military judges agreed, disqualifying hartmann from\\nparticipation, and pentagon officials said that at least two\\nseparate investigations of his conduct were under way. a spokesman\\nfor the general declined to comment.\\n\\nthe history of the tribunals has been rocky since president bush\\nordered military commission trials in november 2001. the plan has\\nbeen stalled by court challenges and attacks from numerous military\\ncritics, including a former chief prosecutor.\\n\\nvandeveld is the latest former insider to criticize the system\\npublicly. on monday, he said from his home in pennsylvania that he\\nexpected to be called as a witness by lawyers for numerous\\ndetainees. in the meantime, he said, \"the commissions are in such\\ndisarray and continue to be in such chaos.\"\\n\\nthe diplomatic tangle between\\nvenezuela, argentina and the united states reached a new pitch on\\nmonday, when a jury in miami convicted a wealthy venezuelan\\nbusinessman of acting as an \"unregistered agent\" of venezuela on\\namerican soil.\\n\\nthe case, known in latin america as \"suitecasegate,\" started\\nlast year with the discovery of a mysterious suitcase filled with\\n$800,000 in cash at an airport here. but it has erupted into a\\nlong-running scandal that has aggravated tensions between the\\nunited states and its neighbors to the south.\\n\\nfranklin duran, the businessman convicted monday, went on trial\\nin miami for conspiring to cover up the origin and destination of\\nthe suitcase: it was a secret contribution, prosecutors said, sent\\nby venezuela\\'s government to bolster the campaign of argentina\\'s\\npresident. duran faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.\\n\\nthe case has become a symbol of the antagonism between the bush\\nadministration and president hugo chavez of venezuela, who has used\\nhis nation\\'s oil wealth to spread his influence throughout the\\nregion.\\n\\nthe scandal has also soured america\\'s relations with argentina\\nand its president, cristina fernandez de kirchner, whose legitimacy\\nhas been challenged by the revelations of secret campaign donations\\nfrom outside her country.\\n\\nboth chavez and kirchner accused the united states of political\\nmotivations in bringing the case last december, a charge officials\\nin washington and miami have repeatedly denied.\\n\\nwhether intentional or not, the eight-week trial in miami\\nrevealed an extensive cover-up effort by venezuelan officials that\\nreached the highest levels of government, and laid bare a business\\nculture in venezuela that involves regular bribes and kickbacks to\\nhigh government officials and members of the military.\\n\\nthe trial provided little in the way of evidence that american\\nnational security was somehow threatened by the presence of the\\nvenezuelans, who spent much of their time on the phone and in south\\nflorida restaurants trying to convince the man caught with the\\nsuitcase, guido alejandro antonini wilson, to keep the truth about\\nthe money under wraps.\\n\\nstill, on monday american officials sought to portray the\\ninvestigation and trial as important to safeguarding national\\nsecurity.\\n\\n\"when unregistered foreign agents believe that they can operate\\non our soil with impunity and disregard for u.s. laws, it\\nundermines the national security of our country,\" said jonathan i.\\nsolomon, the special agent in charge of the fbi\\'s miami office.\\n\\nduran reacted without emotion as the verdict was read. edward\\nshohat, his lawyer, said he would appeal the jury\\'s decision.\\n\\nshohat referred to the trial as a \"political circus in which\\nfranklin duran is a pawn of the u.s. government.\" but the lawyer\\ndeclined to comment on allegations he made in the trial\\'s early\\ndays: that the case was a politically motivated effort to embarrass\\nchavez\\'s government. \"there\\'s a lot of concern about that, but i\\'m\\nnot going into further details,\" he said.\\n\\nthe scandal surfaced in august, 2007, when an argentine\\npolicewoman here became suspicious about a suitcase being rolled\\nthrough customs by antonini wilson. the policewoman ordered him to\\nopen the case. nearly $800,000, mostly in $50 bills, spilled out.\\nargentine officials initially detained him but let him go after\\ncharging him with a simple customs infraction.\\n\\nan international scandal ensued when word soon began leaking out\\nthat the cash may have been intended for kirchner, then the leading\\ncandidate to succeed her husband, nestor kirchner, as president of\\nargentina. by that time antonini wilson was long gone, having\\nhopped a plane back to miami.\\n\\na secret cover-up followed, prosecutors said, directed from\\nvenezuela and reaching up to chavez himself, who assigned his\\nintelligence chief to try to keep antonini wilson silent, according\\nto testimony from witnesses.\\n\\nunbeknownst to the governments of venezuela and argentina,\\nantonini wilson had gone to the fbi just days after arriving back\\nin florida. he subsequently recorded hundreds of hours of\\nconversations between himself and the venezuelans.\\n\\nthree venezuelans and an uruguayan were arrested, including\\nduran, a longtime friend and business acquaintance of antonini\\nwilson. at secretly recorded meetings in florida, duran offered to\\ndeliver up to $2 million in hush money and to make sure antonini\\nwilson\\'s legal troubles in argentina went away. another suspect\\nremains at-large.\\n\\nthree of the four men who were arrested pleaded guilty to the\\nsame charges duran was convicted of, and two of them were among the\\ngovernment\\'s star witnesses.\\n\\ncarlos kauffmann, a longtime friend and business partner of\\nduran, testified that he and duran were driven to help the\\nvenezuelan government by the promise of more lucrative government\\ndeals. he said he and duran regularly paid kickbacks to venezuelan\\ngovernment agencies and state officials that netted the two men\\ntens of millions of dollars.\\n\\n\"big-time favors, sir,\" he testified, when asked what he\\nexpected to get from the venezuelan government for the effort to\\nkeep antonini wilson from talking. \"if we needed more contracts\\nfor our companies, we would make sure we were going to receive\\nthem.\"\\n\\nkauffmann also testified that the argentine and venezuelan\\ngovernments were working together to ensure that an argentine probe\\ninto the origin of the suitcase was unsuccessful.\\n\\n\"both governments had agreed to work this problem out,\"\\nkauffmann said.\\n\\nwhen antonini wilson took the stand, saying that the suitcase\\nwas not his. the money, witnesses testified, was sent by petroleos\\nde venezuela, the national oil company, which had chartered the\\nprivate aircraft. antonini wilson also testified that he was told\\nan additional $4.2 million was on the flight to argentina, and he\\nsaid there had been previous operations to smuggle in political\\ncash from venezuela to other countries in the region.\\n\\nsharna fey and kim broadbeck have gotten married\\nthree times: in 2004, they married in a daze. in 2005, they married\\non an island. and on monday, when it really counted under the law,\\nthey married in a hurry.\\n\\n\"we\\'re doing this while we still can,\" said fey, a 44-year-old\\nlife coach who has been with broadbeck for 11 years and through two\\nprevious same-sex marriage ceremonies, neither recognized as legal.\\n\"i mean, trust me: we feel married. but this is a legal\\nresponse.\"\\n\\nthey were not alone. with polls showing the outcome of a ballot\\nmeasure tuesday on outlawing same-sex marriage in california a\\ntoss-up, couples were not taking any chances on monday. they showed\\nup early here at san francisco city hall, donning boutonnieres and\\nblouses and holding each others\\' hands -- and their collective\\nbreath.\\n\\nin west hollywood, a gay friendly enclave near los angeles, john\\nduran, a city councilman, said he had performed a whopping 25\\nceremonies since friday, driving all over los angeles county to\\nofficiate.\\n\\n\"this is the modern day version of a shotgun wedding,\" said\\nduran. \"we\\'re doing as many as we can before tomorrow.\"\\n\\nthe rush to the altar was in anticipation of proposition 8,\\nwhich would amend the state constitution to define marriage as\\nbetween a man and a woman and end nearly five months of legalized\\nsame-sex marriages in the state. the ban, if approved, would take\\neffect wednesday.\\n\\n\"we\\'re here in case of what happens tomorrow,\" said michael\\nlevy, who married his partner, michael golden, in san francisco on\\nmonday, both wearing identical tuxedo jackets, ties, and beards.\\n\"i\\'m scared. it\\'s really close.\"\\n\\nsame-sex couples filled the hallway in front of the county\\nclerk\\'s office here as weddings started at 9 a.m, with more than\\n100 ceremonies scheduled throughout the day and scores more already\\nbooked for election day.\\n\\nclerks in several other california counties reported a surge in\\nthe issuance of marriage licenses, with some offices booked to\\ncapacity. san francisco expects to have performed more than 1,100\\nsame-sex ceremonies in the two weeks leading up to election day.\\n\\nelsewhere, newlyweds held ceremonies on beachfronts, backyards,\\nand living rooms.\\n\\n\"we kind of said proposition 8 was like our version of getting\\nknocked up,\" said benjamin pither, 28, who married his high-school\\nsweetheart, joseph greaves, on sunday at greaves\\' parents house in\\nsanta rosa, calif. \"we both liked the idea of marriage, but we\\nwanted to do it in our own time. but when it looked like\\nproposition 8 might pass, we realized that we would regret it if we\\ndidn\\'t take the opportunity.\"\\n\\nsome couples traveled from afar to make monday the big day.\\nallison and rose, a couple from tampa bay, fla., said they had come\\nto san francisco to marry on the advice of friends who suspect that\\nflorida will pass its own constitutional ban on same-sex marriage\\non tuesday. the couple, who said they might relocate if florida\\npasses its ban, did not want their last names used because fears\\nthat they would be discriminated against at home.\\n\\n\"it isn\\'t like san francisco,\" rose said.\\n\\nwhile defeat of the california ballot measure would probably\\nquell debate -- at least for a time -- over allowing same-sex unions\\nin the state, it is expected that a victory would lead to a\\nsecond-round of legal wrangling: this time, over the validity of\\nthe thousands marriages performed since june, when a state supreme\\ncourt decision legalizing same-sex marriages took effect.\\n\\nthe california attorney general, jerry brown, has indicated that\\nhe would uphold the marriages, but geoff kors, the executive\\ndirector of equality california, a gay rights group opposing\\nproposition 8, said he expects challenges if they lose.\\n\\n\"it wouldn\\'t surprise me that people trying to eliminate\\nconstitutional rights would try to annul or divorce people that are\\nmarried,\" said kors, who nonetheless expressed optimism that the\\nballot measure would fail.\\n\\nsupporters of the ban say no rights would be infringed by its\\npassage, but suggest the california supreme court would \"have to\\ndeal with the mess that it made\" by allowing the marriages in the\\nfirst place, said sonja eddings brown, a spokeswoman for protect\\nmarriage, the leading group behind proposition 8.\\n\\nin the spring, opponents of same-sex marriage had asked the\\ncourt to put off the marriages until the results of tuesday\\'s\\nelection were known, but the request was turned down. \"they knew\\nproposition 8 was going to be on the ballot and they decided not to\\nlisten to the voice of the people,\" brown said.\\n\\neach side has poured more than $25 million into the fight over\\nthe ballot measure, making it one of the most expensive measures\\never in a state known for its proclivities for direct democracy.\\nairwaves across the state have been blanketed in recent weeks with\\nincreasingly overheated advertisements, with opponents likening the\\nproposition to the jailing of japanese citizens during world war\\nii, and supporters suggesting that same-sex marriage will be taught\\nto young schoolchildren.\\n\\nthe most recent field poll showed a 5 point advantage for\\nopponents of the measure, but supporters of proposition 8 say\\nsame-sex marriage bans across the country have been traditionally\\nunderstated in the polls.\\n\\nin 2000, when california voters approved a law defining marriage\\nas between a man and woman, a field poll just before the election\\nshowed that 53 percent of those polled approved the measure. the\\nfinal tally in favor of the law was 61 percent.\\n\\nthe 2000 law was overturned in may by the state supreme court.\\nhundreds of joyous couples were married on balconies and atriums\\nthroughout the city\\'s soaring city hall when the court\\'s ruling\\ntook effect on june 16, 2008.\\n\\nthe mood was more subdued on monday, with bureaucracy -- \"next,\\nplease!\" -- replacing much of the ebullience of that day. fey and\\nbroadbeck, for example, seemed to almost have a touch of\\nsame-sex-marriage fatigue: the couple was among the 4,000 that\\nmarried in a happy haze in 2004 in san francisco after the city\\'s\\nmayor, gavin newsom, suddenly ordered the city clerk to marry\\nsame-sex couples.\\n\\nall those marriages were later invalidated by the courts. a year\\nlater, the couple married again in hawaii, but it was an unofficial\\nceremony in a state that does not allow same-sex marriage.\\n\\nso it was that this time around, they had almost forgotten to\\ntie the knot.\\n\\n\"all summer long we were like \\'oh yeah, we should do that,\"\\'\\nsaid fey. \"and then all of the sudden, it was like \\'uh oh.\"\\'\\n\\npaul ellis, 51, a retail manager in san francisco, was at city\\nhall on monday to witness golden and levy\\'s wedding. it was his\\nseventh same-sex marriage in the last five months, he said, most of\\nthem in the tartan kilt that he wore on a muggy monday in san\\nfrancisco, a wardrobe choice he regretted.\\n\\n\"you wouldn\\'t want to wrap six yards of cloth around your hips\\non a day like this,\" he said.\\n\\nellis had also taken matters in his own hands, getting an online\\ncertification as a marriage officiate and presiding over two\\nceremonies for other gay friends -- all ahead of tuesday\\'s election.\\n\\n\"at this point,\" he said of the ballot measure\\'s fate, \"i\\nthink it\\'s a complete crapshoot.\"\\n\\nit would be nice to think that if george bailey had been around\\nin september, the u.s. government could have saved itself $700\\nbillion, iceland could have averted near bankruptcy, and the rest\\nof the world could have avoided another trillion dollars in\\nbailouts and the prospect of a deep and long recession.\\n\\nyou recall george: in the person of james stewart, he stopped a\\nrun on the bailey brothers building &amp;amp; loan association that would\\nhave destroyed it in the film \"it\\'s a wonderful life.\" his\\npredicament, with its eerie prefigurement of the present, provokes\\na closer look at the crossroads in which culture and finance\\nintersect.\\n\\nin the film, the building &amp;amp; loan faces what is now called a\\n\"liquidity crisis\" -- the association could not possibly cover its\\nobligations with available cash, let alone guarantee any loans. the\\ntownspeople rush in demanding their life savings. \"you\\'re thinking\\nof this place all wrong,\" george tells the crowd. \"as if i had\\nthe money back in a safe. the money\\'s not here.\"\\n\\nthat much was obvious. but george goes on, pointing to\\nindividuals. \"your money\\'s in joe\\'s house,\" he says to one man.\\n\"right next to yours,\" he says to another. \"and in the kennedy\\nhouse, and mrs. backlin\\'s house, and a hundred others. why, you\\'re\\nlending them the money to build, and then, they\\'re going to pay it\\nback to you as best they can.\"\\n\\nyou think you are just depositing your money here, he suggests,\\nbut actually we\\'re all helping one another. and if some homeowners\\ncan\\'t meet their payments, \"what are you going to do,\" george\\nasks, \"foreclose on them?\"\\n\\n\"we\\'ve got to stick together,\" george says, or the truly evil\\nbanker henry potter will gain control of everything. \"we\\'ve got to\\nhave faith in each other.\"\\n\\nand, at least for a while, the pitch works. george\\'s view of the\\nsavings and loan as a form of social welfare institution was\\nlearned at the feet of his father, who built that savings and loan,\\ntelling him, \"it\\'s deep in the race for a man to want his own roof\\nand walls and fireplace. and we\\'re helping him get those things.\"\\n\\nthe baileys could almost be early incarnations of fannie mae and\\nfreddie mac -- government-created companies established to help make\\nthat same dream possible among american citizens. beginning in the\\nmid-1990s they were steadily pressured by politicians and the\\npublic to guarantee loans to ever more risky borrowers in the name\\nof this very ideal.\\n\\nwhat really helped that project along, though, was the discovery\\non wall street that such risky loans could be bundled with others\\nlike some multipack at costco and resold as highly rated\\nsecurities. it is as if george had found a way to go into business\\nwith potter, answering his scornful challenge \"are you running a\\nbusiness or a charity ward?\" with \"both!\"\\n\\nas it has turned out, of course, both george\\'s charitable dream\\nin which banks would cuddle with their communities and avoid\\nforeclosures and potter\\'s dream of profit-taking maneuverings\\nunhampered by other considerations collapsed under the unrealistic\\nweight of their fantasies a few weeks ago. but in the midst of this\\ncrisis something else has been revealed that we ordinarily\\nassociate more with cultural life than with financial enterprise.\\n\\nin the wake of foreclosures and bank failures, all circulation,\\ntrade, interaction -- the intercourse of economic life -- had nearly\\nground to a halt. even if a bank had money, it was not about to\\nrisk lending it even for short-term use by reputable businesses. it\\nis as if the entire standard of valuation had been shattered. what\\nwas anything really worth? what was dangerous and what was safe?\\nwho could be relied on?\\n\\nso debased had judgment become, and so unpredictable were the\\nconsequences, that the safest thing to do was absolutely nothing.\\nliquidity turned solid; credit froze. and this reflected a collapse\\nnot just of business activity but also of trust, or, to use\\ngeorge\\'s word, of faith.\\n\\nit might seem strange to think of these enormous disruptions as\\nreflections of something so elemental: trillions of dollars are now\\nbeing expended to re-establish trust? but we can see how this issue\\ncame up in earlier periods of cultural transition.\\n\\nconsider shakespeare\\'s \"merchant of venice.\" written at a time\\nwhen elizabethan england was being transformed by european trade\\nand its own growing international ambitions, the play can even seem\\nto be about how to create trust in a tumultuous marketplace.\\n\\nthe play lampoons cultural differences in cosmopolitan venice. a\\nbuffoonish spaniard, a scimitar-wielding moroccan, drunken germans,\\na jewish usurer -- these types are all invoked in the work. but how\\nare such varied figures to interact in \"the trade and profit of\\nthe city\"? only through the presence of a strong central law that\\nwould guarantee trust in the midst of distrust.\\n\\nshakespeare, though, does not minimize the difficulties in\\ncreating consistent methods for judging, whether assessing products\\nor the people who make them. are the goods what they seem? are\\npeople? portia\\'s suitors are forced to choose a gold, silver or\\nlead casket -- uncertain about which will disclose the true image of\\ntheir beloved. characters confuse lies and truth, ornament and\\nessence, mercy and ruthlessness. in the midst of all this it is\\namazing that any kind of social and economic interchange is\\npossible. shakespeare seems to be asserting it is, but with modern\\neyes wary of his treatment of shylock, we wonder.\\n\\non the brink of the modern economic world the issues become even\\nmore fraught. anthony trollope said that his 1875 novel, \"the way\\nwe live now,\" was \"instigated by what i conceived to be the\\ncommercial profligacy of the age.\" but that profligacy was also a\\nreflection of a social transformation: the traditional social order\\ncould no longer be counted on.\\n\\nthe hierarchy of english society ceased to be a hierarchy of\\nworth, financial or otherwise. lords with enormous estates could be\\nbroke. iou\\'s could casually be exchanged, backed by nothing but the\\nvague whiff of respectability and title. the central figure, an\\narriviste financier, creates a pyramid scheme in which railroads of\\nthe new world figure prominently. trollope sees a world of social\\ndissolution matching the financial dissolution. appearance bears no\\nrelationship to reality. by the novel\\'s end, trollope suggests the\\nonly hope for a restoration of trust is a retreat from the new\\ncommercial age.\\n\\ntrollope was not alone. in harley granville-barker\\'s 1905 play,\\n\"the voysey inheritance,\" the main tradition in a distinguished\\nfamily investment firm is the fraudulent bilking of its clients, a\\nheritage in which trust is hypocritically cultivated.\\n\\nand now, of course, the issue of trust is elevated to an\\nunprecedented scale. in 2007, when the failures of this autumn were\\nscarcely imagined, the investment analyst james grant predicted\\nthat the habits of the preceding years would lead to an imminent\\ncollapse of credit \"over which posterity will shake its head,\\nmuttering, \\'what were they thinking?\\' \"\\n\\nhe argued that the ornate nature of the financial \"products\"\\nbeing packaged was part of the problem and in an op-ed article in\\nthe new york times this past january agreed with the global bank\\nubs, which called the current mortgage crisis \"the biggest failure\\nof ratings and risk management ever.\"\\n\\nwhat is strange is that we now depend on the state to\\nre-establish trust by rescuing and even nationalizing financial\\ninstitutions, relying on the same authority that gives paper money\\nits value. but after the events of the last century, can anyone\\nfully believe that the state should be the ultimate standard for\\ntrust and fiscal faith? and would even a real-life george bailey be\\nable to coax us into confidence, let alone belief that good\\nintentions have power over principles of finance? we are in for\\nperilous times.\\n\\nas it turned out, her father had not died. marian\\nhinnant merely wanted to go to the races. and, she was not about to\\nlet the trial of sen. ted

the dow jones industrial average was virtually\\nunchanged. it declined 5.18 points, to 9,319.83. the fall was\\nsmall, but it did break a two-day winning streak for the index. the\\nbroader standard &amp;amp; poor\\'s 500-stock index lost 2.45 points, to\\n966.3, and the nasdaq composite index jumped 5.38 points, to\\n1,726.33.\\n\\nin a report that caught economists by surprise, the\\nmanufacturing index of the institute for supply management fell to\\n38.9 in october from 43.5 in september, on a scale where readings\\nbelow 50 indicate contraction in the industry. it was the lowest\\nreading since september 1982.\\n\\nthe report is a closely watched bellwether that took a steep\\nplunge last month, prompting a sell-off in the market. although the\\nindex dropped again on monday, the discouraging number registered\\nas more of the same.\\n\\nnew orders tapered off, inventories rose, and, in a worrying\\nsign for future growth, export demand fell sharply. manufacturers\\nhave been dependent on foreign orders for a constant stream of\\nrevenue. with the dollar strengthening against the euro, businesses\\nfear a sharp drop in foreign orders.\\n\\n\"in the last two months, business activity fell off a cliff,\\'\\ndaniel j. meckstroth, the chief economist of the manufacturers\\nalliance/mapi, wrote in a note. \"hurricane ike and the boeing\\nstrike

gambit.\\n\\nthey\\'ve sacrificed the queen.\\n\\nthe nuggets opened with a camby-to-clippers play, a bishop\\nsurrendered without even a rook in return. then they let pawn\\neduardo najera fall.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not a checkers move; it\\'s a chess move,\" mark\\nwarkentien, the nuggets vice president of basketball operations,\\nsaid at the time. \"chess is a tougher game to understand, and\\nyou\\'ve got to wait longer to see the results of the move.\"\\n\\nnow, the boldest move of all: allen iverson for chauncey\\nbillups.\\n\\nthe results of those chess moves will lead to victory or defeat,\\nbut not a draw. i give high praise to the answer-mr. big shot\\nexchange.\\n\\nhonestly, the time had come for a.i., to go, and the time had\\ncome for denver-native chauncey to come home. we\\'re ready for\\nanother closeup, c.b.\\n\\n\"i think we\\'ll have the most talented starting five,\" rex\\nchapman, nuggets\\' vice president of player personnel, said monday\\nafternoon, without referring to chess or checkers or other board\\ngames. \"carmelo anthony, chauncey billups, j.r. smith, kenyon\\nmartin, nene.\"\\n\\nexcept, that might not be the starting five, according to coach\\ngeorge karl, who is not a nuggets vice president, or boris spassky.\\n\\nkarl said after practice that he might start dahntay jones at\\nshooting guard, or use anthony carter in the starting lineup with\\nbillups, and he might keep bringing smith off the bench, or, or ...\\n\\nthe chess moves aren\\'t finished. antonio mcdyess will not have a\\nhomecoming with billups. although the nuggets kept talking monday\\nabout mcdyess\\' future with the team, there will be none. his\\ncontract will be bought out, and he probably will re-sign with\\ndetroit.\\n\\nhuh? he was included in the deal to make the salary numbers\\nequitable. in regard to the third guy in the deal, cheikh samb, i\\nthought i must be totally stupid because i had never heard of him,\\nbut neither had most of the nuggets, and nobody seem to know what\\ncontinent he is from.

(of course, even if\\nyou have a day job, you may have been glued to the web, in which\\ncase, take a quick break!)\\n\\nnow, a guide of highlights to watch for on tuesday:\\n\\nsetting the table: the networks are not supposed to call a state\\nuntil all the polls in that state have closed. but there will be\\nlots of raw data online, so you can go on the web, check the\\nreturns and try calling the state yourself. several news sites\\ninclude interactive maps so you can play along at home to see how\\nthe candidates might reach 270 electoral votes, the magic number\\nneeded to claim the presidency.\\n\\nand they\\'re off: the suspense starts in indiana. most polls\\nclose at 6 p.m. and others at 7 p.m. indiana is a ruby red state\\nwhere obama has been running closely with mccain. be wary of\\nresults that do not include gary, a city with a substantial\\nafrican-american population. if obama wins it, indiana could be the\\ncanary in the coal mine predicting disaster ahead for mccain.\\n\\naperitif: also at 7 p.m., polls close in virginia and georgia,\\nand polls close in most of florida and new hampshire.\\n\\nall eyes will quickly veer to virginia, which obama has labored\\nto win. if he succeeds in the former capital of the one-time\\nconfederacy, he will most likely do exceedingly well the rest of\\nthe night. subtracting virginia from the republican column would\\ngive mccain very few routes to 270 electoral votes.\\n\\nnew hampshire is less predictive. but it would be a bad sign for\\nmccain if he cannot capture these mavericks, whom he has been\\ncourting for eight years.\\n\\norange crush? florida, a voting experience unto itself. whoever\\nwins florida, the fourth-largest state, gets a big leg up on\\nwinning the presidency. again, if mccain loses here, his path\\nnarrows. but the race is so close that florida may not portend much\\nabout the rest of the country. the drama in this state, which has\\nbecome synonymous with electoral dysfunction, may be in the new and\\ncreative ways in which voters might be foiled from casting their\\nballots.\\n\\npalate cleansers: at 7:30 p.m., polls close in ohio and north\\ncarolina. while ohio is the bigger prize, keep your eyes on north\\ncarolina (where officials have the option of keeping the polls open\\nuntil 8:30 p.m. if there are problems). north carolina is a red\\nstate that is newly competitive, again thanks to an obama ground\\norganization. if north carolina votes for obama, the map is likely\\nto bleed blue for the rest of the night.\\n\\nas for ohio, it is not clear whether the adage still applies\\nthat no republican has won the presidency without carrying ohio\\nsince abraham lincoln. for an indication of how things are going,\\ncheck the returns from stark county, a longtime bellwether.\\n\\nmain course: at 8 p.m., pennsylvania and missouri finish voting.\\n\\npennsylvania, of course, is the keystone to mccain\\'s survival\\nstrategy: it is the one big blue state where he has staked his\\nclaim, in anticipation of losing some smaller red states. if he\\nwins pennsylvania, it would keep mccain alive and scramble the\\npicture for obama. and it would lead to grave pronouncements about\\nracism and the so-called bradley effect of whites not being honest\\nabout their preferences to pollsters. surveys of voters leaving the\\npolls in the april primary found that 19 percent said that race\\nplayed an important role in their decision (as they delivered the\\nstate to sen. hillary rodham clinton by nine percentage points over\\nobama).\\n\\nmissouri is another red state where the contest looks close. but\\nit frequently has voting problems that delay the count, so don\\'t\\nexpect right away to add this to one column or the other. when you\\ndo get the results, missouri is usually with the winner.\\n\\ngo west: colorado polls close at 9 p.m. this is a toss-up that\\nhas been trending democratic and is now leaning obama. if he wins\\nhere, watch for chatter of a democratic realignment. early voting\\nwas big here -- an astounding 46 percent of voters cast their\\nballots before election day.\\n\\nthe call: conventional wisdom suggests that if obama wins, he\\nwould do so early, because the polls in so many toss-up states --\\nindiana, north carolina, ohio and florida -- close early. long lines\\nor problems could delay the count. watch to see how skittish, or\\nnot, the networks are about calling the states and the final\\noutcome: cbs has signaled it might project a preliminary winner at\\n8 p.m., but all news organizations have nightmares about the\\ndebacle in 2000, when most made the wrong calls.\\n\\na two-screen night: this is the first presidential election in\\nwhich the web will be a major source of live information. this puts\\neven more pressure on the networks to remind viewers of their\\nresources and heft -- and to offer something different. check out\\nthe holograms on cnn. the networks are offering more bells and\\nwhistles this year, but they are competing with their cable\\nchannels and their own web sites as well as those of other news\\noutlets, including nytimes.com.\\n\\na note of caution: if a network calls a state, you might be able\\nto extrapolate something. but if a network does not call a state,\\ndon\\'t read too much into it. it may be that there was something\\nwrong with the exit polls (anyone remember president john kerry in\\n2004?).\\n\\nno more chads: expect some confusion at the polls. about half of\\nall voters will cast their ballots differently from the way they\\ncast them in the last presidential election; most will use paper\\nballots rather than those touchy touch-screen machines. still,\\nheavy voter participation could delay poll closings and stall the\\ncounting.\\n\\nturnout: based on early voting, analysts are predicting (there\\nthey go again) that more people will probably vote this year than\\never, in terms of numbers, and maybe at a higher rate.\\n\\nthe rate to beat in modern times is the 64 percent who voted in\\n1960. but the real record was set a century ago, when 66 percent\\nvoted in a race that no doubt warms the heart of mccain: 1908 was\\nthe year that william howard taft, the republican, defeated the\\ngolden-tongued democrat, william jennings bryan (and a real\\nsocialist, eugene v. debs).\\n\\na momentous week for washington began quietly on wall street, as\\nstocks barely budged monday amid downbeat reports on the\\nconstruction, manufacturing and auto industries.\\n\\nsales at

industrial average was virtually\\nunchanged. it declined 5.18 points, to 9,319.83. the fall was\\nsmall, but it did break a two-day winning streak for the index. the\\nbroader standard &amp;amp; poor\\'s 500-stock index lost 2.45 points, to\\n966.3, and the nasdaq composite index jumped 5.38 points, to\\n1,726.33.\\n\\nin a report that caught economists by surprise, the\\nmanufacturing index of the institute for supply management fell to\\n38.9 in october from 43.5 in september, on a scale where readings\\nbelow 50 indicate contraction. it was the lowest reading since\\nseptember 1982.\\n\\nnew orders tapered off, inventories rose, and, in a worrying\\nsign for future growth, export demand fell sharply. manufacturers\\nhave been dependent on foreign orders for a constant stream of\\nrevenue. with the dollar strengthening against the euro, businesses\\nfear a sharp drop in foreign orders.\\n\\na separate report from the commerce department showed that\\nconstruction

thousands\\nof people took to the streets of this capital city to take back an\\nelection they saw as stolen. that outpouring, called the orange\\nrevolution, brought fresh hopes for freedoms and for a release from\\nthe country\\'s soviet past that few other former republics had ever\\nexperienced.\\n\\nthe early promise of those days frayed in recent years, but\\neconomically times were good, and the country always seemed to\\nmanage.\\n\\nbut now, confronted by the global financial crisis, the new\\nukraine is facing the single biggest test of its stability, and its\\nleaders, by most accounts, seem to be at risk of failing.\\n\\nprime minister yulia v. tymoshenko and president viktor a.\\nyushchenko, former political allies, are now locked in a power\\nstruggle that has paralyzed the state, leaving it without a leader\\nat the time it most needs one.\\n\\neven as the west bends to help it, with the imf pledging an\\nemergency $16.5 billion loan last month, it barely pulled itself\\ntogether to meet the conditions for the money. yushchenko, intent\\non getting rid of tymoshenko, is trying to force early elections\\nfor december.\\n\\nukraine\\'s paralysis raises difficult questions for the west. it\\nis a country of 46 million in a strategic spot between european\\nunion countries and russia, and its stability is crucial to the\\nregion.\\n\\nyushchenko has taken a combative approach toward russia, which\\ndemonstrated a new willingness to settle disputes by force in\\ngeorgia this summer. he has pushed for ukraine to join nato, an\\nagenda that is not popular among ukrainians, 17 percent of whom are\\nethnic russians. and he has vowed not to renew a contract that\\nallows russia\\'s black sea fleet to dock in a ukrainian port.\\n\\nfor ukrainians, the fears are more about their immediate future.\\nat one point last week, their currency hit its lowest point since\\nit was introduced in 1996, and securities that insure ukrainian\\ngovernment debt

what is widely seen as a selfish struggle\\nover power.\\n\\n\"people feel let down to the point of tears,\" mostova said.\\n\"many feel they\\'ve been used. ukraine had a chance for a\\nqualitative,

dna\\nevidence that could prove their innocence.\\n\\nthe case pits the value of finality in criminal cases against\\nthe possibility of proving an inmate\\'s innocence long after trials\\nand appeals are concluded.\\n\\nin april, the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, in san\\nfrancisco, ordered prosecutors in alaska to turn over dna evidence\\nthat had been used to convict william g. osborne of kidnapping and\\nraping a prostitute. the appeals court said that biological\\nevidence -- hairs and semen -- could be subjected to more\\nsophisticated dna testing than had been used by the prosecution to\\nimplicate osborne.\\n\\nprosecutors in alaska, in their brief urging the supreme court\\nto hear the case, district attorney\\'s office v. osborne, no. 08-6,\\nsaid the appeals court had \"created from whole cloth\" a\\nconstitutional right of post-conviction access to dna evidence. the\\nprosecutors added that the court had made a separate mistake in\\nallowing a right of access to be pursued even if a conviction was\\nnot being challenged in a pending case.\\n\\nthe federal government and 44 states -- but not alaska -- have\\nlaws allowing post-conviction dna testing.\\n\\nosborne was convicted in 1994 based in part on dna evidence that\\nhad been subjected to relatively unsophisticated testing. it\\nindicated that biological evidence in the case had characteristics\\nconsistent with the profiles of 15 percent of african-american men,\\nincluding osborne. his lawyer decided not to pursue more\\ndiscriminating testing, fearing that it might further incriminate\\nhis client.\\n\\nosborne was sentenced to 26 years in prison, with five years\\nsuspended. he later confessed to the alaska board of parole but has\\nsince said he did so only in the hope of quicker release.\\n\\nthe supreme court has in earlier cases left open the question of\\nwhether people convicted after fair trials may nonetheless file\\nfederal claims based solely on evidence that they are in fact\\ninnocent.\\n\\nbarry scheck, a director of the innocence project at cardozo\\nschool of law, which represents osborne, said he could not\\nunderstand why prosecutors in alaska have opposed testing.\\n\\n\"the state of alaska concedes that dna testing could prove\\nwilliam osborne\\'s innocence, while fighting his right to testing,\"\\nscheck said. \"why would anyone be afraid to learn the truth in\\nthis case? there is no rational reason to deny dna testing that\\ncould prove innocence or confirm guilt.\"\\n\\nbiennials are a virus that has spread across the\\nglobe. embraced by cities as tourist magnets and branding tools,\\nthey often seem to be stocked by a standard jet set of curators,\\nartists, collectors and advisers who touch down, in slightly\\ndifferent configurations, at nearly every stop.\\n\\nnew orleans has joined the biennial rush with prospect.1, the\\nsprawling exhibition that opened across the city over the weekend.\\nwith a roster of nearly 80 artists, this show has an unsurprising\\nmix of good, bad and phoned-in art. but it is also a testing ground\\nwith little in the way of way of superstars, big curatorial egos\\nand elaborately produced works, and none of the vast, chilling art\\nhalls endemic in biennials.\\n\\nit proves that biennials can be just as effective when pulled\\noff without bells, whistles, big bucks and the usual suspects.\\nmaybe even more effective, especially if the local cultural soil is\\nspectacularly fertile, and if there\\'s a citywide need for uplift.\\n\\nunder these conditions something magical can happen: a merging\\nof art and city into a shifting, healing kaleidoscope. sometimes\\nthis occurs in works that are unrelated to new orleans, like the\\nglittery wall hangings el anatsui fashions from the foil of liquor\\nbottles or yasumasa morimura\\'s ranting, riveting video performance\\nas a series of 20th-century dictators.\\n\\nsometimes it occurs in site-specific works, like nari ward\\'s\\n\"diamond gym,\" a sculpture of a giant gem filled with\\nweight-lifting machines on view in the hulk of the historic battle\\nground baptist church, ruined but still standing in the lower ninth\\nward.\\n\\ndan cameron, a veteran curator and the founder of prospect.1,\\ncame to new orleans after hurricane katrina and didn\\'t want to\\nleave. he seems to have sensed that in the city\\'s rawness a\\ndifferent kind of biennial was waiting to break free. because new\\norleans lacked an obvious site for the event or the means to build\\none, cameron has distributed his selections in about 30 locations:\\nseveral museums and alternative spaces, as well as public\\nbuildings, old houses and empty lots stripped bare by the\\nhurricane.\\n\\nas a result, you are rarely viewing artworks in isolation, but\\nrather measuring them against their contexts. on one level the show\\nis a lively competition between so-called site-specific art and\\nportable art objects whose meanings are expanded by their settings.\\non another, it is a tour of the city\\'s rich past, recent trauma and\\noften struggling arts organizations. and it didn\\'t hurt that\\nprospect.1 opened the weekend before the presidential election,\\nwith everybody on pins and needles.\\n\\nagain and again, new orleans more than meets the biennial\\nhalfway. take the humbling, intoxicating beaded costumes of victor\\nharris, called \"suits,\" on view at the new orleans museum of art.\\none of several local artists who adds heft to prospect.1, harris is\\nthe big chief of the fi-yi-yi, a group of mardi gras indians, as\\nwell as a practicing shaman. profuse with hallucinatory patterns\\nand colors and evocations of african masks, his suits derail any\\nclosed definition of art or artist, as does seeing him in them, in\\naction, on video and in photographs.\\n\\nmade at the rate of one a year and unveiled during mardi gras,\\nthe suits are worn whenever the occasion demands that harris call\\nforth a spirit he has named fi-yi-yi. the garments leave no doubt\\nabout the high levels of creativity in a city where french, french\\ncanadian, african and american indian cultures have mixed for\\ncenturies.\\n\\nin one of the most haunting matchups of art and site, works by\\nrico gatson, william kentridge and the duo bradley mccallum and\\njacqueline tarry have been installed at the new orleans african\\namerican museum, a beautiful creole house on governor nicholls\\nstreet. working in drawing, photography and animation, the artists\\nexplore often painful moments of racial violence, from world war i\\nto the civil rights era to the rolling stones\\' altamont concert.\\n\\nsome site-specific efforts are simply based on received ideas.\\ntakashi horisaki\\'s latex cast of a house wrecked by the storm, on\\nview at the hefler warehouse on magazine street, is inhabited less\\nby the ghosts of katrina than by robert overby and rachel\\nwhiteread\\'s casts of domestic architecture.\\n\\nsebastian preece\\'s work is more effective, even if it borders on\\nurban archaeology. he has taken the concrete slabs and footings\\nfrom a house in the lower ninth ward lost to the hurricane, sliced\\nthem up and displayed them, bottom side up, on the water-damaged\\nlower floor of the tekrema center for art and culture. some\\nresemble topographical maps, others abstract sculptures. on the\\nundamaged second floor the new york painter adam cvijanovic has\\npainted the walls with lavish, slightly oppressive vistas of\\nlouisiana swamps, exaggerating the traditions of wallpaper and\\nmural painting to suggest that nature is ever invasive and always\\ncapable of eradicating any human effort.\\n\\nseeing mark bradford\\'s enormous \"noah\\'s ark\" provides a\\nfirsthand experience of the eradication in the lower ninth ward,\\nwhere nothing remains of many houses except lonely stoops and empty\\nlots. made of old pieces of poster-plastered plywood, the ark rises\\nfrom one of these lots, forlorn yet indomitable. its ancient hulk,\\nwith its cacophony of decaying advertisements, seems to ridicule\\nthe overwrought, seemingly marooned houses commissioned by the\\nactor brad pitt that dot the neighborhood.\\n\\nsometimes, touring the show, you can see hints of the city\\'s\\npossible comeback. to reach the big, vampy photos by the french\\nartists pierre et gilles in a building that was a furniture store\\nbefore the hurricane, you must walk through a lively exhibition of\\nwork by local artists -- one of several shows piggybacking on\\nprospect.1 -- as well as the front desk of a police precinct.\\n\\nthere are some unfortunate miscalculations. the talented\\nkatharina grosse has sprayed orange and yellow paint all over the\\nfacade and front yard of a dilapidated house in the lower ninth. it\\nmay be intended to symbolize the fire next time, but it seems to\\nhumiliate one of the storm\\'s survivors.\\n\\nthe effect is more organic in a double-screen video by the\\nbrazilian artist rosangela renno, which can be seen in the french\\nquarter in a house recently acquired by the historic new orleans\\ncollection, a museum and research society. the video shows older\\nmen and women, black and white, from the new orleans area\\nostensibly discussing cajun cooking. the real subject is the bonds\\nand boundaries among the races in new orleans, as well as a\\npotential loss of identity should the cajun language and customs\\nwither away.\\n\\nseveral works pull back to show the larger picture, reminding us\\nthat the tragedy of hurricane katrina is not unique. these include\\nmarcel odenbach\\'s video meditation on the rwandan massacres and\\nfiona tan\\'s on the vulnerable flood plains of the netherlands; both\\nworks are being screened at the contemporary arts center. at the\\nnew orleans center for creative arts, a high school, the bulgarian\\nartist nedko solakov has covered the walls of one classroom with a\\ntragicomedy, mostly handwritten, suggesting that both hurricane\\nkatrina and a deadly flood in bulgaria resulted from the wrath of\\nthe competing ghosts of two 13th-century bulgarian kings.\\n\\nsite-specific in the national, temporal sense is an elaborate,\\nviciously on-target installation by stephen g. rhodes depicting a\\nmessy, deserted campaign headquarters post-election. strewn with\\nballoons, voting machines, ballots and doctored videos of the robot\\nfigures that play the american presidents at disney world, it only\\nintensified the pins-and-needles atmosphere of the opening weekend.\\nprospect.1 will remain on view until jan. 18, two days before the\\nnew president takes office.\\n\\nthe final full day of campaigning was a blur of rallies, plane\\nrides and meet-and-greet encounters for the candidates, and at\\nevery step of the way four new york times reporters were there to\\nchronicle the hectic final push. the following are dispatches from\\nelisabeth bumiller on the mccain campaign, jeff zeleny on the obama\\ncampaign, john broder on the biden campaign, and julie bosman on\\nthe palin campaign.\\n\\n8:40 a.m.\\n\\nsen. barack obama leaves his hotel in jacksonville, fla., where\\nhe had arrived seven hours before after a late-night flight from\\nohio. as he went to the gym for a morning workout, he did not say\\nanything at the time, but he had received word around 8 a.m. that\\nhis grandmother, madelyn dunham, had died after a battle with\\ncancer. he later called dunham \"a quiet hero\" for her central\\nrole in raising him.\\n\\n9:30 a.m.\\n\\nwell, here we are in tampa, fla., at sen. john mccain\\'s first\\nstop on a seven-state, 20-hour odyssey across america. he is\\nalready running a half hour late. not a good sign. \"hurry up!\\nhurry up!\" yell secret service agents at reporters scurrying from\\nthe campaign plane into the waiting motorcade.\\n\\nwithin minutes, mccain arrives at his rally at raymond james\\nstadium, the home of the tampa bay buccaneers and a barack\\nobama-sized site with a 65,000-person capacity. mccain is not\\nactually in the stadium, which sits empty on a warm florida\\nmorning, but across the street in the parking lot. the crowd here\\nis small, in the hundreds, but mccain is launching into his stump\\nspeech as if he were addressing the rose bowl, although with a bit\\nof sleep in his voice. he got to his hotel in coral gables, the\\nbiltmore, at 1:30 a.m., after a midnight rally in miami.\\n\\n\"with this kind of enthusiasm, this kind of intensity, we will\\nwin florida!\" he shouts. he seems to be waking up. gov. charlie\\ncrist of florida is here, as is sen. mel martinez, also of florida.\\n\\nmccain runs through a truncated version of his stump speech.\\nobama cannot be trusted to run the country, he will raise your\\ntaxes, kill jobs, and so on.\\n\\nwow, now he is already winding up. \"fight for a new direction\\nfor our country!\" and \"fight to clean up the mess of\\ncorruption!\"\\n\\nhe is already done. his speech clocked in at a little more than\\n13 minutes. this might be a record.\\n\\n11:03 a.m.\\n\\nsen. claire mccaskill of missouri steps to the microphone to\\nintroduce sen. joe biden in lees summit, mo., and notes that the\\nrepublican vice-presidential nominee, gov. sarah palin of alaska,\\nis also in missouri this morning, at a rally in jefferson city.\\n\\nthe crowd boos. mccaskill hushes them. \"as barack obama says,\\n\\'don\\'t boo. vote.\"\\'\\n\\nmccaskill then adds, speaking of biden, \"barack obama chose the\\nvery best person in the country who could be president of the\\nunited states, and, well, let\\'s just say, john mccain didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n11:15 a.m.\\n\\nfor more than three hours, supporters have been filling the\\nseats of the hall in anticipation of obama\\'s visit to veteran\\'s\\nmemorial auditorium in jacksonville, fla., not far from the banks\\nof the st. johns river. then the candidate arrives.\\n\\n\"i have just one word for you, florida: tomorrow,\" obama said,\\ndrawing huge bursts of applause. \"we are one day away from\\nchanging the united states of america.\"\\n\\nwith mccain already well into his day, was obama sleeping in\\nthis morning? no, his aides say.\\n\\nafter arriving at the hyatt in downtown jacksonville in the\\nearly morning hours, he emerged from the hotel at 8:40 a.m. -- yes,\\nthat was the democratic nominee in a ball cap and black sweat pants\\n-- and took a short ride to a gold\\'s gym. for 45 minutes, he worked\\nout.\\n\\nwhen he returned to the hotel at 9:28 a.m., he went into\\nseclusion. aides said he had breakfast, made phone calls and met\\nwith a few advisers who were briefing him on his day, which\\nincludes rallies in jacksonville, in north carolina and in\\nvirginia.\\n\\nwhy only three states for obama, when mccain is racing to seven\\nover the next 20 hours? first, aides said, the obama rallies are\\nheld in large arenas, not airport hangars, so they take more time.\\nand second, they said, the rallies are intended to sign up\\nsupporters to help on election day, so it is important to have a\\nbig crowd, rather than just a quick stop for the local cameras.\\n\\n11:26 a.m.\\n\\nyes, obama is using a teleprompter for his speech in\\njacksonville, but apparently he is not reading it carefully. about\\n10 minutes into his address, obama was talking about the television\\ncommercials that republicans have been showing against him.\\n\\n\"here in ohio,\" obama began. he paused momentarily, as people\\nin the crowd shouted at him. realizing his mistake, he quickly\\ncorrected himself. \"florida!\"\\n\\n\"i\\'ve been traveling too much,\" obama said, before continuing\\nwith his remarks.\\n\\n11:50 a.m.\\n\\nstop no. 2 for mccain, still some 20 minutes behind schedule.\\ntennessee\\'s electoral votes are not up for grabs in this reliably\\nred state, but mccain has descended into blountsville in this far\\nnortheastern corner to reach into television markets in\\nsouthwestern virginia and a bit of north carolina, two states he\\ndesperately needs to win.\\n\\nwe are in an airplane hangar and the crowd is roaring and big,\\nin the thousands. mccain\\'s campaign plane is parked right behind\\nhim as a backdrop for all the television pictures. the day is\\ngorgeous, sunny and crisp. the loudspeakers are terrible.\\n\\n\"this microphone is brought to you by the democratic national\\ncommittee,\" mccain intones, to laughter.\\n\\nand here he is, joe the plumber. big boos from the crowd as\\nmccain says, yet again, that obama wants to \"spread the wealth\\naround.\" and \"he\\'s in the far left lane of american politics.\"\\nand he has never taken on the leaders of his own party. and he said\\nhe would sit down unconditionally with dictators. and so on. mccain\\nis pumped up.\\n\\n\"the mac is back!\" he shouts.\\n\\non the plane from tampa, somebody asked mark salter, mccain\\'s\\nclose adviser, how he planned to get through the day. \"crystal\\nmeth,\" he replied, not missing a beat. \"me, personally, that\\'s\\nhow i\\'m going to do it.\"\\n\\nhe was kidding. but he did not even to bother to say he was off\\nthe record.\\n\\n12:36 p.m.\\n\\nthe palin entourage just arrived in jefferson city, right in the\\ncenter of missouri. we are at a rally staged on the steps of the\\nstate capitol, on a dazzling, sunny 70-degree afternoon. as the\\nreporters are ushered to their workspace, a few people in the crowd\\nthrow out a few stray heckles. \"come on, reporters, why don\\'t you\\ndo a good job for once!\" an elderly woman called out. \"booo,\\nliberals!\" another man shouted.\\n\\nthere is a large crowd here, but nowhere near the estimate of\\n20,000 people that a campaign staff member just told reporters.\\nthere is little sign of mccain -- most of the signs say \"country\\nfirst\" or \"reform, prosperity, peace.\" a group of women wearing\\nt-shirts that say \"sometimes it takes a woman to clean house\" are\\nchanting \"sarah! sarah!\" and the song \"everyday people,\" by sly\\nand the family stone,\" a palin favorite, is playing.\\n\\nsounding hoarse, palin introduces hank williams jr., who\\ndelivers an off-key rendition of the national anthem and a song\\nabout the \"left-wing liberal media,\" which makes the crowd go\\nwild.\\n\\npalin delivers a 25-minute speech, attacking obama for his tax\\nproposals, and making a passing reference to the weather. \"the sun\\nis shining on his plans for where he wants to take america,\" she\\nsaid of obama. \"his whole tax plan is so phony that it\\'s already\\nstarting to unravel.\"\\n\\nshe pointed out a sign in the crowd: \"like that sign -- not just\\ndrill, baby, drill and mine, baby, mine, but vote, baby, vote!\"\\n\\n1:50 p.m.\\n\\nstop no. 3 mccain, in moon township, pa. this is one of the\\ngreat datelines. in fact it is very much of this world -- the site\\nof the pittsburgh airport and conveniently located in western\\npennsylvania, home to all those pro-gun, working-class voters that\\nmccain is trying to call his own. rep. john p. murtha, a democrat\\nwho represents the region, went so far last month as to call it a\\n\"racist area,\" a remark the mccain campaign rejected.\\n\\nwe are in another airplane hangar, crowd not so big as before.\\nmccain just started speaking and already he is shouting that it is\\ntime \"to fight to get out economy out of the ditch.\" that\\'s our\\ncue, time to go. he has got this aerobic speechifying down pat.\\n\\nforgot to mention that at the last stop he brought up tina fey\\'s\\nimpersonation of his running mate, palin, on \"saturday night\\nlive.\" mccain was on the show himself on saturday and met fey.\\n\\n\"i really believe that sarah palin and tina fey were separated\\nat birth, i really do,\" mccain told the last crowd. \"i really\\ndo.\"\\n\\n2:30 p.m.\\n\\nobama hustled up the stairs to his campaign plane, boarding a\\n53-minute flight for charlotte, n.c. since his rally ended more\\nthan two hours ago, obama has conducted a series of radio\\ninterviews, including one with ann compton of abc news.\\n\\nhere are highlights:\\n\\ncompton: best moment of campaign?\\n\\nobama: \"the iowa caucus night was, was wonderful.\"\\n\\ncompton: was there a worst moment? or what keeps you up at\\nnight?\\n\\nobama: \"the night we lost new hampshire was tough. we had been\\n10 points up according to the polls going into election day and\\nlost by 2, and that\\'s one of the reasons why we take nothing for\\ngranted in this race and we don\\'t believe those polls.\"\\n\\n3:01 p.m.\\n\\nbiden, ordinarily the most superstitious of politicians, can\\nsmell victory.\\n\\n\"there\\'s something in the air, guys,\" he told a gaggle of\\nreporters on his plane shortly before landing in columbus, ohio,\\nfor the first of two appearances in the state this afternoon.\\n\\nyou can see the confidence in biden\\'s smile and his new\\naccessibility to the reporters who have accompanied him for two\\nmonths. he spoke to them for 20 minutes on his plane, the first\\ntime he has done so since early september. he said he had been\\navoiding his press pack since one news organization reported some\\ncomments he thought were off the record.\\n\\n3:55 p.m.\\n\\nstop no. 4 for mccain, the indianapolis airport. the tarmac is\\nsunny and pleasant; beautiful golden late-afternoon light. but\\nmccain\\'s presence here on the eve of election day means he is still\\nbattling obama\\'s incursions into this longtime red state. not great\\nnews for him, but polls show him tied.\\n\\nadding to the troubles, there is something wrong with the\\nspeaker system. again? he repeats his dig about the microphone\\nbeing \"brought to you courtesy of the democratic national\\ncommittee.\"\\n\\nhe is hard to hear, and on top of that, he is beginning to sound\\nlike he has a large frog in his throat. a big portion of mccain\\'s\\ncampaign plane has a spectacular cold, and it sounds like the\\ncandidate has caught it himself.\\n\\n\"he\\'s getting a little scratchy,\" salter said. \"only has to\\ndo it three more times today.\"\\n\\n4:15 p.m.\\n\\nobama steps off his plane in charlotte without talking to\\nreporters.\\n\\n4:30 p.m.\\n\\nobama announces through a statement that his grandmother died\\nabout 12 hours earlier. he waited to make the public announcement,\\nhis aides said, to get through a portion of his campaign day.\\n\\n5 p.m.\\n\\nobama tossed a tiny red and blue football into the air as he\\nmade calls to north carolina voters. on the fifth call, he turned\\nhis back to cameras as he talked about home health care, saying:\\n\"my grandmother was able to stay in a home all the way until\\nrecently.\"\\n\\n5:48 p.m. (mountain time)\\n\\nstop no. 5 for the mccain campaign, roswell, n.m. we are here in\\nthe supposed land of space aliens on warm a desert night. another\\nairport rally, another rendition of the speech.\\n\\n\"we need to win new mexico tomorrow!\" mccain hollers. \"get\\nyour neighbors to the polls. i need your vote!\"\\n\\nnow here is something really different: out of the blue, mccain\\nshouts out: \"i am pleased to announce that i have received the\\nalien endorsement!\"\\n\\nthis gets a huge laugh. there are two more stops to go.\\n\\nthe 2008 race for the white house that comes to an end on\\ntuesday fundamentally upended the way presidential campaigns are\\nfought in america, a legacy that has almost been lost with all the\\nattention being paid to the battle between john mccain and barack\\nobama.\\n\\nit has rewritten the rules on how to reach voters, raise money,\\norganize supporters, manage the news media, track and mold public\\nopinion, and wage -- and withstand -- political attacks, including\\nmany carried by blogs that did not exist four years ago. it has\\nchallenged the consensus view of the american electoral\\nbattleground, suggesting that democrats can at a minimum be\\ncompetitive in states and regions that had long been republican\\nstrongholds.\\n\\nthe size and makeup of the electorate may be changed because of\\ndemocratic efforts to register and turn out new african-american,\\nhispanic and young voters. this shift could have long-lasting\\nramifications for what both parties do to build enduring\\ncoalitions, especially if intensive and technologically driven\\nvoter turnout programs succeed in getting more people registered\\nand to the polls.\\n\\nefforts by democrats to win the allegiance of demographic groups\\nlike african-americans, hispanics and young people could have\\nlong-lasting ramifications for what both parties do to build\\nenduring coalitions, especially if intensive and technologically\\ndriven voter turnout programs succeed in getting more people\\nregistered and to the polls.\\n\\n\"i think we\\'ll be analyzing this election for years as a\\nseminal, transformative race,\" said mark mckinnon, a senior\\nadviser to president bush\\'s campaigns in 2000 and 2004. \"the year\\ncampaigns leveraged the internet in ways never imagined. the year\\nwe went to warp speed. the year the paradigm got turned upside down\\nand truly became bottom up instead of top down.\"\\n\\nto a considerable extent, republicans and democrats say, this is\\na result of the way that the obama campaign sought to understand\\nand harness the internet (and other forms of so-called new media)\\nto organize supporters and to reach voters who no longer rely\\nprimarily on information from newspapers and television. the\\nplatforms ranged from youtube, which did not exist in 2004, to the\\ncell phone text messages that the campaign was sending out to\\nsupporters on monday to remind them to vote.\\n\\n\"we did some very innovative things on the data side, and we\\ndid some internet,\" said sara taylor, who was the white house\\npolitical director during bush\\'s re-election campaign. \"but only\\n40 percent of the country had broadband back then. you now have\\npeople who don\\'t have home telephones anymore. and obama has done a\\ntremendous job of waging a campaign through the new media\\nchallenge. i don\\'t know about you, but i see an obama internet ad\\nevery day. and i have for six months.\"\\n\\neven more crucial to the way this campaign has transformed\\npolitics has been obama\\'s success at using the internet to build a\\nhuge network of contributors that permitted him to raise enough\\nmoney -- after declining to participate in the public financing\\nsystem -- to expand the map and compete in traditionally republican\\nstates.\\n\\nno matter who wins, republicans and democrats say, obama\\'s\\nefforts in places like indiana, north carolina and virginia --\\norganizing and advertising to voters who previously had little\\nexposure to democratic ideas and candidates -- will force future\\ncandidates to think differently.\\n\\n\"the great impact that this election will have for the future\\nis that it killed public financing for all time,\" said mccain\\'s\\nchief campaign strategist, steve schmidt. \"that means the next\\nrepublican presidential campaign, hopefully a re-election for john\\nmccain, will need to be a billion-dollar affair to challenge what\\nthe democrats have accomplished with the use of the internet and\\nviral marketing to communicate and raise money.\"\\n\\n\"it was a profound leap forward technologically,\" schmidt\\nadded. \"republicans will have to figure out how to compete with\\nthis in order to become competitive again at a national level and\\nin house and senate races.\"\\n\\nthis transformation did not happen this year alone. in 2000,\\nbush\\'s campaign, lead by karl rove and ken mehlman, pioneered the\\nuse of micro-targeting to find and appeal to potential new\\nsupporters. in 2004, the presidential campaign of howard dean was\\nwidely credited with being the first to see the potential power of\\nthe internet to raise money and sign up volunteers, a platform that\\nobama tremendously expanded.\\n\\n\"they were apollo 11, and we were the wright brothers,\" said\\njoe trippi, the manager of dean\\'s campaign.\\n\\nterry nelson, political director of the bush campaign in 2004,\\nsaid that the evolution was challenging campaign operatives who\\nworked for every presidential campaign, and would continue in 2012\\nand beyond.\\n\\n\"we are in the midst of a fundamental transformation of how\\ncampaigns are run,\" nelson said. \"and it\\'s not over yet.\"\\n\\nthe changes go beyond what obama did and reflect a cultural\\nshift in voters, producing an audience that is at once better\\ninformed, more skeptical and, from reading blogs, sometimes\\ntrafficking in rumors or suspect information. as a result, this new\\nelectorate tends to be more questioning of what they are told by\\ncampaigns and often uses the web to do their own fact-checking.\\n\\n\"you do focus groups and people say, \\'i saw that ad and i went\\nto this web site to check it,\\' \" said david plouffe, the obama\\ncampaign manager. \"they are policing the campaigns.\"\\n\\nschmidt said the speed and diversity of the news cycle had\\nbroken down the traditional way that voters received information\\nand had given campaigns opportunities, and challenges, in trying to\\nmanage the news.\\n\\n\"the news cycle is hyper-accelerated and driven by new players\\non the landscape, like politico and huffington post, which cause\\ncompetition for organizations like the ap where there is a high\\npremium on being first,\" he said. \"this hyper-accelerates a cable\\nnews cycle driven to conflict and drama and trivia.\"\\n\\namong the biggest changes this year is the intense new interest\\nin politics, reflected in jumps in voter registration numbers,\\nearly voting and attendance at obama\\'s rallies. to no small extent,\\nthat is a reflection of the unusual interest stirred by his\\ncampaign. thus, it is hardly clear that a future candidate who\\nappropriated all the innovations that obama and his campaign tried\\nwould necessarily have the same success as obama.\\n\\n\"without the candidate who excites people,\" plouffe said,\\n\"you can have the greatest strategy and machinery and it won\\'t\\nmatter.\"\\n\\ntrippi, who worked for one of obama\\'s rivals in the democratic\\nprimary campaign, john edwards, said: \"it has all come together\\nfor one guy, barack obama. but now that it\\'s happened, it\\'s a\\npermanent change.\"\\n\\na campaign waged under the specter of war\\nand financial crisis drew to an anxious finish on monday as sens.\\nbarack obama and john mccain raced across nine states and asked\\nvoters on both sides to discount polls and predictions on the\\nclosing day of a two-year pursuit of the presidency.\\n\\nobama surrendered the race to the judgment of the american\\npeople as he told a booming crowd here, \"now, it\\'s all about who\\nwants it more, who believes in it more.\" mccain sought to motivate\\nrepublicans who worried aloud that it could be a bleak election,\\ndeclaring, \"the mac is back!\"\\n\\nin the final hours of his second bid for the presidency, mccain\\ndashed through republican-leaning states from florida to indiana\\nand new

for a rally in arizona in the small hours of the night.\\n\\nobama, confident in his standing on democratic terrain, devoted\\nhis final day of campaigning by trying to push florida, north\\ncarolina and virginia into his column. he pressed ahead after he\\nawoke to news that his grandmother, the woman chiefly responsible\\nfor his upbringing, had died overnight in hawaii.\\n\\nthe election eve travels of both men, as well as their running\\nmates, offered a viewer\\'s guide of the states whose outcomes will\\nloom large in settling who will become the nation\\'s 44th president\\nafter the polls close on tuesday.\\n\\nthe candidates\\' last-minute efforts were amplified by their\\nmuscular ground organizations and unprecedented advertising\\nbarrages across all modes of technology. the obama campaign tested\\nits text messaging program to remind voters, particularly young\\nones, to go to the polls. the mccain campaign activated its\\nautomated phone system to check in with any voter who has shown an\\ninterest in the republican ticket.\\n\\nin their pitches to voters, both candidates struck optimistic\\nchords, delivering a few gracious words about their opponent and\\noffering their own pledges to change washington. yet neither man\\nrefrained from reprising the piercing criticisms that have become\\nthe soundtrack for the five-month general election fight.\\n\\n\"at the end of this long race, i want to congratulate him on\\nthe tough race that he has fought,\" obama said, speaking of mccain\\nduring a morning speech here at veterans memorial auditorium. \"he\\ncan point to a few items where he has broke with president bush,\\nbut when it comes from the central issue of this election, the\\nplain truth is john mccain has stood with george bush.\"\\n\\nmccain delivered a truncated version of his stump speech at each\\nstop but grew hoarser as the day progressed. his staff said he\\nappeared to be catching the bad cold that had waylaid many\\npassengers in his campaign plane. by late afternoon in indiana, he\\nwas using throat lozenges to try to get through the rest of the\\nmarathon.\\n\\n\"my friends, you know that i\\'ve been fighting for this country\\nsince i was 17 years old and i have the scars to prove it!\" he\\ntold a rally in indianapolis as he battled to prevent obama from\\ntaking a state that has not backed a democratic presidential\\ncandidate since 1964.\\n\\nfour hours later, mccain dropped into the supposed home of space\\naliens, roswell, n.m. \"i am pleased to announce that i have\\nreceived the alien endorsement,\" he told the crowd, to an uproar\\nof laughter.\\n\\nas the contest headed to its finish, an air of normality\\nsurrounded obama. there was no rush of friends or advisers on the\\nplane for the final flights. his demeanor, at least from his public\\nappearances, seemed the same as it has for months. his schedule of\\nrallies was no more aggressive, or different, than at any point in\\nthe general election.\\n\\nonly a few close advisers knew that at 8 a.m. he had received\\nword from his sister that his 86-year-old grandmother, madelyn\\ndunham, had died. when he arrived at a rally, he spoke briefly\\nabout the woman whom he visited late last month in honolulu during\\na brief suspension of his campaign.\\n\\n\"she has gone home,\" obama said, his voice tinged with\\nemotion. \"she died peacefully in her sleep with my sister at her\\nside, so there\\'s great joy instead of tears.\"\\n\\nmccain, as he sprinted through seven states, warned voters at\\nevery stop of the differences between the outlooks and policies of\\nthe republican and democratic tickets. he didn\\'t dally, spending 30\\nminutes at each stop, with his argument boiled down to fit the\\nfrenzied moment.\\n\\n\"sen. obama\\'s running to punish the successful,\" mccain said\\nat his opening stop in tampa. \"i\\'m running to make everyone\\nsuccessful.\"\\n\\nat each stop, the drill for mccain was nearly the same: he raced\\nout of his plane, walked a few steps to an airport hangar, told the\\ncrowd he had to win florida, virginia and pennsylvania and\\ndelivered a truncated version of his speech.\\n\\nthe mood on the mccain campaign plane was upbeat and punchy\\nthroughout the day as mccain\\'s advisers continued to hammer their\\nbelief that the polls were tightening and that mccain\\'s chances of\\nwinning the presidency were difficult but not impossible. \"winning\\n270 is right in the cards,\" mccain\\'s campaign manager, rick davis,\\ninsisted to reporters around midnight on sunday, as mccain\\'s plane\\nheaded from new hampshire to florida.\\n\\nmccain drew stirring applause from his crowds -- as well as jeers\\ndirected at the democratic rival -- when he said obama wanted to\\n\"spread the wealth around.\"\\n\\n\"he\\'s in the far left lane of american politics,\" mccain said.\\n\\nthe barnstorming rallies, the dawn-to-dusk television\\ncommercials and the armies of volunteers flooding those\\nneighborhoods belied the reality of how america elects its\\npresident: with millions of ballots have already cast though early\\nvoting.\\n\\nin ohio, voting lines looped in and out of doors, upstairs and\\naround corners at the registrar\\'s office in columbus, with a record\\nnumber of voters adding their ballots to those that have been\\ncollected for nearly a month. early signs point skyward for the\\ndemocrats, who outnumbered republicans by more than two to one.\\n\\nin florida, about 37 percent of registered voters have already\\ncast their ballots, state officials said, setting the stage for\\npotentially record-breaking turnout.\\n\\nin virginia, where more restrictions are placed on early voting,\\nthe state has processed 465,962 absentee ballots. and more than\\n300,000 virginians voted in person by an absentee ballot. that\\ncontrasts with the 2004 total of 222,059 absentee ballots cast.\\n\\nworried about the outlook in virginia, where a democrat hasn\\'t\\nwon the presidential race in more than four decades, mccain\\'s\\ncampaign sued the state\\'s election board on monday. they asserted\\nthat the absentee ballots weren\\'t mailed on time to military\\nmembers serving overseas.\\n\\nobama selected virginia as the site of his final rally, a sign\\ndemocrats are waging an all-out push for the state that is seen as\\na barometer for the fight with mccain. in virginia and around the\\ncountry, both sides are keeping a close eye on the weather\\nconditions for election

members of parliament not to impeach\\nhim.\\n\\nmembers of parliament had questioned the qualifications of the\\nofficial, interior minister ali kordan, when president mahmoud\\nahmadinejad nominated him for the post in august. the previous\\nminister had been dismissed because of his differences with the\\npresident.\\n\\nkordan claimed to have been awarded an honorary doctorate from\\noxford university. but a parliamentary investigation found not only\\nthat kordan\\'s ph.d. was a fake, but also that he had neither the\\nbachelor\\'s nor master\\'s degrees he had claimed from an iranian\\nuniversity.\\n\\nthe scandal over his impeachment turned into a crisis on\\nwednesday when a government official, muhammad abbassi, distributed\\n$5,000 checks among parliamentary ministers who had signed the\\nimpeachment motion. the weekly news magazine shahrvand emrooz\\nreported that abbassi gave the checks as a donation for the\\nlegislators\\' local mosques, but asked them to sign two receipts.\\none of those receipts was for a letter to the speaker of parliament\\nasking for the impeachment to be dropped. ali asghar zarei, a\\nlegislator close to ahmadinejad, slapped abbassi in the face, and\\nthe speaker expelled the official from parliament. later, abbassi\\nwas dismissed by ahmadinejad, who said he would not bother to\\nappear in parliament to defend his minister.\\n\\n\"who cares even if kordan\\'s degree is fake?\" the islamic\\nrepublic news agency quoted ahmadinejad as asking. \"i have already\\nsaid that it is just a torn piece of paper because it was only an\\nhonorary degree.\"\\n\\nahmadinejad said he did not consider the impeachment legal\\nbecause kordan had done nothing wrong. kordan refused to resign\\ndespite calls by legislators.\\n\\nanalysts believe that the impeachment would undermine\\nahmadinejad\\'s standing in the coming presidential elections in june\\n2009.\\n\\nthis sweltering amazon outpost is a border\\ntown on the move -- on two motorized wheels, that is.\\n\\nduring the afternoon rush hour, tabatinga\\'s main avenue is a sea\\nof scooters and motorcycles. whole families pile onto a single\\nscooter, even families of five: husband, wife and three children.\\nmothers breastfeed infants while fathers navigate a road nearly\\nuncluttered by traffic signals.\\n\\nwith more than 15,000 motorbikes and only 47,000 people,\\ntabatinga resembles a small version of ho chi minh city, vietnam,\\nanother chaotic place where cars take a distant back seat as the\\npreferred mode of transportation.\\n\\n\"i have never seen a place with so many motorbikes,\" said\\nsabrina d\\'assumpcao, a resident of rio de janeiro who was visiting\\nher husband, a military officer, at the army base here recently.\\n\"it is practically a city run entirely by motorbikes.\"\\n\\ntabatinga owes much of its moto-obsession to its location along\\nbrazil\\'s extreme western frontier. nestled alongside colombia and\\njust across a narrow river from peru, the town has evolved in the\\nlast quarter century from a military town into a hub of\\ncross-border commerce.\\n\\nthe open border with leticia, colombia, allows brazilians to buy\\njapanese-made motorbikes there for about $2,000, half of what they\\ncost in brazil. chinese-made models, which are less popular with\\nresidents, can be had for as little as $900 on the river island of\\nsanta rosa, in peru, said ulianov mejia, the manager of the yamaha\\nmotorbike store in tabatinga.\\n\\n\"here you can have breakfast in brazil, lunch in colombia and\\ndinner in peru because it\\'s a triple border,\" said mejia, a\\ncolombian who is married to a brazilian woman and has been living\\nhere since 2001.\\n\\nin recent years the relative strength of the brazilian economy\\nand its currency, the real, has made it easier for brazilians to\\nafford motorbikes. easy credit terms allow people to pay in up to\\n24 installments, and most people walk out of a store with a bike\\nafter putting down just 30 percent, mejia said. for some, it can be\\neven easier than that.\\n\\n\"if a fisherman from the river doesn\\'t have documents, doesn\\'t\\nhave a checking account, but if i know him, know where he lives,\\nknow his family, i will sell to him without a problem,\" mejia\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe ease of acquiring a motorbike has helped fuel the growth of\\nthe city, which has doubled in population in the past 20 years,\\nsurging past neighboring leticia, which has about 35,000 residents\\nand about 10,000 motorbikes.\\n\\n\"there are families that have six or seven motorbikes,\" said\\njoel santos de lima, tabatinga\\'s mayor. \"they are cheap and easy\\nto buy, and they help keep the economy moving.\"\\n\\nfor those who cannot afford their own motorbikes, tabatinga\\nboasts 500 two-wheeled moto taxis run by four companies. for one\\nand a half reals, about 70 cents, a moto taxi will take you\\nanywhere in the city.\\n\\nthe drivers are the model of efficiency and reliability, said\\nwaldery nobre mesquita, a doctor who uses them daily to see\\npatients. by law the moto taxis are allowed to carry only one\\npassenger, said anderson de souza, tabatinga\\'s public\\ntransportation coordinator.\\n\\nbut that seems to be where the rules stop and the lawlessness\\nbegins. tabatinga does not require motorbikes to be registered or\\nresidents to wear helmets. the process of applying for a license\\nplate and insuring a motorbike is laden with bureaucracy, and costs\\nabout $500, more than most residents can afford, de souza said.\\n\\nsince a helmet law is enforced across the colombian border in\\nleticia, drivers stop at the border and pick up a visorless helmet\\nfrom stands along the street. vendors charge 75 cents for the\\nrented helmets, which must be returned at the border.\\n\\nin tabatinga the issue is more complicated. city officials here\\nworry that the border\\'s reputation for violent drug trafficking\\nmakes anyone who wears a helmet a potential suspect.\\n\\n\"where you have trafficking, you have death,\" de souza said.\\n\"when assassins want to kill, they use helmets so they can\\'t be\\nidentified.\"\\n\\nfor that reason, tabatinga informally prohibits the wearing of\\nhelmets on motorbikes, though it is not a written law, he said.\\n\\nthat makes matters even trickier when it rains -- and rain can be\\ntorrential in the amazon.\\n\\nmost moto taxi drivers simply don a rain slicker and continue\\nworking, some wearing helmets. rain is the one time when actual\\nfour-wheeled taxis get a chance to get in the game. but good luck\\nfinding one without calling first.\\n\\ntrying to cement the area\\'s motorbike culture, a decade ago\\nmejia and a friend tried to line up bikes stretching for five\\nkilometers, just over three miles, from tabatinga into leticia. a\\nrepresentative from the guinness book of world records showed up to\\nwitness the world-record attempt, he said. but in the end the duo\\ncould not pull it off.\\n\\n\"if it had been something organized by the city, with\\nresources, we could have gotten into the book,\" mejia said.\\n\"outside of asia no one could beat tabatinga and leticia for\\nhaving more motorbikes, no one.\"\\n\\nconservative commentators had a lot of fun mocking sen. barack\\nobama\\'s use of the phrase, \"the fierce urgency of now.\"\\n\\nnoting that it had originated with the rev. dr. martin luther\\nking jr., obama made it a cornerstone of his early campaign\\nspeeches.\\n\\nconservatives kicked the phrase around like a soccer ball.\\n\"the fierce urgency of now,\" they would say, giggling. what\\ndoes it mean?\\n\\nwell, if your house is on fire and your family is still inside,\\nthat\\'s an example of the fierce urgency of now.\\n\\nsomething like that is the case in the united states right now\\nas americans go to the polls in what is probably the most important\\npresidential election since world war ii. a mind-boggling series of\\ncrises is threatening not just the short-term future but the very\\nviability of the nation.\\n\\nthe economy is sinking into quicksand. the financial sector,\\nguardian of the nation\\'s wealth, is leaning on the crutch of a\\ntrillion-dollar taxpayer bailout. the giant auto companies -- for\\ndecades the high-powered, gas-guzzling, exhaust-spewing pride of\\namerican industry -- are on life support.\\n\\nas the holiday shopping season approaches, the nation is\\nhemorrhaging jobs, the value of the family home has plunged,\\nretirement plans are shrinking like ice cubes on a hot stove and\\neconomists are telling us the recession has only just begun.\\n\\nit\\'s in that atmosphere that voters tuesday will be choosing\\nbetween the crisis-management skills of obama, who has enlisted joe\\nbiden as aide-de-camp, and those of sen. john mccain, who is riding\\nto the rescue with sarah palin and joe the plumber in tow.\\n\\nas important as this choice has become, the election is just a\\nsmall first step. what americans really have to decide is what kind\\nof country they want.\\n\\nright now the united states is a country in which wealth is\\nfunneled, absurdly, from the bottom to the top. the richest 1\\npercent of americans now holds close to 40 percent of all the\\nwealth in the nation and maintains an iron grip on the levers of\\ngovernment power.\\n\\nthis is not only unfair, but self-defeating. the united states\\ncannot thrive with its fabulous wealth concentrated at the top and\\nthe middle class on its knees. (no one even bothers to talk about\\nthe poor anymore.) how to correct this imbalance is one of the\\nbiggest questions facing the country.\\n\\nthe united states is also a country in which blissful ignorance\\nis celebrated, and intellectual excellence (the key to 21st century\\nadvancement) is not just given short shrift, but is ridiculed.\\nparis hilton and britney spears are cultural icons. the average\\namerican watches television a mind-numbing 4 1/2 hours a day.\\n\\nat the same time, our public school system is plagued with some\\nof the highest dropout rates in the industrialized world. math and\\nscience? forget about it. too tough for these tv watchers, or too\\nboring, or whatever.\\n\\n\"when i compare our high schools with what i see when i\\'m\\ntraveling abroad,\" said bill gates, \"i am terrified for our work\\nforce of tomorrow.\"\\n\\nthe point here is that as we approach the end of the first\\ndecade of the 21st century, the united states is in deep, deep\\ntrouble. yet instead of looking for creative, 21st-century\\nsolutions to these enormous problems, too many of our so-called\\nleaders are behaving like clowns, or worse -- spouting garbage in\\nthe pubic sphere that hearkens back to the 1940s and \\'50s.\\n\\nthoughtful, well-educated men and women are denounced as elites,\\nand thus the enemies of ordinary americans. attempts to restore a\\nsemblance of fiscal sanity to a government that has been looted\\nwith an efficiency that would have been envied by the mob, are\\nderided as subversive -- the work of socialists, marxists,\\ncommunists.\\n\\nin 2008!\\n\\nin north carolina, sen. elizabeth dole, a conservative\\nrepublican, is in a tough fight for re-election against a\\ndemocratic state senator, kay hagan. so dole ran a television ad\\nthat showed a close-up of hagan\\'s face while the voice of a\\ndifferent woman asserts, \"there is no god!\"\\n\\namericans have to decide if they want a country that tolerates\\nthis kind of debased, backward behavior. or if they want a country\\nthat aspires to true greatness -- a country that stands for more\\nthan the mere rhetoric of equality, freedom, opportunity and\\njustice.\\n\\nthat decision will require more than casting a vote in one\\npresidential election. it will require a great deal of reflective\\nthought and hard work by a committed citizenry. the great promise\\nof america hinges on a government that works, openly and honestly,\\nfor the broad interests of the american people, as opposed to the\\nnarrow benefit of the favored, wealthy few.\\n\\nby all means, vote today. but that is just the first step toward\\nmeaningful change.\\n\\nthe 2008 race for the white house that comes to an end on\\ntuesday fundamentally upended the way presidential campaigns are\\nfought in america, a legacy that has almost been lost with all the\\nattention being paid to the battle between john mccain and barack\\nobama.\\n\\nit has rewritten the rules on how to reach voters, raise money,\\norganize supporters, manage the news media, track and mold public\\nopinion, and wage -- and withstand -- political attacks, including\\nmany carried by blogs that did not exist four years ago. it has\\nchallenged the consensus view of the american electoral\\nbattleground, suggesting that democrats can at a minimum be\\ncompetitive in states and regions that had long been republican\\nstrongholds.\\n\\nthe size and makeup of the electorate may be changed because of\\ndemocratic efforts to register and turn out new african-american,\\nhispanic and young voters. this shift could have long-lasting\\nramifications for what both parties do to build enduring\\ncoalitions, especially if intensive and technologically driven\\nvoter turnout programs succeed in getting more people registered\\nand to the polls.\\n\\nefforts by democrats to win the allegiance of demographic groups\\nlike african-americans, hispanics and young people could have\\nlong-lasting ramifications for what both parties do to build\\nenduring coalitions, especially if intensive and technologically\\ndriven voter turnout programs succeed in getting more people\\nregistered and to the polls.\\n\\n\"i think we\\'ll be analyzing this election for years as a\\nseminal, transformative race,\" said mark mckinnon, an adviser to\\npresident bush\\'s campaigns in 2000 and 2004. \"the year campaigns\\nleveraged the internet in ways never imagined. the year we went to\\nwarp speed. the year the paradigm got turned upside down and truly\\nbecame bottom up instead of top down.\"\\n\\nto a considerable extent, this is a result of the way that the\\nobama campaign sought to understand and harness the internet (and\\nother forms of so-called new media) to organize supporters and to\\nreach voters who no longer rely primarily on information from\\nnewspapers and television. the platforms ranged from youtube, which\\ndid not exist in 2004, to the cell phone text messages that the\\ncampaign was sending out to supporters on monday to remind them to\\nvote.\\n\\neven more crucial to the way this campaign has transformed\\npolitics has been obama\\'s success at using the internet to build a\\nhuge network of contributors that permitted him to raise enough\\nmoney -- after declining to participate in the public financing\\nsystem -- to expand the map and compete in traditionally republican\\nstates.\\n\\ngoogle, the titan of silicon valley and the\\nqueen of country, dolly parton, are two of the many combatants in a\\nhigh-technology dispute over precious slices of the nation\\'s\\nairwaves.\\n\\nthe issue comes to a head on election day, when the federal\\ncommunications commission votes on a proposal to make a disputed\\nchunk of radio spectrum available for public use.\\n\\ngoogle, microsoft, hewlett-packard and other technology\\ncompanies say the spectrum could be used by a whole new array of\\ninternet-connected wireless gadgets. they say freeing it up would\\nencourage innovation and investment in much the same way that the\\nspread of wi-fi technology has. (this would generate more business\\nfor technology companies.)\\n\\nbut a coalition of old-guard media -- from television networks to\\nbroadway producers -- is objecting to the proposal, saying it needs\\na closer look. the opponents argue that signals sent over those\\nfrequencies could interfere with broadcasts and wireless\\nmicrophones at live productions.\\n\\nthe measure appears likely to pass, though its opponents have\\nmounted a spirited late-stage lobbying effort supported by sen.\\nhillary rodham clinton, d-n.y., and others in congress. also\\nopposed are the professional sports leagues, las vegas casinos, a\\ncoalition of rock musicians and, of late, parton, who produces live\\nshows.\\n\\nif the spectrum is set free, parton says, chaos could reign on\\nbroadway -- in the form of static and other interference.\\n\\ntechnology companies argue that if soothe spectrum is freed,\\nentrepreneurs and innovators will create a new generation of\\ndevices that transmit signals farther and more reliably than wi-fi,\\nwhich also relies on unlicensed spectrum. the technology could also\\nhandle cheap internet-based phone calls.\\n\\nthe battle between the old media and new media companies is a\\nbyproduct of an impending change in the way over-the-air tv signals\\nare delivered. in february, tv stations will be required to switch\\nfrom analog broadcasting to digital, which is less susceptible to\\nradio interference.\\n\\nthe theory behind the fcc proposal is that hand-held devices and\\nother gadgets emit such low levels of power that their\\ntransmissions will not overlap or interfere with the digital tv\\nsignals. also, the proposal\\'s supporters say, devices can be made\\nsmart enough to sense when they might interfere with a broadcast\\nsignal and find another frequency.\\n\\nthe fcc has been studying the potential for interference and\\nfound that most problems can be avoided through tight regulation of\\nthe new devices, said kevin j. martin, chairman of the fcc, who\\nproposed the white space measure.\\n\\nthe five-member commission seems likely to approve the measure,\\naccording to several people who were involved in the agency\\'s\\ninternal discussions but who declined to be named because they were\\nnot authorized to speak to the media.\\n\\nit was supposed to be the term\\'s blockbuster\\nbusiness case, one that might put an end to thousands of\\nstate-court injury suits.\\n\\nbut the argument in the supreme court on monday, in the case of\\na vermont musician who lost her arm after receiving an injection of\\nan anti-nausea drug, quickly turned into a search for limiting\\nprinciples.\\n\\nthe case, wyeth v. levine, no. 06-1249, concerns an implied form\\nof the doctrine of pre-emption, which bars state lawsuits from\\npeople injured by products that met federal safety standards. the\\ndrug law at issue in the case says nothing about pre-emption, and\\nthe question before the court was whether the food and drug\\nadministration\\'s approval of drug labels should knock out state\\nlawsuits contending that the labels did not contain adequate\\nwarnings.\\n\\na broad endorsement of implied pre-emption based on regulators\\'\\nactions rather than on statements in laws enacted by congress could\\nshut down countless injury suits in cases involving not only drugs\\nbut also motor vehicles, household products, chemicals and\\nagricultural products.\\n\\nseveral justices appeared open to the idea that pre-emption\\ncould follow from the fda\\'s approval of a drug label -- but only if\\ndrug companies remained subject to lawsuits if they failed to\\ndisclose new information about potential risks. there was much\\ndiscussion of what information should be considered new.\\n\\nother justices seemed prepared to allow pre-emption -- but only\\nif the drug agency had considered the particular risk before\\napproving the label.\\n\\ngiven the justices\\' interest in those finer points, the court\\nseemed unlikely to rule broadly on the larger issues in the case:\\nwhether the agency and other federal regulators set minimum safety\\nstandards that states are free to augment or whether they make\\njudgments about the optimal balance between risks and benefits that\\nstates must follow.\\n\\nin february, an eight-justice majority of the court ruled, in\\nriegel v. medtronic, that suits concerning injuries caused by\\nmedical devices were pre-empted by a 1976 federal law. but the\\nunderlying law in riegel required pre-emption in so many words: in\\nthe jargon, it involved \"express pre-emption.\"\\n\\nthe plaintiff in the case argued on monday, diana levine, lost\\nher arm after being injected with a wyeth drug, phenergan. the drug\\nis safe, levine\\'s lawyers said, when administered by intramuscular\\ninjection or by intravenous drip. but they said that efforts to\\ninject the drug directly into a vein carry enormous risks.\\n\\na vermont clinic used that third method, known as iv push, and\\napparently missed the vein. when the drug was exposed to levine\\'s\\narterial blood, it caused swift and irreversible gangrene,\\nrequiring amputation of her arm below the elbow.\\n\\nlevine settled with the clinic and sued wyeth, saying the\\ncompany should have added a warning telling doctors not to use the\\nrisky method.\\n\\nseth p. waxman, a lawyer for wyeth, said the company had\\nprovided \"ample, lavish warnings\" about the risks involved and\\nleft it to medical professionals to make the ultimate judgment\\nabout how to administer the drug.\\n\\njustices samuel a. alito jr. and ruth bader ginsburg both\\nquestioned the cost-benefit calculation that allowed the drug to be\\nadministered by iv push.\\n\\n\"on the benefit side of this you don\\'t have a life-saving drug,\\nyou have a drug that relieves nausea,\" alito said. \"on the risk\\nside, you have the risk of gangrene.\"\\n\\njustice antonin scalia said that what mattered was not whether\\nthe agency\\'s decision was sound but whether it had addressed the\\nissue at all. \"if you\\'re telling me the fda acted irresponsibly,\"\\nscalia told levine\\'s lawyer, david c. frederick, \"then sue the\\nfda.\"\\n\\nchief justice john g. roberts jr. tried to boil down frederick\\'s\\nargument to a simple test. if the fda had considered the risks\\ninvolved in iv-push administration, levine would lose; if the fda\\nhad not considered those risks, levine would win.\\n\\nfrederick said levine would win under that analysis, saying the\\nfda had never specifically compared the risks of methods of\\nintravenous administration.\\n\\nwaxman said he understood that \"members of this court are\\nconcerned about applying a broad, vague or freewheeling analysis.\"\\nbut levine\\'s case, he added, is in the \"heartland\" of implied\\npre-emption, given that the jury had awarded damages for wyeth\\'s\\nfailure to alter the very drug label the fda had approved.\\n\\nthe diplomatic tangle between\\nvenezuela, argentina and the united states reached a new pitch on\\nmonday, when a jury in miami convicted a wealthy venezuelan\\nbusinessman of acting as an \"unregistered agent\" of venezuela on\\namerican soil.\\n\\nthe case, known in latin america as \"suitecasegate,\" started\\nwith the discovery of a mysterious suitcase filled with $800,000 in\\ncash at an airport here in august 2007. but it has become a\\nlong-running scandal that has aggravated tensions between the\\nunited states and latin neighbors.\\n\\nfranklin duran, convicted monday, went on trial in miami for\\nconspiring to cover up the origin and destination of the suitcase:\\nit was a secret contribution, prosecutors said, sent by venezuela\\nto the campaign of argentina\\'s president. duran faces a maximum of\\n15 years in prison.\\n\\nthe case has become a symbol of the antagonism between the bush\\nadministration and president hugo chavez of venezuela, who has used\\nhis nation\\'s oil wealth to spread his influence throughout the\\nregion.\\n\\nthe scandal has also soured america\\'s relations with argentina\\nand its president, cristina fernandez de kirchner, whose legitimacy\\nhas been challenged by the revelations of secret campaign donations\\nfrom outside her country.\\n\\nthe eight-week trial in miami revealed an extensive cover-up by\\nvenezuelan officials that reached to chavez himself, who assigned\\nhis intelligence chief to try to keep silent the man caught with\\nthe suitcase, guido alejandro antonini wilson, according to\\ntestimony from witnesses.\\n\\nunbeknownst to the governments of venezuela and argentina,\\nantonini wilson had gone to the fbi just days after arriving back\\nin florida. he subsequently recorded hundreds of hours of\\nconversations between himself and the venezuelans.\\n\\nthree venezuelans and an uruguayan were arrested, including\\nduran, a longtime friend and business acquaintance of antonini\\nwilson. three of the four men who were arrested pleaded guilty to\\nthe same charges duran was convicted of, and two of them were among\\nthe government\\'s star witnesses.\\n\\nas for the $800,000 suitcase, witnesses testified, it was sent\\nby petroleos de venezuela, the national oil company. antonini\\nwilson also testified that he was told an additional $4.2 million\\nwas on the flight to argentina, and he said there had been previous\\noperations to smuggle in political cash from venezuela to other\\ncountries in the region.\\n\\nan internal review by the american military has\\nfound that a local afghan police chief and another district leader\\nhelped taliban militants carry out an attack on july 13 in which\\nnine u.s. soldiers were killed and a remote american outpost in\\neastern afghanistan was nearly overrun.\\n\\nafghan and american forces had started building the makeshift\\nbase just five days before the attack, and villagers repeatedly\\nwarned the american troops in that time that militants were\\nplotting a strike, the report found. it said that the warnings did\\nnot include details, and that troops never anticipated such a large\\nand well-coordinated attack.\\n\\nthe assault involved some 200 fighters, nearly three times the\\nnumber of the american and afghan forces defending the site.\\n\\nas evidence of collusion between the district police chief and\\nthe taliban, the report cited large stocks of weapons and\\nammunition that were found in the police barracks in the adjacent\\nvillage of wanat after the attackers were repelled. the stocks were\\nmore than the local 20-officer force would be likely to need, and\\nmany of the weapons were dirty and appeared to have been used\\nrecently. the police officers were found dressed in \"crisp, clean\\nnew uniforms,\" the report said, and were acting \"as if nothing\\nout of the ordinary had occurred.\"\\n\\nthe attackers were driven back after a pitched four-hour battle,\\nin which american artillery, warplanes and attack helicopters were\\nultimately called in. still, the militants fought in ways that\\nshowed imaginative military training, if not sophisticated weapons.\\n\\nin the midst of the battle, american soldiers were at times\\nflushed out into the open when they fled what they thought were\\ngrenades, but were in fact rocks thrown by taliban attackers, the\\nreport said. the day before the attack, the militants began flowing\\nwater through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating\\nbackground noise that masked the sounds of the advancing fighters.\\n\\nthe base and a nearby observation post were held by just 48\\namerican troops and 24 afghan soldiers. nine americans died and 27\\nwere injured, most in the first 20 minutes of the fight. four\\nafghan soldiers were also wounded.\\n\\nthe intensity of the attack was so fierce, the report said, that\\namerican soldiers shot at insurgents as close as 10 yards away,\\noften until their weapons jammed, and at militants who shimmied up\\ntrees overhanging their positions to shoot at the americans.\\n\\nthe attack on the outpost, near wanat, caused the worst single\\nloss for the american military in afghanistan since june 2005, and\\none of the worst overall since the invasion in late 2001. it\\nunderscored the vulnerability of american forces in afghanistan, as\\nwell as the continuing problem posed by uncertainties over the\\nloyalties of their afghan allies, especially the afghan police.\\n\\nthe military investigating officer, an army colonel whose\\nidentity was not disclosed in a redacted copy of the report\\nprovided to the new york times, recommended that the police chief\\nand the district governor be replaced, if not arrested.\\n\\nbut the senior american commander in eastern afghanistan, maj.\\ngen. jeffrey j. schloesser, decided after conferring with american\\nforces that relieved the unit, that the district governor had\\nprobably been acting under duress and had been cooperative with\\namerican troops, according to the general\\'s spokeswoman, lt. col.\\nrumi nielson-green.\\n\\nnielson-green said in a telephone interview on monday that while\\nthe governor had been absolved, it was unclear whether the police\\nchief in wanat was complicit.\\n\\na spokesman for afghan defense ministry officials said the\\namericans had never discussed these complaints with them.\\n\\nhajji abdul halim, deputy governor at the time of the wanat\\nattack, and now the acting governor of nearby nuristan province,\\nsaid monday that both officials had been detained briefly and then\\nreleased.\\n\\n\"we suspected them after the incident, but the american forces\\nreleased the district governor after two days of custody,\" he said\\nin a telephone interview.\\n\\nthe report, which was completed on aug. 13 and declassified in\\nrecent days to allow military officials to brief family members of\\nthose who were killed, did not assign blame to any commanders of\\nthe unit involved -- the 2nd battalion, 503rd infantry regiment,\\n173rd airborne combat brigade team -- a unit that was in the final\\ndays of a 15-month deployment when the attack took place.\\n\\n\"the actions by leaders at all levels were based upon sound\\nmilitary analysis, proper risk mitigation and for the right\\nreasons,\" the report said.\\n\\nit concluded that despite reports earlier in july that 200 to\\n300 militants had been massing to attack another remote outpost in\\nthe same vicinity, the commanders at wanat had no reason to expect\\nsuch a large frontal assault.\\n\\n\"the enemy normally conducts probing attacks prior to\\nconducting an all-out, large-scale attack,\" the report said,\\nquoting the investigating officer as concluding that it \"was\\nlogical\" to think that an initial probing attack would involve\\nonly about 20 militants seeking to gauge defenses and the reaction\\nof american and afghan forces.\\n\\nhowever, the report criticized the \"incredible amount of time\"\\n-- 10 months -- it took the nato military authorities to negotiate\\narrangements over the site of the outpost, giving adversaries\\nplenty of time \"to plan coordinated and complex attacks.\"\\n\\nsome details of the attack have been described in recent months\\nby publications including the new york times, the army times and\\nvanity fair. but the 44-page report offers the most extensive\\naccount so far. at the time of the attack, american and afghan\\nforces were still building fortifications of sandbags and earthen\\nbarriers around the main outpost and a small observation post about\\n100 yards away. in some places, those troops were protected only by\\nstrands of concertina wire and a ring of gun-mounted, armored\\nhumvees, the report said.\\n\\nthe militants apparently detected the vulnerability and moved to\\nexploit it. on the evening of july 12, the militants slipped into\\nthe village, undetected by the americans, ordered the villagers to\\nleave and set up firing positions inside houses and a mosque.\\n\\nat 4:20 a.m. on july 13, the militants struck with a fusillade\\nof heavy machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades, destroying\\nthe americans\\' most potent weapons: 120-mm mortars and a tow\\nmissile launcher.\\n\\nat the same time, the militants blasted the small observation\\npost 100 yards from the main base with rifle fire and more\\ngrenades. within 20 minutes, all nine americans inside were dead or\\nwounded.\\n\\nthree times, teams of soldiers from the main base ran a gantlet\\nof hostile fire to resupply the observation post and carry back the\\ndead and wounded. within 30 minutes, american fighter-bombers were\\nblasting the militant positions, followed by apache helicopter\\ngunships.\\n\\njust days after the attack, american forces abandoned the\\noutpost at wanat, but nielson-green said the military continued to\\npatrol in the region from a larger base four miles away.\\n\\n\"this was a complex attack carried out by militants who clearly\\nknew the terrain and maintained radio silence,\" he said.\\n\\ngunmen dressed as security guards kidnapped\\na french aid worker in central kabul monday morning and shot dead\\nan afghan bystander who tried to thwart the abduction, police and\\nwitnesses said.\\n\\nthe kidnapping was the latest of a series of incidents spreading\\nalarm among foreigners in the capital. it was carried out just\\nafter 9 a.m. on a busy street of shops and homes\\n\\nlast month, a british aid worker with dual south african\\nnationality, gayle williams, 34, was killed in kabul and the\\ntaliban said it had executed her for spreading christianity. there\\nwas no immediate claim if responsibility for monday\\'s kidnapping\\nbut the taliban denied involvement.\\n\\ntwo french aid workers were making

uncle,\\nghulam hazrat, 50, said the kidnappers were dressed as security\\nguards. there has been a string of kidnappings in the capital and\\nneighboring provinces recently involving both foreigners and\\nprominent afghans. many of them have been blamed by afghan\\nofficials on criminal gangs seeking ransom.\\n\\na relative of the royal family, homayun shah, and the son of a\\nprominent banker were kidnapped in recent weeks but were freed by\\nthe intelligence service, the national security directorate.\\n\\na report released by the alaska personnel\\nboard on monday found that gov. sarah palin did not apply improper\\npressure to try to dismiss a state trooper who was her former\\nbrother in law and did not violate state ethics laws in the firing\\nof her state public safety commissioner.\\n\\nthe report contradicts the conclusions last month of a separate\\ninquiry into the matter overseen by a bipartisan legislative panel.\\nthe panel found that palin had breached a state ethics act by\\npressing to have the trooper, mike wooten, fired. it said, however,\\nthat the governor was within her rights to fire the public safety\\ncommissioner, walt monegan.\\n\\nthe board\\'s report, based on an investigation led by an\\nindependent counsel hired by the board, timothy j. petumenos,\\nconcluded there was no evidence to prove ms. palin or any state\\nemployee had acted improperly in monegan\\'s dismissal.\\n\\nthe report said the legislative inquiry had based its\\nconclusions on an incorrect interpretation of state ethics laws and\\ninsufficient evidence.\\n\\npalin\\'s lawyer, thomas v. van flein, said in a statement, \"the\\ngovernor is grateful that this investigation has provided a fair\\nand impartial review of this matter and upholds the governor\\'s\\nability to take measures when necessary to ensure that alaskans\\nhave the best possible team working to serve them.\"\\n\\nmonegan has said he believes he was fired because he would not\\nbend to pressure from palin, her husband, todd, and her\\nsubordinates to fire wooten, who had been through a bitter divorce\\nwith the governor\\'s sister. he has also said that he had received\\nmany complaints about wooten from palin, her husband, and several\\nmembers of her administration and that he felt clear pressure to\\nterminate wooten.\\n\\npetumenos said the governor and other state employees had\\ntestified firmly that several conversations monegan described had\\nnot happened. he said there were no witnesses other than monegan\\nwho said they heard the conversations.\\n\\n\"they didn\\'t happen at all,\" petumenos said.\\n\\n\"unless someone can be proved to abuse their power,\" petumenos\\nadded, \"it seems to me they haven\\'t done it.\"\\n\\nmonegan said monday in an interview, \"obviously i\\'m\\ndisappointed with the outcome and the contradictory nature of this\\ninvestigation, compared to the first one.\\n\\n\"it\\'s not only me,\" he said. \"there were senior members of\\nthe department of public safety who got the calls, felt the\\npressure and knew exactly what was going on, \"i will always feel\\nthat there were conversations and e-mails that were intended to\\ninappropriately use an official government position to settle a\\nfamily matter.\"\\n\\nthe governor of alaska appoints the members of the alaska\\npersonnel board, though all three of the board\\'s current members\\nwere appointed by palin\\'s predecessor. palin reappointed one member\\nto a new term, said a spokesman for the governor, bill mcallister.\\n\\n\"this is obviously the correct outcome,\" mcallister said. \"we\\nknew all along that governor palin did not abuse her power.\"\\n\\njohn cyr, the executive director of the alaska public safety\\nemployees association, said it was not surprising that a board\\nappointed by the governor\\'s office would reach the conclusion.\\n\\n\"we all knew that the governor\\'s office was putting pressure\\non\" the department of public safety \"to take action against\\nmichael wooten,\" cyr said.\\n\\nin late july, several weeks after monegan was fired, the state\\'s\\nbipartisan legislative council ordered an inquiry into his. but\\ntension over the matter increased dramatically in late august, when\\npalin was selected as the running mate for sen. john mccain, the\\nrepublican nominee for president. the inquiry undercut her image as\\nan ethics reformer.\\n\\npalin said in the summer that she would cooperate with the\\nlegislative inquiry but, after she was nominated, she refused to\\ntestify. the mccain-palin campaign sent lawyers and staff to alaska\\nto help with the governor\\'s legal strategy and to make what for\\nseveral weeks was an almost daily public relations effort to\\nportray the legislative inquiry as biased, and run by democrats who\\nsupport sen. barack obama.\\n\\nin september, palin took the unusual step of filing an ethics\\ncomplaint against herself to the personnel board, which she said\\nwas the proper forum for dealing with the matter. the board\\'s\\nreport, conducted by petumenos, was what was filed on monday.\\n\\nthe report by petumenos said it was based on \"substantially\\nmore evidence\" than the legislative inquiry, including a\\nthree-hour deposition from palin. the governor refused to testify\\nfor the legislative inquiry.\\n\\npetumenos said the legislative inquiry had determined that palin\\nviolated the scope of state ethics laws by \"inaction,\" because\\nshe supposedly did not stop her staff and husband from pressuring\\nmonegan. but petumenos said that the legislative inquiry had not\\nmet requirements for finding a violation because it did not cite\\nviolations under specific sections of the ethics code.\\n\\nit was supposed to be the term\\'s blockbuster\\nbusiness case, one that might put an end to thousands of\\nstate-court injury suits.\\n\\nbut the argument in the supreme court on monday, in the case of\\na vermont musician who lost her arm after receiving an injection of\\nan anti-nausea drug, quickly turned into a search for limiting\\nprinciples.\\n\\nthe case, wyeth v. levine, no. 06-1249, concerns an implied form\\nof the doctrine of pre-emption, which bars state lawsuits from\\npeople injured by products that met federal safety standards. the\\ndrug law at issue in the case says nothing about pre-emption, and\\nthe question before the court was whether the food and drug\\nadministration\\'s approval of drug labels should knock out state\\nlawsuits contending that the labels did not contain adequate\\nwarnings.\\n\\na broad endorsement of implied pre-emption based on regulators\\'\\nactions rather than on statements in laws enacted by congress could\\nshut down countless injury suits in cases involving not only drugs\\nbut also motor vehicles, household products, chemicals and\\nagricultural products.\\n\\nseveral justices appeared open to the idea that pre-emption\\ncould follow from the fda\\'s approval of a drug label -- but only if\\ndrug companies remained subject to lawsuits if they failed to\\ndisclose new information about potential risks. there was much\\ndiscussion of what information should be considered new.\\n\\nother justices seemed prepared to allow pre-emption -- but only\\nif the drug agency had considered the particular risk before\\napproving the label.\\n\\ngiven the justices\\' interest in those finer points, the court\\nseemed unlikely to rule broadly on the larger issues in the case:\\nwhether the agency and other federal regulators set minimum safety\\nstandards that states are free to augment or whether they make\\njudgments about the optimal balance between risks and benefits that\\nstates must follow.\\n\\nthe plaintiff in the case argued on monday, diana levine, lost\\nher arm after being injected with a wyeth drug, phenergan. the drug\\nis safe, levine\\'s lawyers said, when administered by intramuscular\\ninjection or by intravenous drip. but they said that efforts to\\ninject the drug directly into a vein carry enormous risks.\\n\\na vermont clinic used that third method, known as iv push, and\\napparently missed the vein. when the drug was exposed to levine\\'s\\narterial blood, it caused swift and irreversible gangrene,\\nrequiring amputation of her arm below the elbow.\\n\\nlevine settled with the clinic and sued wyeth, saying the\\ncompany should have added a warning telling doctors not to use the\\nrisky method.\\n\\nseth p. waxman, a lawyer for wyeth, said levine\\'s case, he\\nadded, is in the \"heartland\" of implied pre-emption, given that\\nthe jury had awarded damages for wyeth\\'s failure to alter the very\\ndrug label the fda had approved.\\n\\na federal court has blocked the bush\\nadministration\\'s effort to save money on medicare by paying for\\nonly the least expensive treatments for particular conditions.\\n\\ncongress sets medicare payment rates and never intended to give\\nofficials broad discretion to alter them, the court said in an\\nimportant test case last month.\\n\\nthe case, closely followed by medicare officials and consumer\\nadvocates, involved drugs used to treat chronic obstructive\\npulmonary disease.\\n\\njudge henry h. kennedy jr. of u.s. district court here said the\\npolicy of paying for only \"the least costly alternative\" was not\\npermitted under the medicare law.\\n\\nthe administration\\'s position would give the health and human\\nservices secretary \"enormous discretion\" to determine the amount\\npaid for every item and service covered by medicare, without\\nreference to the detailed formulas set by congress, kennedy said.\\n\"this flies in the face of the detailed statutory provisions,\" he\\nadded.\\n\\nover the years, medicare officials have often tried to adopt\\nregulations that allow them to consider cost in deciding whether\\nthe program should cover various goods and services. health care\\nproviders, manufacturers and some patients\\' advocates have resisted\\nthese efforts, saying that coverage decisions should be made based\\non clinical effectiveness and not cost.\\n\\n\"we are disappointed with the ruling and continue to believe\\nthat our policy is supported by the statute,\" peter l. ashkenaz, a\\nspokesman for the federal centers for medicare and medicaid\\nservices, said monday. \"we are still considering our options and\\nnext steps.\"\\n\\ncongress set forth the touchstone for medicare coverage in a\\n1965 law that created the program. the law generally prohibits\\npayment for items and services that are \"not reasonable and\\nnecessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury, or\\nto improve the functioning of a malformed body member.\"\\n\\nif an item is covered, the payment rate is specified in other\\nparts of the law.\\n\\nthe bush administration argued that medicare officials had the\\nright to decide whether the expense incurred for a given item, not\\njust the item itself, was \"reasonable and necessary.\"\\n\\nkennedy said this argument \"does not make sense\" because\\ncongress went to great lengths to establish payment rates.\\n\\nyour tube\\n\\n2008 was the year that youtube became a mainstream tool for\\npolitical

the 1990s when corporations began employing\\naggressive\\ntactics to save on tax bills. since then, massachusetts has sued\\nhundreds\\nof companies for back taxes totaling more than $1 billion. some\\nfirms have\\nagreed to pay before the cases have been resolved, reserving their\\nright\\nto\\nget their money back if the state loses.\\n\\nthe toys \"r\" us case is the most prominent of such disputes.\\nthe toy\\ncompany nearly 20 years ago set up a subsidiary in delaware, and\\ngave that\\nunit ownership of its trademark, geoffrey the giraffe. delaware\\ndoes not\\ntax income on intangible assets such as trademarks.\\n\\nthe company had its stores in massachusetts and other states pay\\nroyalties\\nto the delaware firm for use of the geoffrey trademark, according\\nto court\\nfilings. tax officials said the move effectively transferred\\nprofits that\\nwould be taxable in massachusetts to a nontax jurisdiction. the\\namount now\\nin dispute is $1.6 million, plus penalties and interest between\\n1997 and\\n2001.\\n\\nthe legal battle involves competing interpretations of the\\ncommerce\\nclause\\nof the us constitution, which regulates trade across state

the state.\\n\\nlawyers for toys \"r\" us and other companies with similar\\ndisputes\\ncontend in court filings the constitution only allows states to tax\\nbusinesses that are physically present within their borders, an\\ninterpretation that would prevent the delaware subsidiary from\\nbeing taxed\\nby other states.\\n\\nthat interpretation, however, has failed to persuade courts in\\nsouth\\ncarolina, louisiana, new york, and oklahoma, which over the years\\nhave\\nruled against toys \"r\" us.\\n\\na toys \"r\" us spokesman did not respond to a call seeking\\ncomment. a\\nspokesman for microsoft, which has a similar legal fight here, said\\nit has\\ncomplied with state tax laws and will continue to seek a resolution\\nin\\ncourt.\\n\\nin the capital one case, the state argues the bank effectively\\nhas a\\ntaxable business presence in massachusetts because of the thousands\\nof\\ncredit card transactions it has with card holders and businesses,\\neven\\nthough it doesn\\'t have a local branch office or other physical\\npresence\\nhere.\\n\\ncapital one did not return a phone call seeking comment. in\\ncourt\\ndocuments, capital one argued that because it does not have\\nemployees or\\nproperty in massachusetts, it should not pay state taxes under the\\ncommerce\\nclause. and lawyers for other companies said the state is trying to\\nequate\\na transaction on an electronic network with one in a local bank\\nbranch.\\n\\n\"this is about something much more important than tax\\ndollars,\" said\\ngriswold, the attorney who represents mbna. \"it\\'s about the\\nprinciple of\\nfederalism and when states are going to be permitted to reach\\nbeyond their\\nborders to exercise dominion over citizens of another state.\"\\n\\nmbna has a dispute with massachusetts that mirrors the capital\\none case.\\n\\nthe tjx lawsuit involves an arrangement the company set up in\\nthe early\\n1990s that treated royalty and interest payments from subsidiaries\\nas\\ndeductions that lowered its overall tax liability. in the late\\n1990s,\\nmassachusetts pressed the retailer to pay more taxes on the grounds\\nthe\\ndeductions were improper.\\n\\nthe contested amount is around $19.6 million. in 2006, the\\nstate\\'s\\nappellate tax board ruled in the revenue department\\'s favor,\\nalthough it\\nlater allowed tjx some of the deductions. a tjx spokeswoman\\ndeclined to\\ncomment.\\n\\nin a similar case, a comcast spokeswoman said the company\\nbelieves it has\\ncomplied with tax laws and is working with the state to resolve the\\nmatter,\\nwhich involves issues from its acquisition of at&amp;amp;t broadband in\\n2002. a\\nspokesman for home depot also said the company is working with the\\nstate.\\n\\nthis year, the massachusetts legislature changed the state\\'s\\ncorporate\\ntax\\nlaw to prevent many of these disputes from arising in the first\\nplace. the\\nlaw, known as combined reporting, requires

the end of the long boom, which began in\\n1983. politically, it probably marks the end of conservative\\ndominance, which began in 1980. generationally, it marks the end of\\nbaby boomer supremacy, which began in 1968. for the past 16 years,\\nbaby boomers, who were formed by the tumult of the 1960s, occupied\\nthe white house. by tuesday night, if the polls are to be believed,\\na member of a

private achievement and public disappointment.\\nin the past two decades, the united states has become a much more\\ninteresting place. companies like starbucks, apple, crate &amp;amp; barrel,\\nmicrosoft and many others enlivened daily life. private citizens,\\nespecially young people, repaired the social fabric, dedicated\\nthemselves to community service and lowered crime and teenage\\npregnancy.\\n\\nyet, at the same time, the public sphere has not flourished.\\ndespite decades of affluence, long-standing issues like health\\ncare, education, energy and entitlement debt have not been\\nadequately addressed. the baby boomers, who entered adulthood\\npromising a lifetime of activism, have been a politically\\nundistinguished generation. they produced two presidents, neither\\nof whom lived up to his potential. they remained consumed by the\\nculture war that divided their generation. they pass their\\npolitical supremacy today having squandered the fat years and the\\ngolden opportunities.\\n\\nmonth by month, frustration has mounted. americans are anxious\\nabout their private lives but absolutely disgusted by public\\nleaders. so change is demanded.\\n\\nrepublicans nominated an old warrior with a record of making\\nhard decisions and absorbing the blows that ensue. many of us\\nregard him -- and always will -- as one of the heroes of our time.\\nbut the public demand for change was total, and if the polls are\\nright, voters will elect the man who breaks from the recent past in\\nalmost every way.\\n\\nbarack obama is a child of a

adulthood. theirs is a generation of\\nconsolidation and neo-traditionalism -- a generation of sunscreen\\nand bicycle helmets, more anxious about parenthood than anything\\nelse.\\n\\nobama is not

10\\nuniversities.\\n\\nhis upscale, educated class post-boomer cohort has rallied\\nbehind him with unalloyed fervor. major college newspapers have\\nendorsed him at a ratio of 63-1. the upscale

which they are the\\nleast prepared: the problem of scarcity.\\n\\nraised in prosperity, favored by genetics, these young\\nmeritocrats will have to govern in a period when the demands on the\\nnation\\'s wealth outstrip the supply. they will grapple with the\\ngrowing burdens of an aging society, rising health care costs and\\nhigh energy prices. they will have to make up for the

starker divisions along\\nfactional lines. the challenge for the next president will be to\\ncushion the pain of the coming recession while at the same time\\ntrying to build a solid fiscal foundation so the country can thrive\\nat some point in the future.\\n\\nwe\\'re probably entering a period, in other words, in which smart\\nyoung liberals meet a stone-cold scarcity that they do not seem

america, including most of the\\nbattleground states, will see fair weather that will encourage\\nvoters to go to the polls. according to the national weather\\nservice, temperatures are expected be mild for this time of year in\\nmany large urban areas, and precipitation should be minimal.\\n\\nweather, of course, can be a factor in voter turnout, especially\\nfor democrats. because democrats tend to be less affluent than\\nrepublicans and to live in larger cities, the theory goes, they not\\nonly depend more on public transportation to get to the polls, but\\nalso vote in precincts that are prone to long lines, and thus are\\nmore vulnerable to bad weather.\\n\\na 2004 study of a century\\'s worth of data about weather on\\nelection day concluded that when it rained, \"the negative effect\\non democratic performance of turnout is significantly increased\"\\nand that \"weather accounts for about a 5-point swing in turnout.\"\\n\\nanother study, published in 2005, found that every inch of rain\\nabove average on election day gives republicans an additional 2.5\\npercent of the vote, and every inch of snow above average increases\\nthe republican vote share by 0.6 percent.\\n\\nso where are the exceptions to sunny skies? north carolina and\\nvirginia, which are heavily contested, are expected to get rain,\\nand up to 3 or 4 inches in some areas. and the pacific northwest\\ninto the rockies could see significant amounts of rain or snow,\\nthough primarily in uncontested wyoming (reliably republican).\\n\\nsome parts of colorado, which has emerged as one of the\\nmost-contested states in the campaign, could also be hit by that\\nstorm, but nevada, another battleground state, is not likely to be\\naffected.\\n\\nand in missouri, where the race is perhaps the tightest in the\\ncountry, \"it\\'s going to be a beautiful day for voting,\" said\\nbrian cordy, a forecaster at the national weather service.\\n\\n-- larry rohter\\n\\nstyle: no hip-hop look for

of the 2008 campaign for the subject\\nof undergarments to come up again, and it was an mtv interviewer\\nwho brought it up.\\n\\nthe answer from sen. barack obama: keep them in your pants.\\n\\nthe subject was raised by sway calloway of mtv news, who asked\\nobama if he supported ordinances to ban sagging pants, a style\\ninspired by hip-hop artists.\\n\\n\"here is my attitude,\" obama replied. \"i think people passing\\na law against people wearing sagging pants is a waste of time. we\\nshould be focused on creating jobs, improving our schools, health\\ncare, dealing with the war in iraq, and anybody, any public\\nofficial, that is worrying about sagging pants probably needs to\\nspend some time focusing on real problems out there.\"\\n\\nbut it was clear that obama was not a fan of the look.\\n\\n\"brothers should pull up their pants,\" he said. \"you are\\nwalking by your mother, your grandmother; your underwear is\\nshowing. what\\'s wrong with that? come on.\"\\n\\nobama passed on the boxers-or-briefs question earlier this year\\nwhen it was posed by a reporter for us weekly.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t answer those humiliating questions. but whichever one\\nit is, i look good

the country.\\n\\n\"it\\'s been on the edge of reality,\" berry reece, author of the\\nseries, said of the current election.\\n\\n\"i frankly had forgotten about this pettigrew series,\" reece\\nadded, until national public radio unearthed it earlier this year.\\n\\nwriting in 1964 of an election 12 years later, reece, now 76,\\ninitially used the story of pettigrew and his bid for the\\ndemocratic nod to walk students \"through the abc\\'s of the\\nnomination process.\"\\n\\nthe candidate survives an assassination attempt and soldiers\\nthrough a debate with sen. willard oilandgas, but his face is\\nhidden until the last few panels of the final episode.\\n\\n\"what we wanted to do,\" reece said, \"was get the readers in\\ndeep through this pettigrew\\'s integrity, his charisma, before we\\never disclosed his race so that they would not prejudge him.\"\\n\\nreece said he was inspired by the political turmoil of the\\nperiod, especially in his home state,

back. that\\'s painfully bad news for most\\nof us,\\nbut a big opportunity for him.\\n\\ncompared with other daunting challenges that will face either\\nbarack obama\\nor john mccain as president, the economy in general and the stock\\nmarket in\\nparticular are fixable. markets are notoriously difficult to\\npredict, but\\nthey almost always rebound from plunging corrections over time.\\nfour years\\nshould be plenty.\\n\\nthe current stock market decline is not historic, but it has\\nbeen\\nwrenchingly bad. the dow jones industrial average has lost 34.5\\npercent\\nsince its peak reached in october 2007. all but one of the dow\\naverage\\'s 30\\nstocks has lost money this year.\\n\\nother presidents who took office with the nation in financial\\nturmoil\\nbenefitted from the stock market\\'s resilience. franklin roosevelt,\\nronald\\nreagan, and even gerald ford saw a troubled market begin to rebound\\nin less\\nthan four years.\\n\\nall three of those presidents faced different specific\\nchallenges but each\\ninherited stock markets suffering because of serious economic\\nproblems when\\nthey first took office. roosevelt famously dealt with the great\\ndepression\\nof the 1930s. reagan took office amid a recession and sky-high\\ninterest\\nrates of 18 to 20 percent. ford battled a recession and\\ndouble-digit\\ninflation rates of the mid-1970s.\\n\\nthe nation\\'s economic problems did not disappear by the end of\\nthose terms\\nand the economy remained downright dire in 1936 after roosevelt\\'s\\nfirst\\nfour years in office. but stock prices had moved sharply higher in\\neach\\ncase.\\n\\nthe stock market roughly tripled in value during the first\\nroosevelt term.\\nthe ford stock market lost ground at first but eventually climbed\\nabout 20\\npercent. the dow jones industrials earned a total return of 60\\npercent\\nduring the first reagan term, which turned out to be the launching\\npad for\\none of the 20th century\\'s great bull markets despite the crash of\\n1987.\\n\\none safe bet: we will still be looking at real economic problems\\nat the\\nend of the coming administration\\'s four-year term. but, stock\\nprices will\\nalso be significantly higher than today\\'s levels.\\n\\nhistory offers a few stock market lessons for the next\\npresident. he can\\nhelp, by trying to stimulate the economy and projecting leadership\\nat a\\ntime when confidence matters more than usual. the next president\\ncould\\nexercise real power by doing both. but he will also discover the\\nlimits to\\nhis influence over the market.\\n\\n\"the president is not responsible for the stock market,\" says\\nrichard\\nsylla, a market historian and economics professor at new york\\nuniversity.\\n\"but if they appear to be in charge and do things to address the\\ncountry\\'s\\neconomic ills, people will rally behind them a little bit. it\\'s\\nalmost a\\npsychological thing. people feel good about a new president\\nanyway.\"\\n\\nroosevelt certainly projected leadership as a new president, as\\ndid\\nreagan. what each actually did - launching the new deal, cutting\\ntaxes -\\nalso made a difference. but other factors beyond their control were\\nat\\nwork, too.\\n\\nthe stock market had fallen so dramatically by the time\\nroosevelt took\\noffice in 1933, it was almost impossible for it to go lower. in\\nfact,\\nstocks had actually bounced off the bottom before he took office.\\nthe\\nmarket soared during roosevelt\\'s first term, but fell hard after he\\nwon\\nre-election. call that good political timing all the way around.\\n\\nreagan came to office in early 1981 pursuing change his admirers\\ncalled a\\nrevolution, but federal reserve chairman paul volcker was more\\nimportant to\\nthe economy and markets. volcker drove interest rates sky high to\\ncurb\\ndangerous inflation. the strategy worked and the stock market\\nadvanced, but\\nthe high rates inflicted real pain along the way. sylla says reagan\\nadvisers worried about the political fallout and initially urged\\nthe\\npresident to blame everything on volcker, which he declined to do.\\nvolcker\\nis remembered for bold action, but reagan also benefitted from the\\nstock\\nmarket boost.\\n\\nthe ford presidency is such a strange historical period it\\'s\\nhard to know\\nwhat to make of the stock market\\'s relationship to the white house\\nin those\\nyears. after taking office in the summer of 1974, ford labored to\\nright the\\neconomy, campaigning to \"whip inflation now,\" but never seemed\\ncompletely\\neffective.\\n\\nultimately all three benefited from timing, too. the ups and\\ndowns of\\nbusiness are just as important to the stock market as decisions\\nmade in the\\nwhite house. policies are important, but timing helps.\\n\\n\"an administration can make some difference at the margin with\\npolicies,\" says john carey, a veteran portfolio manager at pioneer\\ninvestments in boston. \"but i think it\\'s the business cycle that\\ndrives\\nthe market over long periods of time.\"\\n\\ntiming may have helped the stock market of bill clinton, who\\narrived in\\nand departed from washington under ideal economic circumstances.\\nand\\nperhaps timing hurt president bush, whose terms spanned the\\ntechnology\\nstock bust, the sept. 11, 2001,

the white house, capping a campaign in which the\\ncandidates\\nfought conventional skirmishes on deeply unconventional political\\nterrain.\\n\\nobama and mccain closed out the final sprint of the marathon\\nwith\\nintensive pushes across a half-dozen states likely to determine\\ntuesday\\'s\\nelection. mccain raced defensively through a series of states\\npresident\\nbush won in 2004. obama, sobered by his 86-year-old grandmother\\'s\\ndeath\\nearly monday, finished with three rallies in republican bastions -\\nflorida,\\nnorth carolina, and virginia - that reflected his push to expand\\nthe\\ndemocrat map.\\n\\ncontinuing the sharp attacks right to the finish line, the two\\ncandidates\\ndelivered arguments monday that were more urgent versions of the\\nhighly\\npartisan messages they have been hitting hard for weeks: obama, the\\ndemocratic nominee, asserted that republicans are siding with wall\\nstreet\\nbarons and fortune 500 companies over middle-class families, while\\nmccain,\\nthe gop nominee, warned that democrats\\' spending plans would send\\namerica\\ninto another depression.\\n\\n\"tax and spend, tax and spend,\" mccain said at an airport\\nhangar in\\nblountville, tenn., a stop targeting media markets in southwest\\nvirginia\\nand northwest north carolina. \"that\\'s what they\\'re all about, my\\nfriends.\"\\n\\ntwice in one speech, he accused obama of being in the \"far-left\\nlane of\\namerican politics,\" and at each stop took aim at democratic\\ncongressional\\nleaders, including representative barney frank of newton, mass., as\\nreadily as he pointed at the nominee himself.\\n\\n\"watch out, they\\'re even talking about taxing your 401(k)\\ncontributions,\"\\nmccain said at pittsburgh international airport. \"i\\'m going to\\nprotect\\npeople\\'s retirement, not tax it. i\\'m going to protect social\\nsecurity. i\\'m\\ngoing to protect medicare.\"\\n\\neven as obama told voters it was time to move beyond the \"old\\narguments\"\\nbetween republicans and democrats that have generated so much\\nwashington\\ngridlock, the illinois senator, drawing on the central plank of his\\ncandidacy, sought to paint mccain as an out-of-touch republican who\\ncared\\nmore about the wealthy than he did average workers.\\n\\nat his first rally, in front of more than 9,000 people at\\njacksonville\\'s\\nveterans memorial arena, obama hammered mccain anew for saying, in\\nthe same\\nsetting on sept. 15, that \"the fundamentals of our economy are\\nstrong.\"\\n\\n\"that day, more than 5,000 jobs were lost, more than 7,000\\nhomes were\\nforeclosed on,\" said obama, whose stump speech was repeatedly\\ninterrupted\\nby chants of \"o-ba-ma\" and \"yes we can!\"\\n\\n\"the day before, former fed chairman alan greenspan said we\\nwere in a\\n\\'once in a century\\' crisis,\" he continued. \"florida, you and i\\nknow that\\nnot only was john mccain fundamentally wrong, it sums up the fact\\nthat he\\'s\\nout of touch.\"\\n\\nwhen boos filled the arena, obama used a rejoinder he has\\nemployed at\\nnearly every rally over the past week: \"you don\\'t need to boo. you\\njust\\nneed to vote.\"\\n\\nthe back-and-forth over taxes and the economy is one of several\\nfamiliar\\ndisputes that mccain and obama - both of whom portray themselves as\\npoliticians unburdened by the usual left-right divides - have\\nsparred over\\nthroughout their campaign. the candidates have veered little from\\ntheir\\nparty lines on trade (mccain embraces it, obama wants more\\nprotections for\\namerican workers); on healthcare (mccain favors a market approach,\\nobama\\ncalls for more government involvement); and on foreign policy\\n(mccain talks\\ntough, obama emphasizes diplomacy).\\n\\nbut if their policy clashes resemble those in past elections,\\ntheir\\nbattlefield most certainly does not. in any other recent\\npresidential\\ncontest, it would be impossible to imagine a democratic candidate\\nspending\\nthe eve of the election in north carolina, which last voted for a\\ndemocratic presidential candidate 32 years ago, and virginia, which\\nlast\\ndid so 44 years ago. but polls suggest obama has a shot at winning\\nboth\\nstates, and he hoped a final exclamation point might make the\\ndifference.\\n\\nmonday evening, obama revved up about 25,000 supporters on the\\ncampus of\\nthe university of north carolina-charlotte who braved pouring rain\\nto hear\\nhis last-minute appeals.\\n\\n\"i know it\\'s a little drizzly and you\\'ve been standing here\\ngetting wet,\"\\nhe said.\\n\\n\"that\\'s all right - you worth it!\" a woman screamed back.\\n\\n\"when we started 21 months ago,\" obama continued, \"i didn\\'t\\nknow how it\\nwould turn out. and no matter what happens ... i\\'m going to feel\\ngood about\\nhow it\\'s turned out, because all of you have created this\\nincredible\\ncampaign.\"\\n\\nof the 20 events obama held in the final full week of\\ncampaigning, just one\\n- a rally outside philadelphia a week ago - was in a state that\\ndemocrat\\njohn f. kerry won in 2004. the rest were in the traditional\\nbattlegrounds\\nof florida and ohio, but also newly competitive colorado, indiana,\\nmissouri, nevada, north carolina, and virginia.\\n\\nthe capstone of obama\\'s almost two years of campaigning was a\\nlate-night\\nrally in manassas, va., outside washington, d.c., in prince william\\ncounty,\\nwhich bush won by seven percentage points in 2004.\\n\\nmccain, who has followed a lighter schedule than obama,\\napproached the\\nlast tour of his nearly 18-month campaign as a chance to catch up\\nwith a\\ngrueling seven-state swing monday. he asserted confidence about his\\nchances\\ntuesday in the face of what polls suggest are long odds. \"there\\'s\\njust one\\nday left until we take america in a new direction,\" mccain told a\\nraucous,\\nsalsa-paced midnight rally in miami alongside actor kelsey grammer\\nand\\nkansas senator sam brownback.\\n\\nfrom there, he launched a 20-hour fly-around covering a range of\\npolitical\\nterrain - from tampa, a booming coastal metropolis rich in suburban\\nindependents to prescott, the old territorial capital of his native\\narizona, a state that has become competitive in the campaign\\'s\\nclosing\\nweeks.\\n\\nfueled by coffee and fried chicken, mccain grew both hoarse and\\npunchier as\\nhis long day went on. \"joe lieberman and joe the plumber are the\\nbest!\"\\nhe exulted at one point.\\n\\nwith the exception of pennsylvania, all the states where mccain\\ncampaigned\\nmonday voted for bush in 2004. he is expected to visit another,\\ncolorado,\\nwhile voters are at the polls tuesday.\\n\\nobama will spend election night in chicago, but plans a quick\\nside trip\\nto the indianapolis area to greet voters midday. his campaign is\\nexpressing\\nconfidence in its turnout operation.\\n\\nmore than 29 million people in 30 states already voted as of\\nmonday,\\ndemocrats had submitted 1 million more ballots than republicans,\\nand heavy\\nearly voting by democrats in several swing states suggests that\\nobama goes\\ninto tuesday with an edge, according to an associated press\\nanalysis.\\n\\nin a radio interview monday, obama said he was calm, befitting a\\ncandidate\\nahead in the polls. \"i feel pretty peaceful, i gotta say,\" he\\nsaid on the\\n\"russ parr morning show.\" \"because my attitude is if we\\'ve done\\neverything we can do, then it\\'s up to the people to decide. and the\\nquestion is

department,\\nwhich is scrutinizing the deal for its effect on competition, a\\nperson briefed on the revised plan said on monday.\\n\\nthe advertising deal calls for google to place ads next to some\\nweb search results on yahoo, lifting yahoo\\'s revenue. under the\\nrevised terms, the deal would be shortened to two years, from as\\nmany as 10, said the person, who agreed to speak only on condition\\nof anonymity because the discussions remained confidential.\\n\\nin addition, the amount that yahoo could earn from ads placed by\\ngoogle would be capped at 25 percent of yahoo\\'s search advertising\\nrevenue, the person said. previously, yahoo had the discretion to\\ndecide how much of its search ads to turn over to google.\\n\\ngoogle and yahoo submitted the new proposal to the justice\\ndepartment over the weekend. it is not clear whether the\\nlimitations will be enough to satisfy antitrust investigators, who\\nhave raised objections to the planned partnership.\\n\\nrepresentatives for yahoo and google declined to comment on the\\nnew proposal, but said that discussions with the justice department\\nwere continuing. gina talamona, a department spokeswoman, said the\\nmatter was pending but declined to comment further.\\n\\nthe proposed limits on the partnership, if accepted by\\nregulators, would most likely reduce the financial benefits of the\\ndeal for yahoo, which has been struggling to accelerate its growth\\nin the wake of failed merger talks with microsoft. the company has\\nsaid it hopes to receive $250 million to $450 million in additional\\noperating cash flow from the agreement in its first year.\\n\\nfor google, a more limited deal would also be a setback, but\\nwould most likely be worth pursuing if it averted a showdown with\\nregulators over the company\\'s growing power. groups representing\\nsome of the nation largest advertisers, who are google\\'s most\\nimportant customers, have said that the deal could reduce\\ncompetition, lead to higher prices and strengthen its dominance of\\nthe search advertising market.\\n\\none critic of the deal said that the revisions would do nothing\\nto make the agreement more palatable to advertisers. \"if a deal\\ncan\\'t survive long-term scrutiny, what\\'s the benefit of allowing it\\nfor the short term?\" said robert d. liodice, president of the\\nassociation of national advertisers, which has urged the justice\\ndepartment to oppose the deal.\\n\\nthe companies have said that the deal would actually be good for\\ncompetition, and that they do not control ad prices, which are set\\nthrough auctions.\\n\\na cap on the percentage of revenue that yahoo could earn would\\nensure that it would not use the deal to slowly exit the search\\nadvertising market -- a situation that some advertisers said was\\nlikely and that would give google a virtual monopoly on the largest\\nand most profitable portion of the online advertising business.\\n\\nthe new proposal came as the discussions between the companies\\nand the justice department appeared to have run their course. a\\nresolution -- either a decision by the department to file a suit to\\nblock the deal, a decision by the companies to walk away from it or\\na last-minute agreement -- was expected this week. google and yahoo\\nannounced their planned partnership in june. they agreed to delay\\nit until early october to give regulators time to review it. since\\nthen, the companies have postponed the start of the deal\\nrepeatedly.\\n\\nnews of the revised proposal was first reported on the web site\\nof the wall street journal.\\n\\nhe is an enormously popular, can-do-no-wrong player in the eyes\\nof his\\nconstituents, who have anointed him as the ultimate counterculture\\nplayer -\\nsuit? necktie? tie shoes? you crazy? - but allen iverson is just a\\nbasketball commodity to the basketball establishment, and now he\\nhas been\\ntraded for a second time in less than two years.\\n\\n\"the answer\" is what his adoring public calls him. well,\\ntoday\\'s\\nquestion is, \"can you win a championship with allen iverson as\\nyour best\\nplayer?\"\\n\\nthus far, the answer is no, and ai is now 33. this means he is\\na) past his\\nphysical peak and b) set in his ways. there is a chance i\\'m wrong\\nabout the\\nfirst one, but there isn\\'t much doubt about the second one.\\n\\niverson has been traded from the denver nuggets to the detroit\\npistons, a\\nteam that needs a change of something. call it change of pace, call\\nit what\\nyou wish, but it was evident by their play against the celtics in\\nthe 2008\\nplayoffs that the window for that core group had closed. a team\\nthat had\\nthe talent and knowledge to win multiple championships was going to\\nhold\\nitself to just one title for reasons the rest of us will never\\nknow.\\n\\nwhat is shocking about this transaction is the sobering thought\\nthat the\\npistons have cold-bloodedly acquired him with a larger idea in\\nmind. can\\nallen iverson deal with the idea that he has not really been\\nbrought to\\nauburn hills to help the pistons win an nba championship, that he\\nis, in\\naddition to being an experienced player of note, that most\\ndesirable of nba\\nitems, an expiring contract?\\n\\noh, the indignity.\\n\\nbut that is the immediate assumption the experts are making.\\ndetroit\\ngeneral manager joe dumars has acquired allen iverson as much for\\nhis\\ncontract as his skill. iverson\\'s $21,937,500 contract is up at the\\nend of\\nthe season. rasheed wallace\\'s $14 million deal will likewise soon\\nbe\\nhistory. dumars is positioning himself for the luscious free agent\\ncrop of\\n2010 that will include lebron james, dwyane wade, chris bosh, amare\\nstoudamire, ray allen, tyson chandler, manu ginobili, richard\\njefferson,\\njoe johnson, tracy mcgrady, yao ming, steve nash, dirk nowitzki,\\nand\\nmichael redd.\\n\\nwow.\\n\\nthis is year 13 for ai, which hardly seems possible, does it? it\\nseems\\nlike yesterday that carmelo travieso and edgar padilla were\\nschooling\\niverson and victor page in the 1996 ncaa eastern regionals down\\nthere in\\natlanta. that was a glorious day for umass, but we all knew iverson\\nwas\\nheaded for nba fame and glory, regardless of what took place in the\\ngeorgia\\ndome that sunday afternoon.\\n\\nbut how will history treat allen iverson?\\n\\nthe barebones are that he is a rookie of the year (1996-97), a\\nthree-time\\nfirst-team all-nba player, a three-time scoring leader, a\\nthree-time steals\\nleader, and an mvp (2000-01). he got to the nba finals once, in\\n2001\\nagainst the lakers, and his 76ers were simply beaten by a better\\nteam. he\\nis a two-time all-star game mvp (2001, 2005), with a high of 35.\\n\\npretty good for 6 feet 1 inch (if that), huh?\\n\\nyes, it is. allen iverson is one of the most intriguing players\\nin the\\nhistory of the nba. there have been little guys equally quick and\\nthere\\nhave been little guys (nate archibald, for example) who could match\\nhis\\nability to both score and pass. but the thing he will be remembered\\nfor is\\nhis sheer physical toughness.\\n\\nthe only players his size i know of who have ever approached\\niverson\\'s\\nfearlessness and ability to play in pain were k.c. jones and norm\\nvan lier,\\nand neither was anywhere near the total ballplayer allen iverson\\nhas been.\\nneither k.c. nor stormin\\' could have led this league in scoring\\neven if\\nthey had been allowed to count all their pregame layups.\\n\\nall of us who love basketball have been thrilled by allen\\niverson\\'s\\nextraordinary tenacity and virtuosity. but the eternal issue with\\nall\\nextraordinary virtuosos in this game, whether they be 7-foot\\nscoring-machine centers such as wilt chamberlain and kareem\\nabdul-jabbar,\\nmidsize do-it-alls such as michael jordan (ok, specifically michael\\njordan), or small multiskilled guards such as archibald, isiah\\nthomas, or\\nallen iverson, is how to blend that dominating talent with the\\nother four\\npeople in order to best help a team win basketball games and,\\neventually,\\nchampionships.\\n\\nit is basketball\\'s great conundrum. a man can indeed have too\\nmuch talent.\\n\\nin iverson\\'s case, the entire package includes a very specific\\npersonal\\nbackground that has shaped him into a very rigid adult. he embraces\\na\\nculture that very often irritates the basketball establishment. it\\npermeates everything he does, from the way he dresses to the way he\\nplays\\nthe game. and being 6-1 is a major problem. the 6-1 player who can\\naffect\\nbasketball in the long run the way the great centers and the great\\nmidsize\\nplayers such as bird, magic, and michael did has not yet been born.\\nas\\ntalented as allen iverson is, there is only so much a 6-1 guy can\\ndo.\\n\\ni\\'m not sure allen iverson will ever be at peace with that\\nconcept.\\n\\nthe fact that he has not won a championship since high school is\\nnot his\\nfault. it is a testament to the game of basketball. pure point\\nguards\\nfitting a specific team need in a given point in time help teams\\nwin\\nchampionships. this is what oscar robertson and tiny archibald did\\nfor the\\n1971 bucks and 1981 celtics, respectively. they were each very\\ntoned-down\\nversions of their career-peak physical selves when they won their\\nrings.\\n\\nbut allen iverson has yet to make that transition.\\n\\ncould he? theoretically, yes. if he did so, could he make\\ndetroit a\\nchampion? i\\'m not sure the pistons are that close, but for the sake\\nof\\nargument, let\\'s say yes, again theoretically. does he have any idea\\nwhat\\ni\\'m talking about? i doubt it.\\n\\ni bet joe dumars doubts it, too. but he\\'s going to enjoy allen\\niverson\\'s\\nexpiring contract.\\n\\nbob ryan is a globe columnist. he can

the european union, the first\\nformer soviet bloc country to lead the group of 470 million\\neuropeans, and during one of the worst economic conflagrations in a\\ncentury.\\n\\nbut instead of welcoming the opportunity for this country of 10\\nmillion to shepherd the world\\'s biggest trading bloc, the fiery\\nczech president, vaclav klaus, has invoked the munich agreement of\\n1938, when the european powers helped to carve up czechoslovakia.\\n\\nhe said in late october that the czech presidency would be\\n\"insignificant\" since europe, now as then, was controlled by\\nfrance, germany, italy and britain. czech politicians, he warned,\\nshould not think they could change anything.\\n\\nlike their central european neighbors, czechs have spent\\ncenturies straddling the continent\\'s east-west divide, pushed and\\npulled between russia and germany or austria. the prospect, come\\njan. 1, of six months at the helm of the european union at a\\nsensitive point in history seems to have brought out national\\nneuroses from the past.\\n\\nthe center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek is\\nteetering badly after huge losses in recent regional elections,\\nprompting alarm that the european union could be led by a\\nrudderless nation.\\n\\nmeanwhile, with russia having flexed a new set of muscles over\\ngeorgia, some european diplomats question whether this nation is up\\nto taming its former master.\\n\\nsome in france, current holder of the presidency, are so alarmed\\nthat officials there have suggested bypassing the czech republic\\nand extending the french presidency into next year.\\n\\nclearly piqued, the czech foreign minister, karel schwarzenberg,\\na pipe-smoking prince, joked that if france did not step aside,\\nthen he would have to challenge nicolas sarkozy, its president, to\\na duel. \"the french and mr. sarkozy do not want to part with being\\nthe president of europe,\" schwarzenberg said during an interview.\\n\\non friday, sarkozy offered a belated pledge of support.\\n\\nthe diplomatic wrangling has echoes of 2003, when former\\ncommunist countries, including the czech republic, supported the\\nu.s.-led war in iraq, prompting jacques chirac, then president of\\nfrance, to remark that they needed to learn to \"shut up.\" europe\\nis more united now, but a new divide nevertheless threatens to\\nemerge, predicated in part on divergent approaches to steering\\neconomic policy during perilous financial times.\\n\\nunder the czechs, some fear a renewed battle over which economic\\nmodel should dominate the european union: the social market economy\\nfavored by its newest members, or the state-controlled economy\\nincreasingly championed by france.\\n\\nwhile sarkozy has earned praise for helping to engineer a speedy\\nbailout of european banks, prague remains deeply wary of state\\nintervention.\\n\\nklaus, an economist by training, recently equated sarkozy\\'s\\nmethods to \"old socialism,\" while topolanek, the prime minister,\\nhas argued that state support for collapsing banks runs counter to\\nthe european union\\'s free market principles.\\n\\nthe czech republic\\'s refusal to embrace the euro, even as its\\npoorer cousin slovakia moves to adopt it in january, has prompted\\nsome observers to argue that a country outside the euro zone is not\\nwell-suited to guide the bloc during a global recession.\\n\\ntomas sedlacek, chief economist at csob, the largest czech bank,\\ncontended that the czech republic would not be the most empathetic\\nleader since the government had pumped cash into faltering czech\\nbanks in the late 1990s, which was now shielding them from the\\nliquidity crisis.\\n\\n\"in a group where everyone has a headache, you don\\'t want to\\nfollow the one guy who says his head feels fine,\" he said.\\n\\nbut schwarzenberg, the foreign minister, argued that the czech\\nrepublic was not immune to the financial crisis, because of deep\\nintegration with the euro zone. more than three-quarters of czech\\nexports go to the european union, while the manufacturing sector in\\nthe country is suffering.\\n\\nas for the contention that the czechs might be ill equipped to\\nguide policy toward the kremlin, schwarzenberg argued that 40 years\\nunder soviet domination had not gone unnoticed.\\n\\n\"we have some experience with the russians,\" he said wryly.\\n\\nczech ambivalence toward the european union stems in part from\\ninstinctive distrust for europe and loyalty to the united states,\\nconditioned during decades of invasion and occupation.\\n\\njan hamacek, a social democrat who heads the foreign affairs\\ncommittee in parliament, said czechs remembered that americans had\\nrescued them, and the rest of europe, three times in the 20th\\ncentury -- in world wars i and ii and during the cold war.\\n\\nmany younger czechs say they are drawn to american values and\\nculture.\\n\\ntomas jirsa, 25, chief of staff for the mayor of prague and an\\navowed conservative, said that while he worshiped ronald reagan,\\nflexible labor markets, maximum personal freedom and the united\\nstates, his french counterparts were in thrall of protectionism,\\nhigher taxes, jobs for life and irrational anti-americanism.\\n\\n\"because of what we experienced with

full day of his\\npresidential campaign. sen. john mccain and his wife, cindy,\\noffered their condolences on monday, saying: \"our thoughts and\\nprayers go out to them as they remember and celebrate

longer.\\n\\nthe company, a private equity firm, said on monday that it was\\ndelaying the purchase of a publicly listed affiliate until next\\nyear, amid the turmoil troubling the markets. kohlberg executives\\nsaid the rescheduling was a result of complications arising from\\nthe merger, which would combine the firm with the affiliate, kkr\\nprivate equity investors, which is traded on the euronext exchange\\nin amsterdam, netherlands.\\n\\n\"the investment thesis for the transaction is solid,\" george\\nr. roberts, a founder of kohlberg, said on a call with analysts on\\nmonday. \"we remain committed to completing the transaction.\"\\n\\nthe news was the latest bump in kohlberg\\'s quest to start\\ntrading in the public markets, a process started at the height of\\nthe private equity boom in july 2007. first, the firm sought an\\ninitial offering, following in the footsteps of fortress investment\\ngroup and the blackstone group. with the credit squeeze, though,\\nkohlberg and its peers have suffered as they have been cut off from\\ndeal-making, the source of their previously lavish profits.\\n\\nlast july, kohlberg said it would go public by acquiring the 88\\npercent of kkr private equity investors that it did not already own\\nand by relisting 21 percent of the combined company\\'s shares on the\\nnew york stock exchange. unlike in the blackstone or fortress\\nofferings, none of kohlberg\\'s top executives will cash out through\\nthe deal.\\n\\nthe affiliate\\'s earnings shed some light on how kohlberg\\'s\\ncompanies are performing, an unusual amount of disclosure for\\nbuyout firms, which are often secretive. the fund, which invests in\\nkohlberg\\'s private equity funds as well as several companies owned\\nby the buyout firm, said its assets\\' value fell 15.3 percent, to\\n$3.87 billion, in the third quarter. the total return for private\\nequity investors for the year through sept. 30 was negative 22.6\\npercent, slightly worse than the standard &amp;amp; poor\\'s 500-stock index\\nor the dow jones industrial average have performed over the same\\nperiod.\\n\\nwhile private equity investors said the value of some\\ninvestments, like its stake in the hospital operator hca, owned by\\nkohlberg, rose, most of its other holdings declined. its investment\\nin bonds of sun microsystems, for example, fell about 11 percent\\nfrom the second quarter, to $511 million. other stakes, mostly in\\neuropean companies, declined in part because of fluctuations in\\nforeign exchange rates.\\n\\nanalysts have grown increasingly concerned that companies owned\\nby buyout firms, which on average carry higher debt burdens, may\\nstruggle more than their peers as the economy worsens. but on the\\nconference call, kohlberg executives said that three-quarters of\\nthe firm\\'s portfolio companies were performing well. furthermore,\\nthe firm\\'s representatives said that many of the companies had\\nflexible terms on their debt repayment.\\n\\nprivate equity investors also said that the value of its\\ninvestment in kohlberg\\'s private equity funds fell. with the\\nexception of its stake in the kkr asian fund, the unit had drops in\\nthe values of its five other investments in its parent\\'s buyout\\nfunds.\\n\\nshares in private equity investors closed at 4.25 euros on\\nmonday, having fallen nearly

declines in sales: 23\\npercent at toyota motor corp; 25 percent at honda motor co; and 33\\npercent at nissan motor co.\\n\\nthe domestic vehicle sales market has been contracting for three\\nyears but october\\'s drop was dramatic, said a statement by mark\\nlaneve, vice president of gm north america vehicle sales, service\\nand marketing.\\n\\nhe attributed the weak numbers to tightened credit

agenda,\" thundered david tieu, a\\n21-year-old deliveryman from brooklyn, as the mayor sat about 15\\nfeet away, staring at him.\\n\\npatrice senior, a nurse from brooklyn, accused bloomberg of\\n\"plantation politics.\" and patti hagan, a writer, decried his\\n\"strong-armed knuckle-busting\" tactics.\\n\\ncustom at city hall has long allowed anyone to appear at a bill\\nsigning and offer an opinion on the legislation being enacted. most\\nsuch ceremonies are sleepy affairs that attract a handful of\\npolitical gadflies.\\n\\nbut on monday, this tidy ritual was turned on its head. for four\\nuninterrupted hours, scores of new yorkers walked up to a\\nmicrophone, looked at bloomberg and rendered a blunt verdict on the\\nlegislation that would allow him to seek a third term.\\n\\nit was a singular moment in the bloomberg era of government. for\\nmuch of his tenure, the mayor has been showered with accolades and\\nsurrounded by friendly crowds that have treated him like a head of\\nstate.\\n\\nbut during the bill signing, a man unaccustomed to direct,\\npublic criticism endured a heavy -- and very harsh -- dose of it from\\nthose he governs.\\n\\ndozens of speakers accused the mayor of arrogantly disregarding\\nthe will of new york voters, who overwhelmingly endorsed the\\ncurrent eight-year term limits in two referendums in the 1990s.\\n\\nthere were many voices of support, too -- from average new\\nyorkers, elected officials and union heads -- and bloomberg appeared\\nrelieved when they spoke of his proven leadership and financial\\nresume.\\n\\n\"you have everything well oiled, and i would like you to sign\\nthis so the people of new york city have a choice to keep you in\\noffice,\" said jill whitaker, a personal assistant in manhattan.\\n\\npatrick j. egan, an assistant professor of politics at new york\\nuniversity, called the legislation extending term limits to 12\\nyears \"a great step for democracy in new york city.\"\\n\\nin all, 137 people spoke -- 68 against the legislation and 65 for\\nit, according to a tally by the new york times. four people did not\\nmake their preferences known. (one man simply brandished a copy of\\nhis resume and asked the billionaire mayor for a job \"with a\\nsix-figure salary.\")\\n\\nbut it was the opponents who brought the most passion -- and raw\\nanger -- to the stately setting. many put their opposition in\\nintensely personal terms, saying that a mayor whom they admired --\\nand had voted for -- had let them down by seeking to circumvent\\nvoters.\\n\\n\"you have exploited the power of your office to overturn the\\nexpress will of the people,\" said judi polson of the upper west\\nside. despite calling herself a bloomberg supporter, polson, a\\nformer wall street executive, vowed to vote against the mayor in\\nthe next race. \"he has lost my vote,\" she told a reporter on her\\nway out.\\n\\nanother bloomberg admirer, michael rosen, told bloomberg he had\\nvoted for him twice, but then pleaded with the mayor not to sign\\nthe legislation.\\n\\n\"please don\\'t make me and countless other parents explain to\\nour children that good men craving power pushed aside the people\\'s\\nvoice,\" he said.\\n\\nthose seeking to derail the legislation, which the city council\\napproved on oct. 23, appealed to the mayor\\'s sense of pride,\\narguing that his legacy would be tarnished by a push to ease term\\nlimits without returning to the voters who created them.\\n\\n\"just ask yourself: how would you like to be remembered in the\\nhistory books?\" said andre calvert, 23, from brooklyn. \"do you\\nreally want to be remembered as a mayor who, along with 29 city\\ncouncil members, overturned the will of the people?\"\\n\\nwhen it was their turn, however, many who favored the\\nlegislation said that voters would have a chance to speak out on\\nterm limits at the polls next year, when bloomberg seeks\\nre-election. most of them cited the fragile economy as a reason for\\nletting bloomberg, a former wall street executive, remain in\\noffice.\\n\\nthe crowd at the bill signing dwarfed any in modern memory, with\\nthe line of those signed up to testify zigzagging across the marble\\nrotunda at city hall by 9 a.m.\\n\\ngeorge arzt, a veteran political consultant who has attended\\ndozens of city hall bill signings over the last 40 years, said that\\n\"there have been controversial items that come up, but nothing in\\nthis realm -- not even close.\"\\n\\nthere were lighter moments, as when jimmy mcmillan, representing\\na political group called the rent is too damn high party, turned\\nhis back to bloomberg as he addressed the mayor, saying the mayor\\nhad turned his back on the people.\\n\\n\"i have no desire to look at you,\" mcmillan said.\\n\\nwhen mcmillan called bloomberg \"a nice guy, a rich guy, a\\ngood-looking man,\" the mayor suppressed a smile.\\n\\nbut mostly, as the parade of speakers stretched into its third\\nhour, bloomberg sat stone-faced, behind a thick wooden table. even\\nthose who angrily opposed the legislation commended his endurance.\\n\\n\"thanks for sitting here,\" said john jiler, a 62-year-old\\nwriter from lower manhattan. \"this must not be easy to you.\"\\n\\nbut in the next breath, jiler tore into the mayor. with the\\npresidential election nearing, he said, his two children, ages 9\\nand 11, were \"so enthralled with the idea that one person can make\\ntheir voice heard throughout the whole planet.\"\\n\\n\"but unfortunately now,\" he said, \"i have to give them lesson\\nno. 2, which is that every so often, a caesar comes along and tries\\nto muffle that voice.\"\\n\\nthe tradition of allowing the public to speak before a bill is\\nsigned dates back at least as far as the 19th century, and\\noccasionally has been known to sway a mayor. once, after hearing\\nhours of fiery testimony in 1897, mayor william l. strong vetoed a\\nbill regulating sidewalk street vendors.\\n\\nabout a half-dozen members of the new york city council sat next\\nto the mayor during the ceremony. but as the testimony dragged on,\\nseveral struggled to pay attention, with one tapping away on his\\nblackberry and another appearing to listen to messages on his cell\\nphone.\\n\\nwhen the testimony was over, around 2 p.m., it was bloomberg\\'s\\nturn to speak. still sitting behind the table, with the room half\\nempty, he said that \"i thought long and hard\" about the issue.\\nafter long opposing any attempt to tweak term limits -- he once\\ncalled the idea \"disgraceful\" -- the mayor said he had decided to\\nreverse himself.\\n\\n\"you know that i have, over a period of time, fundamentally\\nchanged my opinion in terms of how long somebody could be in\\noffice,\" bloomberg said.\\n\\n\"nobody is irreplaceable,\" he said. \"but i do think that if\\nyou take a look at the real world, at how long it takes to do\\nthings,\" he added, and finished the thought, \"i do think that\\nthree terms makes more sense than two.\"\\n\\nwith that, the left-handed bloomberg picked up a black and gold\\npen and, with a flick of his wrist, rewrote new york city\\'s term\\nlimits law.\\n\\ntallahassee  as many as\\n\\n5-million floridians could cast ballots today as the nation\\'s\\nbiggest battleground state renders

long. and today marks the largest group of voters using\\nthe new optical scan machines all at the same time.\\n\\nplus, as many as 10,556 voters could be snared in the state\\'s\\ncontroversial \"no

databases.\\n\\nthe result is lines at polling places and election supervisors\\npredict voting could continue well past 7 p.m. by law, anyone\\nstanding in line when polls close must be allowed to cast a vote,\\nno matter how long it takes.\\n\\n\"there will be lines,\" said orange county supervisor of\\nelections bill cowles in orlando. \"it\\'s important to remember how\\nvoters vote: they

browning advised. \"lines are\\nnot necessarily a sign of something bad or something gone wrong.\\nlines are a sign of a healthy democracy.\"\\n\\nbrowning said he had spoken with gov. charlie

asking him to print enough precinct-marked ballots to\\nguarantee a ballot for every one of the county\\'s record 4.3 million\\nregistered voters.\\n\\nthe advocates made the request after learning that some precinct\\ninspectors only received 800 ballots in precincts with rosters of\\n1,500 voters, a result of logan reportedly only ordering enough\\nballots for 80 percent of the registered

purchase of a publicly listed affiliate until next\\nyear, amid the turmoil troubling the markets. kohlberg executives\\nsaid the rescheduling was a result of complications arising from\\nthe merger, which would combine the firm with the affiliate, kkr\\nprivate equity investors, which is traded on the euronext exchange\\nin amsterdam, netherlands.\\n\\n\"the investment thesis for the transaction is solid,\" george\\nr. roberts, a founder of kohlberg, said on a call with analysts on\\nmonday. \"we remain committed to completing the transaction.\"\\n\\nthe news was the latest bump in kohlberg\\'s quest to start\\ntrading in the public markets, a process started at the height of\\nthe private equity boom in july 2007. first, the firm sought an\\ninitial offering, following in the footsteps of fortress investment\\ngroup and the blackstone group. with the credit squeeze, though,\\nkohlberg and its peers have suffered as they have been cut off from\\ndeal-making, the source of their previously lavish profits.\\n\\nlast july, kohlberg said it would go public by acquiring the 88\\npercent of kkr private equity investors that it did not already own\\nand by relisting 21 percent of the combined company\\'s shares on the\\nnew york stock exchange. unlike in the blackstone or fortress\\nofferings, none of kohlberg\\'s top executives will cash out through\\nthe deal.\\n\\nthe affiliate\\'s earnings shed some light on how kohlberg\\'s\\ncompanies are performing, an unusual amount of disclosure for\\nbuyout firms, which are often secretive. the fund, which invests in\\nkohlberg\\'s private equity funds as well as several companies owned\\nby the buyout firm, said its assets\\' value fell 15.3 percent, to\\n$3.87 billion, in the third quarter. the total return for private\\nequity investors for the year through sept. 30 was negative 22.6\\npercent, slightly worse than the standard &amp;amp; poor\\'s 500-stock index\\nor the dow jones industrial average have performed over the same\\nperiod.\\n\\nwhile private equity investors said the value of some\\ninvestments, like its stake in the hospital operator hca, owned by\\nkohlberg, rose, most of its other holdings declined. its investment\\nin bonds of sun microsystems, for example, fell about 11 percent\\nfrom the second quarter, to $511 million. other stakes, mostly in\\neuropean companies, declined in part because of fluctuations in\\nforeign exchange rates.\\n\\nafter nearly two years of roller-coaster campaigning, a billion\\ndollars in campaign spending, and the most diverse slate of major\\ncandidates ever, this historic presidential election comes to a\\nclose today.\\n\\npolls open in florida at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m.\\n\\ngiven the importance of florida\\'s 27 electoral votes, sens. john\\nmccain and barack obama both hit the state monday for one last\\npitch.\\n\\n\"we will win florida, and we will win this race. there is one\\nday left until we take america in a new direction, my friends. we\\nneed your help and we will win,\" mccain told nearly 1,200\\nsupporters outside raymond james stadium in tampa on monday\\nmorning. \"the pundits may not know it and the democrats may not\\nknow it, but the mac is back. we\\'re going to win this election.\"\\n\\nobama drew more than 7,000 to a rally in jacksonville, a\\nrepublican stronghold that also holds searing symbolism for\\ndemocrats who remember tens of thousands of african-american votes\\ninvalidated in the 2000 election.\\n\\n\"don\\'t believe for a second this election is over,\" the\\nillinois senator said. \"don\\'t think for a minute that power will\\nconcede anything for a minute without a fight. this is going to be\\nclose here in florida. we have to work like our future depends on\\nit in the next 24 hours, because it does. this is about who wants\\nit more.\"\\n\\nthe candidates, their spouses and their running mates roared\\nthrough more than a dozen battleground states, their paths\\nunderscoring the challenge facing mccain. of the seven states where\\nhe campaigned, only pennsylvania went democratic four years ago.\\n\\nobama campaigned in florida, north carolina and virginia, each\\nof which bush won in 2004. until this year, north carolina and\\nvirginia had been safe republican states.\\n\\nin tampa, mccain was joined on stage by gov. charlie crist and\\nsens. mel martinez and joe lieberman, and was introduced by former\\ntampa bay buccaneers fullback mike alstott.\\n\\n\"we can trust john mccain to put his country first because\\nthat\\'s what he\\'s always done,\" said alstott, a registered\\nrepublican.\\n\\nthe arizona senator hammered obama as unready and sure to raise\\ntaxes.\\n\\n\"sen. obama is running to be redistributionist in chief. i am\\nrunning to be commander in chief,\" said mccain, periodically\\ninterrupted by chants of \"nobama!\" and \"usa!\"\\n\\nthe crowd size was not a great sign for mccain, however. on the\\nsunday before the 2004 election, president bush drew nearly 15,000\\nto a rally across the street.\\n\\non monday night at a rally for obama, comedian george lopez\\njoked to a crowd of about 300 at the cuban club in ybor city that\\nhe had thought obama was going to pick him as a running mate, while\\npoking fun at mccain running mate sarah palin.\\n\\n\"i\\'m well qualified, i told obama. i can see mexico from my\\nfront porch,\" lopez joked.\\n\\nthe crowd cheered loudly and waved signs saying \"hispanics for\\nobama. turn florida blue.\"\\n\\nthrough sunday, 358,000 more democrats than republicans had cast\\nballots in florida, but buzz jacobs, mccain\\'s florida campaign\\nmanager, said he is confident the early vote results are stronger\\nfor mccain than many people assume.\\n\\n\"i expect it to be a very long night tuesday. i think it\\'s\\ngoing to be a razor-thin victory for us,\" jacobs said.\\n\\nobama appeared at the jacksonville veterans memorial arena, the\\nsame site where mccain in september declared \"the fundamentals of\\nour economy are strong.\" on monday, obama focused on the economy\\nand his promise that no one earning less than $250,000 a

mccain spent precious last-minute time in\\nnewport news, as sure a sign as any that his campaign believes\\npolls that show sen. barack obama leading. if this republican\\nredoubt flips from red to blue for the first time since 1964, it\\'s\\na sign that mccain is in for a long night.\\n\\ngeorgia: heavy turnout among african-americans could put this\\nrock-solid republican state in play. mccain leads in polls, but\\nit\\'s still a tossup. if mccain wins, he\\'s meeting expectations; if\\nobama wins, this election could be over early.\\n\\nindiana: mccain is scarcely ahead in a state that has a perfect\\ngop voting record since 1964. obama made inroads as a favorite son\\nof neighboring illinois and a win here would be a startling turn\\nagainst the gop.\\n\\npolls close at 7:30 p.m.\\n\\nohio: along with florida and pennsylvania, it\\'s one of three\\ntraditional battleground states. polls show obama leading, but\\nmccain is running hard and ohio is not quite as predisposed to\\ndemocrats as pennsylvania.\\n\\npolls close at 8 p.m.\\n\\nflorida: most of the state\\'s polls close at 7 p.m., but the\\npanhandle time zones are an hour later. it\\'s quite simple: the\\nelectoral math doesn\\'t work for mccain without having florida in\\nhis column. if obama manages to hold on to his lead in the polls\\n(which has been slipping) and captures the state, mccain would have\\nto score an unlikely set of upsets to recover.\\n\\npennsylvania: this rich prize has tilted toward democrats in\\nrecent elections and favors obama strongly in the polls. mccain has\\nnot given up, though, and an upset win here could signal that\\nmccain is drawing blue-collar voters who are important in other key\\nstates like missouri.\\n\\nmissouri: mccain is leading slightly in this swing state that\\nhas voted with the winner every time since 1964. it has been a\\nhistoric bellwether, but the new map that has so many traditionally\\nrepublican states in play means a victory here may be less\\nimportant than it has been.\\n\\npolls close at 8:30 p.m.\\n\\nnorth carolina: polls show a tie, but implications of an obama\\nvictory here would be significant. like virginia, this southern\\nstate is one mccain was expected to win.\\n\\npolls close at 9 p.m.\\n\\ncolorado: democrats held their convention in denver to\\ncapitalize on a trend that had been showing up in recent elections.\\nnow obama is favored to win the state that has gone with a democrat\\nonly one other time since 1964. if so, it could be the first sign\\nthat the gop hold on the west is cracking.\\n\\nmontana: not many votes here, but this state shares colorado\\'s\\nhistory of choosing republicans (except bill clinton in 1992).\\npresident bush carried this state by huge margins both times.\\n\\narizona: mccain leads in his home state but not by much. it\\'s\\nconsidered a tossup. if obama snatches this one, mccain would be in\\na bad, bad spot in terms of electoral votes and embarrassed on top\\nof it.\\n\\npolls close at 10 p.m.\\n\\nnevada: in the last battleground state before the solidly\\ndemocratic west coast, obama leads by an average of 6 points.

foreign agent sent\\nto the united states to cover up his government\\'s role in a\\npolitical scandal involving a cash-stuffed suitcase smuggled into\\nargentina.\\n\\nduring the eight-week trial prosecutors argued that key biscayne\\nresident franklin duran, 41, was working for venezuela\\'s\\nintelligence service when he sought to cover up the secret donation\\nof oil money from the venezuelan government of hugo chavez to the\\ncampaign of argentina\\'s president, cristina fernandez.\\n\\nthe u.s government was initially accused of politicizing the\\ncase in an effort to embarrass chavez, a vocal leftist critic of\\nthe bush administration.\\n\\nopponents of chavez say the case provides valuable insight into\\nhis government\\'s illegal use of income from the country\\'s\\nstate-owned oil company, petroleos de venezuela, or pdvsa, to help\\npolitical allies.\\n\\nthe charges relate to an incident in august 2007 when duran\\'s\\nfriend and business partner, guido antonini, 46, also of key\\nbiscayne, was stopped by a customs agent in argentina after\\narriving on a private jet chartered by pdvsa. he was briefly\\ndetained after almost $800,000 in cash

now, when the hotel business is hurting.\\n\\nbut a hilton hotel in washington, d.c., did just that recently,\\nand then the problem was compounded -- according to both glassman\\nand hilton -- when someone at the company\\'s loyalty program, hilton\\nhhonors, dropped the ball.\\n\\nglassman, a partner in a prominent memphis law firm, was a\\nfrequent hilton customer until late september, when his scheduled\\ntwo-night stay at the hilton washington hotel went astray after he\\ntried to change his arrival date to sept. 27 from sept. 26.\\n\\nglassman said he was prompted to e-mail me after reading a\\ncolumn i wrote a few weeks ago about being hit with a $414.29\\npenalty when i called to cancel a two-night stay at the st. regis,\\na starwood hotel in aspen, colo.\\n\\naccording to glassman\\'s account, which hilton did not dispute, a\\nhotel clerk told him he could not check in on sept. 27 because a\\nlarge group was checking in that day. \"there won\\'t be anyone on\\nthe desk to accommodate you,\" he says he was told.\\n\\n\"i said, \\'let me make sure i understand this. you\\'re saying\\nthat no matter what time i get there, even if i get there at 10\\np.m., you have the room but you won\\'t have any desk people\\navailable to check me in?\"\\'\\n\\ncorrect, the clerk said.\\n\\nglassman decided the clerk was joking. \"i know a couple of guys\\nin hilton corporate, so i said to her, \\'wait, they put an asterisk\\nnext to my name in the computer and told you to do this, right?\"\\'\\nhe recalled.\\n\\n\"excuse me?\" the woman replied.\\n\\ngetting the old offensive, bureaucratic \"excuse me,\" a reply\\nto which there is no known rejoinder, glassman instead called\\nhilton hhonors. but he got nowhere. \"they advised me that they had\\nno control over specific properties,\" he said.\\n\\nwhat glassman did next was cancel all of his existing hilton\\nreservations -- and those of his 21-member law firm as well. and\\nthen he e-mailed me.\\n\\nat hilton\\'s headquarters in beverly hills, calif., adam burke, a\\nsenior vice president who manages hilton hhonors worldwide, had an\\nimmediate reaction when he heard all of this a few days ago.\\n\\n\"gaskets were blown,\" burke said, using the passive voice but\\nmaking it clear that he was the one who blew a gasket.\\n\\njust what a worldwide hotel loyalty program needs -- an unhappy\\nloyal guest who stays frequently at luxury brands.\\n\\n\"my short answer,\" burke told me, \"is that i am concerned.\\nobviously, i would like to make sure we get customer service right\\n100 percent of the time. it seems like we could have handled this\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nburke said that he regarded the matter as a \"training\\nopportunity\" for those down the chain of command who had\\nmishandled glassman\\'s reservation and their supervisors.\\n\\nby the way, i belong to hilton hhonors, among other hotel\\nloyalty programs, and so does my wife, who also travels on\\nbusiness. we\\'re both happy customers.\\n\\nbut it takes only one big foul-up to change that. all right, two\\nin the glassman case. with hotel profits under siege, this is not\\nthe time to be making your most loyal customers unhappy. glassman\\nsays, for example, that he travels about once a week on business.\\n\\n\"it\\'s never more important to get it right than in a down\\ncycle,\" burke said. \"every time we\\'ve seen that cycle in the last\\n20 years, the hhonors members were our core market that sustained\\nthe business.\"\\n\\nglassman is a tough customer who values loyalty but thinks it\\nworks both ways. he and his wife recently canceled reservations to\\nstay at hilton hotels on a trip to syracuse. he says he isn\\'t\\nlooking for amelioration from hilton.\\n\\na hilton hhonors representative called him on monday to\\napologize and assure him the problem would be addressed, he said.\\n\\nhe wasn\\'t moved.\\n\\n\"they said they will miss me.\"\\n\\na report released on monday by a state board\\nfound that gov. sarah palin did not apply improper pressure to try\\nto dismiss a state trooper who was her former brother-in-law and\\ndid not violate state ethics laws in the firing of her public\\nsafety commissioner.\\n\\nthe report by the alaska personnel board contradicts the\\nconclusions last month of a separate inquiry into the matter\\noverseen by a bipartisan legislative panel. the earlier inquiry\\nfound that palin had breached a state ethics act by pressing to\\nhave the trooper, mike wooten, fired. the panel said, however, that\\nthe governor was within her rights to fire the public safety\\ncommissioner, walt monegan.\\n\\nthe personnel board\\'s report, based on an investigation led by\\nan independent counsel, timothy j. petumenos, concluded that there\\nwas no evidence to prove palin or any state employee had acted\\nimproperly in monegan\\'s dismissal.\\n\\nthe report said the legislative inquiry had based its\\nconclusions on an incorrect interpretation of state ethics laws and\\non insufficient evidence. the lawmakers who ordered the first\\ninquiry stood by their report on monday.\\n\\nin a statement about the new report, palin\\'s lawyer, thomas v.\\nvan flein, said, \"the governor is grateful that this investigation\\nhas provided a fair and impartial review of this matter and upholds\\nthe governor\\'s ability to take measures when necessary to ensure\\nthat alaskans have the best possible team working to serve them.\"\\n\\nmonegan has said he believes he was fired because he would not\\nbend to pressure from palin, her husband, todd, and her\\nsubordinates to fire wooten, who had been through a bitter divorce\\nwith the governor\\'s sister. he said that he had received many\\ncomplaints about wooten from the palins and several members of the\\nadministration and that he felt they wanted him to dismiss wooten,\\nwho is still on the force.\\n\\npetumenos said the governor and other state employees had\\ntestified firmly that several conversations monegan described had\\nnot happened. no witnesses confirmed monegan\\'s account of the\\ndiscussions, he said.\\n\\n\"they didn\\'t happen at all,\" petumenos said.\\n\\n\"unless someone can be proved to abuse their power,\" petumenos\\nadded, \"it seems to me they haven\\'t done it.\"\\n\\nmonegan said monday in an interview: \"the conversations\\nabsolutely did take place. i\\'ve been a police officer for some 35\\nyears. aren\\'t i supposed to tell the truth? and in this case i did,\\nunder oath to both investigators.\"\\n\\n\"it\\'s not only me,\" monegan said. \"there were senior members\\nof the department of public safety who got the calls, felt the\\npressure and knew exactly what was going on. i will always feel\\nthat there were conversations and e-mails that were intended to\\ninappropriately use an official government position to settle a\\nfamily matter.\"\\n\\nhe added, \"obviously i\\'m disappointed with the outcome and the\\ncontradictory nature of this investigation, compared to the first\\none.\"\\n\\nthe governor of alaska appoints the members of the alaska\\npersonnel board, though all three of the board\\'s current members\\nwere appointed by palin\\'s predecessor. palin reappointed one member\\nto a new term, said a spokesman for the governor, bill mcallister.\\n\\n\"this is obviously the correct outcome,\" mcallister said. \"we\\nknew all along that governor palin did not abuse her power.\"\\n\\njohn cyr, the executive director of the alaska public safety\\nemployees association, said it was not surprising that a board\\nappointed by the governor\\'s office would reach the conclusion.\\n\\n\"we all knew that the governor\\'s office was putting pressure\\non\" the department of public safety \"to take action against\\nmichael wooten,\" cyr said.\\n\\nin late july, several weeks after monegan was fired, the state\\'s\\nbipartisan legislative council ordered an inquiry into his\\ndismissal. the controversy undercut palin\\'s image as a reformer,\\nbut it did not become prominent nationally until late august, when\\nshe was chosen as the running mate for sen. john mccain, the\\nrepublican presidential nominee.\\n\\npalin had said earlier in the summer that she would cooperate\\nwith the legislative inquiry but, after she was nominated, she\\nrefused to testify. the mccain-palin campaign said the inquiry had\\nbecome politically driven and sent lawyers and staff to alaska to\\nhelp with the governor\\'s legal strategy and to hold \"palin truth\\nsquad\" news conferences almost daily.\\n\\nin september, palin took the unusual step of filing an ethics\\ncomplaint against herself to the personnel board, which she said\\nwas the proper forum for dealing with the matter. the board\\'s\\nreport said it was based on \"substantially more evidence\" than\\nthe legislative inquiry, including a three-hour deposition from\\npalin.\\n\\npetumenos said the legislative inquiry had determined that palin\\nviolated the scope of state ethics laws by \"inaction,\" because\\nshe supposedly did not stop her staff and husband from pressuring\\nmonegan. but petumenos said the legislative inquiry had not met\\nrequirements for finding a violation because it did not cite\\nviolations under specific sections of the ethics code.\\n\\nin the legislative report, the investigator, stephen e.\\nbranchflower, a former prosecutor in anchorage, said that palin had\\nherself applied pressure to get wooten dismissed and also let her\\nhusband and subordinates press for his firing. the report concluded\\nthat she violated the alaska executive branch ethics act.\\n\\nstate sen. kim elton, a democrat who is the chairman of the\\nlegislative council, said of the personnel board\\'s findings: \"i\\'m\\nsurprised. i think the ethics act is very clear and that mr.\\nbranchflower strung together a series of events that

informant who testifies as a government\\nwitness, arguing that with a financial incentive to help build a\\ncase, the informant cannot be trusted. prosecutors, on the other\\nhand, may point out that such payments are necessary because\\ninformants work at great risk and can incur unusual travel and\\nliving expenses while participating in an undercover operation.\\n\\nthere is little question, though, that such payments add to the\\nintrigue of such cases.\\n\\nin the kassar investigation, the government used informants to\\nhelp conduct a sting operation that began a few years ago,

of misconduct by the officers.\\n\\nofficers are often modified in anticipation of possible\\ndisciplinary action.\\n\\nthe reported assault is said to have occurred oct. 15, and a\\nreview of the encounter by the department\\'s internal affairs bureau\\nover the following week failed to find wrongdoing by the officers,\\nwho are from the 71st precinct.\\n\\nbut the investigation has continued, under the auspices of the\\nbrooklyn district attorney, and new evidence and witnesses --\\nincluding a fifth officer, assigned to the transit police -- have\\nemerged. the outlines of the transit officer\\'s account of what took\\nplace in the encounter was relayed last week to investigators, and\\nhis lawyer, paul p. martin, met with prosecutors on monday, martin\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe police and prosecutors have not released much information\\nabout their continuing investigation. they did search a locker in\\nthe 71st precinct station house on monday, one official said, but\\nthe results of the search were unclear.\\n\\none law enforcement official who did not want to be identified\\nbecause he was not authorized to discuss the investigation said the\\naction against the four officers -- alex cruz, noel jugraj, richard\\nkern and andrew morales -- stemmed from information from the transit\\nofficer, who was present during the alleged assault, but who,\\naccording to his lawyer, is being treated as a witness rather than\\nas a target of the investigation.\\n\\nno action has been taken against that officer, who has not been\\nidentified.\\n\\nstuart london, the lawyer for cruz, declined comment; the\\nlawyers for the three other officers did not return telephone\\nmessages.\\n\\non monday afternoon, a police spokesman declined comment, citing\\na grand jury investigation by the brooklyn district attorney,\\ncharles j. hynes. later in the evening, the spokesman, paul j.\\nbrowne, confirmed that the action had been taken against the\\nofficers.\\n\\nin the encounter being investigated, the officers chased a\\n24-year-old man they said they believed was smoking marijuana into\\nthe prospect park subway station. lawyers for the man, michael\\nmineo, a 24-year-old body piercer at a tattoo parlor, said that the\\nofficers tackled mineo and that three held him down while a fourth\\nsodomized him with a piece of equipment.\\n\\nno drugs were found, and the police let him go with a disorderly\\nconduct summons. mineo ended up in a hospital with injuries,\\nincluding a tear to his rectum that one law enforcement official\\nsaid was both external and internal.\\n\\nthe police initially cast doubt on mineo\\'s account, saying in a\\nstatement that the \"assertion that he was sodomized is not\\nsupported by independent civilian witnesses on the scene.\" more\\nrecently, though, the police commissioner, raymond w. kelly, has\\nsaid he welcomed the grand jury investigation by hynes.\\n\\nin placing the officers on modified duty, the department would\\nnot necessarily be suggesting that it accepted mineo\\'s account of\\nbrutality.\\n\\nbut the change would suggest that the department now suspects\\nsome level of misconduct on the part of the officers, either in\\nconnection with the encounter or some other matter.\\n\\nthe law enforcement official pointed out that after the officers\\nsubdued mineo, they checked whether there were any outstanding\\nwarrants against him, finding one stemming from charges in\\npennsylvania. but despite the outstanding warrant, his attempt to\\nflee, his resistance -- according to the police account -- and their\\nbelief that he swallowed a marijuana cigarette, they did not arrest\\nhim, instead issuing him the summons, the most lenient action they\\ncould take against him.\\n\\nin addition, the summons itself was defective, with a return\\ndate in january 2008, which effectively gave mineo a free pass on\\nreturning to court.\\n\\nmartin, the lawyer for the transit officer, declined to provide\\nhis client\\'s name, but said he would meet with hynes\\' prosecutors\\nagain this week. he added that there has been no determination as\\nto whether his client will testify before the grand jury.\\n\\n\"my client is a new york city police officer and he has certain\\nduties and responsibilities that go with his uniform and the oath\\nhe took, and he intends to fulfill his obligations,\" martin said.\\n\\nwashington - president john mccain: it could happen.\\n\\ntrue, the math looks pretty daunting for the arizona senator as\\nvoters head\\nto the polls. on paper, it seems improbable, with democrat barack\\nobama\\nleading in every major national poll, as well as in numerous\\nbattleground\\nstates expected to determine the winner.\\n\\nbut impossible? there have been greater comebacks. the red sox\\nrecovered\\nfrom a three-game deficit in 2004 to win four games straight\\nagainst the\\nyankees, as sox star pitcher curt schilling, a mccain supporter,\\nnoted in\\npeterborough, n.h., on sunday as he stumped with the gop nominee.\\n\\nand while obama has run a relatively error-free campaign,\\npolitical\\nspecialists say, \"almost perfect\" doesn\\'t guarantee the big\\nprize.\\n\\n\"the patriots lost the super bowl,\" noted frank donatelli,\\ndeputy\\ndirector of the republican national committee, referring to the\\nteam\\'s loss\\nto the new york giants in february after a perfect season. as for\\nthe\\npolls, alternately revered and dreaded by the campaigns, donatelli\\nis\\nskeptical.\\n\\n\"everywhere i\\'ve gone, there is just tremendous enthusiasm\"\\nfor mccain,\\ndonatelli said monday in between visits to virginia, pennsylvania,\\nmissouri, and ohio. \"these polls that show a huge disparity\\nbetween\\nrepublican and democratic ((turnout)) are just not going to pan\\nout,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\nanalysts have handicapped the race for obama, predicting he will\\nwin all\\nof the states democrat john kerry took in 2004, plus a combination\\nof\\nvictories in iowa, new mexico, colorado - and possibly virginia and\\nnevada\\n- that would put obama over the 270 electoral majority mark. obama\\nis also\\ncompetitive in florida, north carolina, and ohio, and even once\\nreliably-gop states like montana and georgia are in play. the\\nbattle for\\nmissouri is a dead heat.\\n\\nstill, the races in the battleground states are still quite\\nclose, with\\nobama\\'s numerical edge well within the margin of error. further,\\nmccain has\\nedged up in a couple of polls in north carolina, ohio and\\npennsylvania,\\ngiving republicans hope for a major upset.\\n\\n\"nothing\\'s over until it\\'s over. while polls in a lot of these\\nkey swing\\nstates show obama with slim-to-modest leads, there is always the\\npossibility of late movement in public opinion,\" said michael\\ndimmock,\\nassociate director of the pew research center.\\n\\nmccain would almost certainly have to win pennsylvania and its\\n21 electoral\\nvotes to beat obama, they said. \"there\\'s a mathematical way to do\\nit, but\\nit\\'s an inside straight at best,\" lee miringoff, director of the\\nmarist\\ninstitute for public opinion, said in assessing mccain\\'s challenge.\\n\\nit\\'s possible to come up with arithmetic that would leave the\\nelectoral\\ncollege vote tied at 269 to 269. in that case, the decision would\\ngo to\\ncongress, with the house choosing the president (each state\\'s\\ndelegation\\nwould get one vote) and the senate choosing the vice president.\\n\\nthe votes would be taken in the next congress, and since\\ndemocrats are\\nexpected to expand their majorities in both chambers, obama and\\nsenator joe\\nbiden would probably be sent to the white house, said judith best,\\na\\npolitical science professor at the state university of new york\\ncollege at\\ncortland. but the likelihood of that happening is extremely small,\\nshe\\nsaid.\\n\\nof course, the buffalo bills were losing by 32 points into the\\nthird\\nquarter against the houston oilers in the 1993 afc wild card\\nplayoff game,\\nonly to come back and beat the oilers 41-38, eventually advancing\\nto the\\nsuper bowl.\\n\\nare all those sports comeback scenarios warming the hopes of\\nmccain\\nsupporters? \"we remember those games because quite likely, it will\\nnever\\nhappen again,\" said andrew smith, director of the university of\\nnew\\nhampshire survey center.\\n\\ncleveland - all through the morning yesterday, the line of voters\\nwaiting to\\ncast early ballots stretched almost two city blocks around the\\ncuyahoga\\ncounty board of elections building in what could be a preview of\\nscenes\\nacross the country today of very high turnout for this historic\\npresidential election.\\n\\none prominent forecaster said he believes the turnout percentage\\ncould be\\nthe highest in a century, and election watchers say that could\\ncreate\\nproblems for election officials worried about technology breakdowns\\nand\\nflawed voter lists.\\n\\nbecause of catastrophic problems in the 2000 and 2004\\npresidential\\ncontests, an army of citizen watchdogs has sprung up across the\\ncountry.\\nthey will monitor election day activities, with republican\\npartisans more\\nlikely to be looking for evidence of voting fraud and democratic\\nsympathizers looking to blow the whistle on efforts to intimidate\\nor\\nmislead voters.\\n\\nthe crush of voters descending on about 113,000 polling places\\nnationwide\\non a single day puts great stress on the local officials who\\nconduct\\nelections, and they face some new issues this year.\\n\\n\"just as voting machines were the big problem of 2000 and\\nprovisional\\nballots were a big problem in 2004, the issue of voter registration\\ncould\\nbe the problem this year,\" said daniel tokaji, a professor at the\\nohio\\nstate university school of law. partly, he said, it\\'s because of\\nthe\\nmassive voter registration effort for this election, and the\\nrequirement\\nunder federal law for officials to verify new registrations with\\ncentralized databases such as state motor vehicle departments or\\nthe\\nfederal social security administration.\\n\\nthe issue has produced litigation in ohio, colorado, and\\nwisconsin and\\nraised the possibility that voters who do not come up as a perfect\\nmatch\\ncould be forced at polling places to mark so-called provisional\\nballots,\\nwhich would be examined after election day and might never be\\ncounted. in\\nohio, where there were widespread voting problems in 2004, there\\nwere more\\nprovisional ballots cast than president bush\\'s election-night\\nmargin of\\nvictory over democrat john f. kerry.\\n\\n\"on election day, we start shooting with real ballots, and now\\nwe\\'re on to\\nthe next step of these databases and will find out if these\\nmatching\\nefforts and these lists required in the ((help america vote act of\\n2002))\\nreally work,\" said doug chapin, an election specialist at the\\nnonpartisan\\npew center on the states in washington. \"the real test is what to\\ndo with\\nthese mismatches and what the effect will be on a day when you have\\n100-plus million people voting.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'ve been very vocal about the fact that a state should not\\nstrike\\nsomeone from the voter list just because a computer identifies a\\nmatch or\\ndoesn\\'t identify a match,\" said rosemary rodriguez, chairwoman of\\nthe\\nfederal election assistance commission, an advisory body that was\\ncreated\\nunder the hava law six years ago. \"we\\'ve advised the states that\\neverything should be reviewed by a human to find out, for example,\\nif there\\nare obvious reasons there is not a match.\"\\n\\na prominent turnout forecaster, professor michael mcdonald of\\ngeorge mason\\nuniversity in virginia, said that surges in registration and heavy\\nearly\\nvoting could produce the highest voter turnout percentage in a\\ncentury,\\nsince the election of 1908. mcdonald, who studies early voting\\npatterns,\\nprojects 40 million americans, about 30 percent of all voters who\\nwill vote\\nin this election, will have cast ballots before the polls open\\ntoday -\\neither by mail-in absentee ballots or in-person early voting.\\n\\nwhile that does not always translate into higher turnout,\\nmcdonald believes\\nit will this year, in part, because of the extraordinarily high\\npercentage\\nof votes being cast by african-americans, because democrat barack\\nobama\\ncould become the first black president in history.\\n\\nmcdonald projects that 64 percent of eligible voters will cast\\nballots this\\nyear, exceeding the most recent high of 63.8 percent in 1960, the\\njohn f.\\nkennedy-richard m. nixon contest. four years ago, turnout was 60.1\\npercent\\nof eligible voters. prior to 1960, the previous high was 65.7\\npercent in\\n1908, mcdonald said. in that election, before women could vote,\\nwilliam\\nhoward taft defeated william jennings bryan.\\n\\nwith about 213 million americans eligible to vote this year, a\\n64 percent\\nturnout would mean about 136 million votes cast in the presidential\\nrace,\\ncompared with a 60 percent turnout of eligible voters in 2004 and\\n123\\nmillion votes cast that year, according to mcdonald\\'s united states\\nelections project website.\\n\\nfour years ago, ohio was plagued by voting and tabulation\\nproblems that\\ngained national notoriety after the buckeye state tipped the\\nelectoral\\ncollege to reelect bush.\\n\\ncuyahoga county, the most populous in the perennial battleground\\nstate, has\\nbeen a frequent trouble spot, with a history of mismanaged\\nelections that\\nincluded virtually every possible problem. but the county is\\nstriving to\\navoid errors and a reprise of past electoral embarrassments that\\nincluded\\nequipment errors, slow voting that resulted in court-ordered\\nextensions of\\nvoting hours, and allegations of voter registration fraud.\\n\\nthe cleveland area is one of many across the nation that has had\\nto sort\\nthrough stacks of bogus registration applications collected by the\\nassociation of community organizations for reform now (acorn),\\nactivities\\nthat have precipitated criminal investigations in about a dozen\\nstates. to\\ndate, the cuyahoga election board has referred a dozen\\nacorn-related cases\\nto the county prosecutor\\'s office, mike west, a board spokesman\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe republican party has called it a massive fraud and\\naggressively\\npublicized the cases, and both sides have assembled teams of\\nlawyers in\\nevery state to respond to problems at the polls. in ohio alone,\\nobama\\'s\\ncampaign has 5,000 lawyers standing by today.\\n\\ncuyahoga\\'s stepped-up review methods were on display when the\\nfour-member\\npanel met yesterday and grilled a former resident of a cleveland\\nsuburb,\\nnow working as a toledo television reporter, about discrepancies in\\nher\\nvoting record. her early vote cast in cuyahoga county was nullified\\nafter\\nit was discovered she had also registered and applied for an\\nabsentee\\nballot in lucas county where toledo is located. the board\\nconcluded,\\nhowever, the case did not warrant referral to the prosecutor\\'s\\noffice.\\n\\nthe county, like many voting jurisdictions, has changed its\\nvoting\\ntechnology this year to a paper-based system that uses an optical\\nscanner\\nto count ballot markings. but this is its third voting system in\\nfour years\\nfor cuyahoga after discarding flawed punch-card paper ballots used\\nin the\\n2004 presidential election and a balky touch-screen system used in\\n2006.\\n\\nthe board heard a report from its new director, jane platten,\\nabout the\\nstatus of several thousand questionable ballots already flagged\\nduring\\nearly voting and the other preparations for today\\'s voting,\\nincluding\\nhaving 18 employees present from the vendor that provided the new\\nvoting\\nsystem.\\n\\ndana point, calif. - theo epstein may have been one of the last\\nto arrive\\nat baseball\\'s general managers\\' meetings monday, but it wasn\\'t\\nbecause he\\nwas slacking off.\\n\\nepstein spent the day watching clay buchholz in an arizona fall\\nleague\\ngame, then showed up at the st. regis hotel, where his no. 1\\npriority will\\nbe the red sox\\' catching situation.\\n\\ntoward that end, he will meet with agent scott boras over the\\nnext couple\\nof days to discuss where the team stands in re-signing team captain\\njason\\nvaritek.\\n\\nepstein spoke on a lot of topics upon his arrival, one of which\\nwas the\\nmultiyear extension he reached with the sox - a deal that had been\\nreported\\non for months but without his stamp.\\n\\n\"that\\'s done,\" he said. \"it was taken care of a while back.\"\\n\\nesptein would not reveal the length or financial terms of the\\ndeal but\\ntalked about his reasons for staying on with the sox.\\n\\n\"when you sit back and think about being a general manager,\\nthis is\\nexactly the type of organization you\\'d want to work for,\" he said.\\n\"great\\nfans, great ownership, and a tremendous foundation of our scouting\\nand\\nplayer development, which if we don\\'t screw it up will lead to\\nlong-term\\nsuccess.\\n\\n\"we\\'re all in this game to work with good people and to try and\\nwin a\\nworld series.\"\\n\\nepstein wants to leave the meetings with a good sense of whether\\nhe can\\nre-sign varitek. a couple of executives speculated that there might\\nbe a\\nnew team with interest in varitek: the dodgers.\\n\\nthere is a boston connection in owner frank mccourt, and the\\ndodgers could\\nplay russell martin at third some of the time. another possibility\\nis the\\ntigers, who need a catcher to calm down their pitching staff,\\nthough they\\nmay not be able to afford varitek.\\n\\nepstein said he wasn\\'t opposed to moving quickly on a varitek\\ndecision and\\nhoped to exchange information with boras that could expedite the\\nprocess.\\nbut he also feels the sox are positioned well with depth where they\\ncould\\ngo out and make a deal for a catcher if they had to.\\n\\nepstein said that mike timlin wants to pitch next season, but it\\nwon\\'t be\\nin boston. epstein found it remarkable that timlin spent six\\nseasons with\\nthe red sox.\\n\\nepstein also said he\\'s informed sean casey that the team would\\naddress\\nmore pressing needs, which likely means casey won\\'t be returning.\\n\\nthe sox also appear to be far down the list of jake peavy\\'s\\npreferences\\nfor relocation. the padres are trying to deal him, and san diego gm\\nkevin\\ntowers has been working hard trying to put together a package with\\nthe\\nbraves.\\n\\npeavy, who has a no-trade clause, has indicated that he wants to\\nstay in\\nthe national league, and while he hasn\\'t ruled out boston, it would\\nbe far\\ndown the list after nl teams such as atlanta, houston, los angeles,\\nand\\nchicago.\\n\\nepstein said he would be open to exploring avenues for more\\nstarting\\npitching, but he didn\\'t sound like someone who was going all out\\nfor a cc\\nsabathia or a.j. burnett.\\n\\n\"if it makes sense to us, we\\'d try to add another starter,\" he\\nsaid. \"in\\nan ideal world, sure, the more the merrier. we try to create\\nredundancy at\\nall of our positions. we have some volume now. that can change in a\\nhurry\\nwith a key injury.\\n\\n\"finding value with top free agents is sometimes hard to do.\\nour\\nexpectations are realistic about the chances of landing a guy like\\nthat.\"\\n\\nepstein also indicated the sox are in position to speak to their\\narbitration-eligible players like dustin pedroia, jonathan\\npapelbon, and\\nkevin youkilis about long-term deals.\\n\\n\"i\\'d prefer not to get into the who, what, and where, but\\nthat\\'s one of\\nthe subjects that\\'s on the table,\" epstein said.\\n\\nepstein has never gone to arbitration as a gm in boston, always\\nsettling\\nwith his players. with teams more budget-conscious because of the\\ndownturn\\nin the economy, arbitration may become a more important exercise in\\nthe\\ncoming years. the sox have potential whoppers in papelbon and\\nyoukilis.\\n\\nlast season, phillies first baseman ryan howard won a $10\\nmillion\\narbitration case, the largest one to date, while angels closer\\nfrankie\\nrodriguez lost a bid for $12.5 million and settled for $10 million.\\n\\nboth papelbon, who made $775,000 last season, and youkilis, who\\nearned $3\\nmillion, could see their numbers rise near those levels.\\n\\nuntil now, the sox have not been inclined to work out long-term\\ndeals with\\nthose players, but that thinking could change this offseason. the\\nsox gave\\nyoukilis a raise from $424,000 in 2007 to $3 million in 2008.\\n\\npapelbon suffered a subluxation of his right shoulder in\\nseptember 2006\\nand since then has been on a strict program that outlines when he\\'s\\nable to\\npitch and for how long. the sox went away from that program over\\nthe final\\nmonth of last season and papelbon did admit to feeling \"beat up\"\\nby the\\nend of the playoffs,\\n\\nthe sox seem to be ok with their budget even with the economic\\ndownturn.\\nchairman tom werner, who showed up monday, said of the team\\npayroll, which\\nwas $133 million-plus in 2008, \"we\\'ll do whatever we can to be\\ncompetitive\\nin the tough al east. we\\'ll examine all options to get better,\\ngiven how\\ngood tampa bay has become and will be and with the yankees also\\nlikely to\\nrebuild and be very strong.\"\\n\\nwarner acknowledged that a few sox sponsorships are up and they\\nhave to\\nrenew some business deals, and said he didn\\'t know how the economy\\nwould\\naffect that. but it doesn\\'t sound as if the sox will cut any\\ncorners in\\nbuilding their team.\\n\\nnick cafardo can be reached at cafardo@globe.com\\n\\namid fears of an art-market meltdown, an\\ninternational crowd of dealers, collectors and voyeurs packed\\nsotheby\\'s on monday night for the start of the important fall\\nauction season. while many were expecting a funeral, the results\\nwere spotty: a relief to those who thought the appetite for art was\\nall but dead, but hardly the success story of seasons past.\\n\\nmillions of dollars worth of impressionist and modern art by\\nmasters like degas and picasso, matisse and modigliani went for far\\nless than the expectations. but sotheby\\'s worked hard to make sure\\nits biggest-ticket items and biggest financial risks were covered.\\n\\nearly in the evening, one of the few truly high prices in an\\notherwise tepid evening went for kazimir malevich\\'s \"suprematist\\ncomposition,\" a 1916 abstract canvas of bold blocks and rods of\\ncolors. it brought $60 million, a record price for the artist at\\nauction. but \"suprematist composition\" was bound to sell no\\nmatter what. sotheby\\'s announced several weeks ago that it had\\nlined up what it called an \"irrevocable bid.\" that meant a buyer\\nhad contractually agreed to purchase the painting for an\\nundisclosed sum. on monday night, there was only one bid, which was\\ntaken on the telephone by roberta louckx, a new york-based\\nsotheby\\'s representative who is known to work with russians.\\n\\nit was one of 45 works that sold on monday night. twenty-five\\nothers failed to sell, mostly without a bid. the evening totaled\\n$223.8 million, below its estimate of $337 million to $475 million.\\n\\n(final prices include the commission paid to sotheby\\'s: 25\\npercent of the first $20,000, 20 percent of the next $20,000 to\\n$500,000 and 12 percent of the rest. estimates do not reflect\\ncommissions.)\\n\\nmost of the works that did sell went for prices far below their\\nestimates, which were set in the summer before the financial\\ncrisis. sotheby\\'s spent the past few weeks convincing consigners to\\nlower their expectations. on those works that the auction house had\\ngiven a guarantee -- an undisclosed sum promised to a seller\\nregardless of a sale\\'s outcome -- it was clear that sotheby\\'s was\\nprepared to sell something and lose money rather than risk having\\nto flog it later.\\n\\nmarket jitters have been the talk of the art world for a while\\nnow, but aside from dealers\\' grumbling about how bad business has\\nbecome, there had been few concrete indications until last week.\\nthat\\'s when a 1909 picasso that was estimated at more than $30\\nmillion was abruptly withdrawn from the monday auction. the\\nsellers, heirs of the surrealist painter enrico donati, who died in\\napril, said they were pulling the work \"for private reasons,\" but\\nothers said it was because of fears that the painting would be seen\\nlater as secondhand goods if it failed to sell.\\n\\nin rosier times the painting would have been snapped up by one\\nof the newly rich from the former soviet union, asia or the middle\\neast who have been fueling the market in the last few years. but as\\nthe wealth of these collectors has diminished, the appetite for\\npaying millions of dollars for art has seemed to diminish as well.\\nsotheby\\'s said the buyers on monday were predominantly americans,\\nalthough it was clear that russians also took home several works.\\n\\nmany in the audience were watching to see what new levels would\\nbe set. \"people were nervous,\" said susan seidel, a manhattan\\ndealer, after the sale. \"the mood seemed very tentative.\"\\n\\na degas gouache, \"dancer in repose,\" that was being sold by\\nthe financier henry kravis and his wife, marie-josee kravis, was\\nsought by two telephone bidders. from around 1879, it depicts a\\ndancer sitting on a bench massaging her foot. the kravises bought\\nthe work at sotheby\\'s in london in 1999 for $27.9 million, and in\\nthe summer the auction house gave the kravises a guarantee that\\nexperts said was more than $40 million. on monday yasuaki ishizaka,\\nhead of sotheby\\'s tokyo, took the winning bid by phone: $33\\nmillion, or $37 million including sotheby\\'s fees.\\n\\none of the evening\\'s brightest spots was when \"vampire,\" an\\n1894 munch canvas of a man locked in a tortured embrace, came on\\nthe block. four bidders tried for the painting, and it brought $34\\nmillion ($38.1 million with sotheby\\'s commission).\\n\\nthe evening did see some big casualties. \"seated man (leaning\\non a cane),\" a 1918 painting by modigliani that the nahmad family,\\ndealers with galleries in new york and london, bought at christie\\'s\\nin london in 1996 for $3.2 million, was estimated at $18 million to\\n$25 million. there wasn\\'t a bid in sight, and tobias meyer, the\\nevening\\'s auctioneer, gave up trying to sell the work at $15.5\\nmillion.\\n\\nthe nahmads weren\\'t the only disappointed dealers selling works\\non monday night. another was william acquavella, a manhattan dealer\\nwho purchased giacometti\\'s \"diego\\'s head,\" a 1958 painting, at\\nchristie\\'s just three years ago for $1.1 million. on monday it was\\nestimated to bring $6 million to $8 million. but again, not a hand\\nwent in the air. sotheby\\'s had given acquavella a guarantee that\\nwas said to be about $6 million, making it an expensive mistake for\\nthe auction house.\\n\\na year ago a group of paintings by the russian artist boris\\ndmitrievich grigoriev being sold by the berkshire museum in\\npittsfield, mass., would have been snapped up. but on monday the\\nresults were mixed. among the best was \"pipe players,\" a 1924\\npainting that depicts a pair of peasant musicians. one telephone\\nbidder wanted the painting, and it sold for $2.8 million ($3.2\\nmillion including sotheby\\'s commission), well under its $4 million\\nto $6 million estimate. but \"shepherd of the hills,\" another\\ngrigoriev, this one from 1920, brought $3.2 million ($3.7 million\\nwith commission). it was the only work fetching more than its high\\nestimate, in this case $3.5 million.\\n\\nthe volunteers came armed for work, with shovels, a\\njackhammer and mugs of warm coffee in hand on a brisk fall sunday\\nmorning.\\n\\nnearly two dozen came to break a sweat, get a little dirty and\\nrevel in the feel of a neighborhood brought together through hard\\nwork.\\n\\n\"we were just strangers before, and this made us neighbors,\"\\nsaid doug harper, a sociology professor, still a bit surprised that\\nsomething as simple as planting crab apple trees, hydrangea bushes\\nand day lilies could have such a profound impact.\\n\\ntheir task this day in the middle-class neighborhood of south\\nsquirrel hills was the same as at two previous community planting\\ndays: to expand and beautify an unofficial 2-acre park on\\ncity-owned land along fernwald road. not long ago, it was a\\nweed-choked illegal dump, full of engine blocks, car seats,\\n55-gallon drums and leftover concrete.\\n\\n\"our hope was that if maybe it didn\\'t look like a garbage dump,\\nmaybe people wouldn\\'t treat it like one,\" said dr. john caldwell,\\nan anesthesiologist who is praised by neighbors for doing much of\\nthe day-to-day upkeep and planning for the site.\\n\\nofficials in pittsburgh hope that this kind of self-motivated\\nactivism, which sprang up without city prompting and with minimal\\nofficial support, can become infectious, leading to beautification\\nof a growing number of vacant, abandoned lots.\\n\\n\"i wish i saw more work like that around the city by\\nresidents,\" said guy costa, the city\\'s public works director.\\n\"from what it looked like before, it\\'s amazing what they\\'ve\\ndone.\"\\n\\nbut after the neighbors began improving the park, they realized\\nthey might have a problem on their hands.\\n\\n\"we worried that maybe we had done our job too well and might\\nattract attention,\" said paul peffer, a financial adviser, who is\\nteasingly called \"the mayor\" by his neighbors for starting the\\nproject about eight years ago. \"you know, some developer might\\ncome along and think, \\'hey, i could build there.\"\\'\\n\\npeffer began contacting city officials to see if they could have\\nthe lot designated a greenway to protect their work.\\n\\n\"everyone seemed to agree with the idea immediately,\" he said.\\n\"but we still don\\'t have a designation. you\\'d think the city would\\njump on the idea.\"\\n\\nwhat happened, city officials now say, is that the idea ran into\\nlegal complications.\\n\\nbecause the land had been taken over by the city for delinquent\\ntaxes, officials had to clear up titles and create a new\\nsubdivision that could be designated a greenway -- a

according to a two-page,\\nseven-paragraph letter by her doctor released late monday night.\\n\\nthe letter is the first information the palin campaign has\\nprovided about her medical history. the release of medical records\\nis common practice for presidential and vice presidential\\ncandidates, but earlier this month, palin, the republican nominee\\nfor vice president, declined to provide any health information or\\nbe interviewed about her medical history.\\n\\nshe retreated from that position on oct. 22 in an interview with\\nbrian williams of nbc news. \"if that will allow some curiosity\\nseekers, perhaps, to have one more thing that they can either check\\nthe box off, that they can find something to criticize, perhaps, or\\nto rest them assured over, fine,\" palin said.\\n\\na spokeswoman for palin had said the medical information would\\nbe released a week ago, but the campaign failed to do so.\\n\\nthe mccain-palin campaign e-mailed the statement to the

is from dr. cathy baldwin-johnson, who\\nworks at the providence health and services alaska clinic in\\nanchorage.\\n\\npalin, baldwin-johnson wrote, has been a patient at the clinic\\nsince 1991. she said palin\\'s visits \"have been related to routine\\nwomen\\'s health care and pregnancy.\"\\n\\npalin gave birth to her five children in 1989, 1990, 1994, 2000\\nand 2008. regarding the birth of her fifth child, trig,\\nbaldwin-johnson said palin had \"no risk factors other than her\\nage.\"\\n\\nbaldwin-johnson also wrote that in 1992, palin had a breast\\nbiopsy for a lesion that turned out to be benign. according to the\\nletter, palin is on no routine prescription medications and has no\\ndrug allergies. she is said to work out regularly and to be\\nphysically fit.\\n\\n\"governor

america,\" baldwin-johnson wrote.\\n\\ncolorado springs, colo. -- republican vice presidential nominee\\nsarah palin delivered a patriotic speech to an electrified crowd of\\nabout 3,600 on monday, in the breathless final hours of stumping in\\nthe presidential election.\\n\\nexhilarating her base in this republican stronghold, palin took\\ndemocratic presidential nominee barack obama to task on his\\ndefinition of middle class, his commitment to defense spending and\\nhis pledge to preserve the second amendment.\\n\\npalin, who arrived on stage with her husband, todd, and country\\nmusician hank williams jr., said obama wasn\\'t a moderate democrat\\nbut represented the \"far left wing of the party preparing to take\\nover your federal government.\"\\n\\n\"consider the monopoly of unchecked power,\" she said,\\nreferring to a democratic-controlled congress. she said an obama\\nvictory would bring \"a one-party rule of obama, pelosi and reid.\"\\n\\nthe last day of campaigning brought good news for the alaska\\ngovernor. a report prepared by an independent counsel for the\\nalaska personnel board cleared her of ethics violations in the\\nfiring of her public safety commissioner.\\n\\na state legislative investigation recently said that palin\\nabused her office by allowing her husband and staffers to pressure\\nthe public safety commissioner to fire a state trooper who had gone\\nthrough a bitter divorce from palin\\'s sister.\\n\\nbut the report released monday said, \"there is no probable\\ncause to believe that the governor, or any other state official,\\nviolated the alaska executive ethics act in connection with these\\nmatters,\" the associated press reported.\\n\\npalin\\'s 30-minute speech in an airport hangar was one of many\\ncampaign stops across the country on both sides monday.\\n\\nmany palin supporters, who carried signs that said, \"read my\\nlipstick\" and \"super sarah,\" said they were casting their\\nballots for palin more than for presidential candidate john mccain.\\n\\nat one point during her speech, when people began chanting,\\n\"usa, usa,\" palin began a chant that said, \"john mccain, john\\nmccain.\"\\n\\n\"she\\'s the one, she\\'s the one we\\'re voting for,\" said penny\\nherrmann, a 57-year-old colorado springs resident who attended the\\nrally with her 25-year-old

responding to her speech,\\nsaying no family making less than $250,000 would see a tax increase\\nunder his plan. for families making less than $200,000, it said,\\nthere would be a tax cut.\\n\\npalin said she believed in ronald reagan\\'s brand of politics.\\n\\n\"we believe in the forward movement of your freedom and not the\\nconstant expansion of government,\" she said. \"that

severely\\nburned in a savage attack last year -- and viet ha, who left the\\nsoutheast asian country years ago to start a new life in the u.s.\\n\\nbut long before building up his printing business in chatsworth,\\nha shared a bond with phung\\'s mother and father: all three did\\nbackbreaking work in the vietnamese rice fields.\\n\\nwhen ha read in the daily news that ni na would need a place to\\nstay for a year while doctors at the grossman burn center at\\nsherman oaks hospital work to give her a new face and smile, he\\nimmediately wanted to help.\\n\\n\"i took the article home to my wife,\" recalled ha, who lives\\nwith his family in oak park, northwest of calabasas. \"she cried.\\nwe talked to our children about ni na and it didn\\'t take long\\nbefore we made the call to the children\\'s burn foundation.\"\\n\\nof the eight valley families who offered their homes for phung,\\n18, and her mother for a year, the ha family was selected as the\\nbest fit.\\n\\nwhile phung\\'s father continues to work in the rice fields\\noutside da nang, a port city in central vietnam, her mother will\\naccompany her daughter throughout her stay.\\n\\nlast week, after months of planning and waiting, phung and her\\nmother landed at lax after a 17-hour trip. for more than an hour,\\nha, his wife, kim nguyen, and two of their three children, victor\\nand kevin, waited excitedly at the tom bradley international\\nterminal.\\n\\n\"i\\'m starting to get nervous,\" ha, 48, said as the buildup to\\nseeing phung intensified. \"it\\'s exciting.\"\\n\\nthey tightly gripped their signs, several bouquets of red roses\\nand a new navy blue blanket. they waited while hundreds of\\njet-lagged passengers exited the terminal -- but there was no sign\\nof phung, whose trip was sponsored by the children\\'s burn\\nfoundation in sherman oaks.\\n\\nseventy minutes later, after clearing customs, phung emerged in\\na wheelchair, her mother by her side. the once-pretty young woman\\'s\\nface was covered with a light blue and pink hat and scarf, with\\nonly her brown eyes visible. her host family embraced her warmly,\\nspeaking her language and reassuring her that everything was going\\nto be fine.\\n\\nphung\\'s arrival in southern california follows a long journey of\\nexcruciating pain after she was severely burned and disfigured over\\n70 percent of her body.\\n\\nin march 2007, she attended a party in her hometown with\\nfriends. a neighborhood acquaintance, who had been in a motorcycle\\naccident that doctors said left him mentally unstable, was also\\nthere and asked her out on a date. she declined.\\n\\nthat rejection changed phung\\'s life forever. the young man, who\\nis now serving a 16-year prison sentence, later entered her home\\nand poured gasoline over her body while she lay asleep. then he lit\\nher on fire.\\n\\nwhen phung awakened, her screams could be heard throughout her\\nneighborhood. overcome by pain, she fainted while being taken by\\nambulance to da nang general hospital, where she would begin\\ntreatment for mostly third-degree burns.\\n\\nphung\\'s injuries were so severe that her chin and neck seared\\ntogether. she also lost all the fingers on one hand and was burned\\nover most of her body, which has caused ongoing pain and stiffness\\nthat has gotten worse in the months since the incident.\\n\\n\"i just want to make sure that ni na and her mother are\\ncomfortable and feel good here,\" viet ha said. \"i called them\\nbefore the trip, and ni na sounded good. i asked them what kind of\\nfood they wanted, and they said, \\'rice.\"\\'\\n\\nphung\\'s trip to the united states began several months ago after\\nthe children\\'s burn foundation used its resources to search for the\\nright host family. they needed to find a family that could have\\nphung and her mother stay for about a year and provide meals and\\ntransportation to and from medical appointments.\\n\\nafter phung\\'s story appeared in the daily news earlier this\\nyear, several families contacted the foundation. on sept. 1, ha was\\ntaking a walk in his oak park neighborhood when he saw a newspaper\\non the ground. he picked it up and read phung\\'s story.\\n\\nsince then, ha and his family have been eager to host the burn\\nsurvivor. ni na\\'s mother and father for years have each earned less\\nthan $2 a day working in the rice fields, and her mother had to\\nquit her job to take care of her daughter.\\n\\nviet ha, who also worked in rice fields as a child in his native\\nvietnam, felt that hosting the pair was the right thing to do,\\nespecially since he knows firsthand what it\\'s like to leave vietnam\\nunfamiliar with life in the united states. ha left vietnam alone in\\nhis late teens, but his brothers later joined him.\\n\\n\"i came here with nothing,\" said ha, who worked his way up in\\nthe printing business and now owns victor\\'s contract printing,\\nwhich he named after his son. \"everything that\\'s happened in my\\nlife happened almost by accident and a lot of hard work. i knew we\\nwere the right family for ni na.\"\\n\\nin her first week, phung, who has refused to look at herself in\\na mirror since she was burned, has settled into her new two-story,\\nfive-bedroom home -- a mansion compared with her tiny house in da\\nnang.\\n\\n\"i\\'m ok,\" phung said during her first night in her new home,\\nwhile her mother looked on in their new bedroom.\\n\\nphung\\'s main doctor, alexander majidian, expects her first\\nsurgery to take place in the next few weeks. he hopes to start\\nworking on her neck -- she is having trouble chewing and swallowing\\n-- and give her steroid injections to help her burned skin heal.\\n\\n\"one of the greatest challenges for ni na is developing her\\nconfidence,\" said majidian, who describes the young girl as shy\\nbut enthusiastic.\\n\\nas for ha and his family, their commitment is important, they\\nsaid, because they have been fortunate enough to have good lives in\\nthis country, which once seemed so foreign.\\n\\n\"we couldn\\'t sleep for days before she arrived,\" ha said. \"i\\nknow she\\'ll get better, and we don\\'t want her to go home until\\nshe\\'s fully recovered.\"\\n\\nthe fallout from sunday\\'s 26-17 loss to the miami dolphins\\ncontinued monday when the denver broncos placed running backs\\nmichael pittman and andre hall on the injured-reserve list.\\n\\nthe move left the broncos with just two active tailbacks, selvin\\nyoung and rookie ryan torain, only three days before playing at\\ncleveland on thursday night.\\n\\nyoung has been inactive for the past three games while\\nrecovering from a groin injury. torain made his nfl debut against\\nthe dolphins after spending the past three months rehabilitating a\\ndislocated elbow.\\n\\n\"it\\'s crazy,\" torain said. \"i got healthy just in time.\"\\n\\npittman, the starter in the past three games, aggravated a\\nstinger in his neck during the miami game and was in too much pain\\nto play in the second half. hall, who also has had wrist and ankle\\ninjuries this season, broke a bone in his left hand late in the\\ngame.\\n\\nthe long-term prognosis isn\\'t quite as dire for linebacker d.j.\\nwilliams, who injured the medial collateral ligament in his left\\nknee in the fourth quarter. he is expected to miss at least a month\\nbut will try to return this season.\\n\\n\"i think he\\'s going to fight through,\" said linebacker jamie\\nwinborn, who spoke with williams on monday morning. \"he\\'s going to\\ncome through it, and hopefully he can come through it earlier than\\nexpected.\"\\n\\nstill, williams\\' injury is a major blow to a defense already\\nwithout star cornerback champ bailey and linebacker boss bailey,\\nboth of whom were hurt during the loss to new england on oct. 20.\\n\\n\"obviously we\\'re very concerned,\" coach mike shanahan said of\\nthe rash of injuries.\\n\\nof the litany of miserable sights sunday afternoon at invesco\\nfield at mile high -- jay cutler\\'s three interceptions, an offensive\\npass interference call on brandon marshall, miami running back\\nronnie brown picking up 18 yards on a third-down screen -- perhaps\\nnothing was scarier to the broncos than the sight of williams\\nhobbling on one leg and a pair of crutches in the locker room after\\nthe game.\\n\\nwilliams was injured in the fourth quarter while trying to\\ndefend that miami screen to brown, perhaps the game\\'s key play.\\nwilliams made the tackle that stopped brown 1 yard short of the\\nfirst down, but he remained seated on the grass, surrounded by\\ntrainers and teammates for several minutes before being helped to\\nthe sideline.\\n\\nit surely was an unfamiliar feeling for williams and an unusual\\nsight for his teammates and coaches. williams has been one of the\\nteam\\'s most durable defenders and has played in every game for\\ndenver since the broncos drafted him in the first round in 2004. he\\nhas started at least 14 games in each of his first four seasons.\\n\\n\"d.j. is our warrior, you know?\" linebacker louis green said.\\n\"i never expected d.j. to get hurt.\"\\n\\ngreen and rookie wesley woodyard played in williams\\' absence in\\nthe fourth quarter, and coaches might now reshuffle their\\nlinebackers.\\n\\nwinborn replaced boss bailey on the strong side after bailey was\\nplaced on the injured-reserve list after the loss to new england.\\nwilborn also filled in for bailey there in the preseason and the\\nseason opener. but winborn is naturally a weakside linebacker, and\\nhe started the season as williams\\' backup there.\\n\\ngreen is most comfortable on the strong side, while woodyard,\\nlike williams, is best on the weak side.\\n\\n\"i can play either/or, so it doesn\\'t matter,\" winborn said.\\n\"it just depends on how they want to shuffle us around.\"\\n\\nwill the last star player left on the denver nuggets\\' bench\\nplease inform coach george karl he is running out of excuses why\\nhis underachieving team cannot win in the nba playoffs?\\n\\nunder the duress of player discontent and basketball budget\\nrestrictions, it is nothing short of remarkable denver was able to\\ntrade allen iverson and get hometown hero chauncey billups in\\nreturn.\\n\\nlove him or loathe him, a.i. had to go.\\n\\nnuggets forward carmelo anthony acknowledged monday that his\\npartnership with iverson was no more successful at winning a\\nchampionship than letting baseball superstar alex rodriguez move in\\nwith derek jeter at the house that ruth built.\\n\\nnevertheless, saying goodbye was difficult. \"i\\'m going to miss\\n(a.i.), not only as a friend, but as a basketball player,\" anthony\\nsaid.\\n\\nthe need for this breakup, however, was as obvious as the bad\\nvibe in the dressing room on iverson\\'s last game in a nuggets\\nuniform. everybody knew this probably was his final season in\\ndenver. but why did the team pull the plug on the a.i. experiment\\nso abruptly?\\n\\nto understand, maybe you had to witness the weird, discomforting\\nscene late saturday night after a disheartening loss to the los\\nangeles lakers.\\n\\niverson, normally the most upbeat personality on the team in\\nvictory or defeat, dressed silently in a corner stall, like a sad\\nchild sent to timeout.\\n\\nbut down the hall, a close friend of the 33-year-old point guard\\nspoke angrily on a.i.\\'s behalf and got in the face of a nuggets\\nexecutive to issue a heated complaint about the declining number of\\nshots available to one of the most prolific scorers in nba history.\\n\\na nuggets bench that karl had promised he would rule with an\\niron fist was showing signs of rebellion after only three\\nregular-season games. the scowl on the face of center nene,\\nincredulous at being ignored in the post by teammates after scoring\\n22 points in a victory only 24 hours earlier, was laced with\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n\"i was definitely upset,\" nene said. \"and (lakers forward)\\npau gasol even told me, \\'man, these guys don\\'t pass the ball to\\nyou.\\' \"\\n\\ntrying hard to look the picture of maturity as he pulled a\\nloosely knotted tie over his new corporate haircut, anthony calmly\\nexplained his own failures in the home opener, but as he stood amid\\nteammates, the denver captain was oblivious to the headline news\\nthat would soon shake the ballclub from the core for the second\\ntime since the summer trade of center marcus camby.\\n\\nwhile rumors of an imminent blockbuster between denver and\\ndetroit began leaking over the weekend to such an extent that\\nplayers throughout the league were swapping texts and opinions\\nabout the iverson-for-billups trade, nuggets management kept its\\nyoung franchise star out of the loop, never mentioning it to\\nanthony until the deal was as good as done.\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t hear anything about the trade until i came in\\n(monday) morning. i think that\\'s the most shocking part,\" anthony\\nsaid. \"i\\'m pretty sure that had i known, there would have been a\\nlot more talk.\"\\n\\nthe extreme makeover of the nuggets to a defensive-minded,\\nbasketball-sharing troop of boy scouts seemed doomed to flop as a\\nresult of less than 100 percent acceptance from natural-born\\ngunners, a clash of egos in the locker room and the failure to make\\nanthony, their young franchise player, a full partner in the plan\\'s\\nexecution when the going got tough.\\n\\nso now it is left to billups to lead players he doesn\\'t know and\\nmake karl\\'s idea to reinvent himself actually work.\\n\\nthe trade was advertised as a 3-for-1 swap, with our old pal\\nantonio mcdyess and african import cheikh samb joining billups in\\ndenver. but do not be distracted by the riff or raff. mcdyess left\\ntown in 2002 feeling betrayed, and he ain\\'t coming back.\\n\\nanthony vowed he would make a sales call to mcdyess, asking the\\nsensitive 34-year-old forward to \"come play on my team.\" that\\'s\\nnice. but hearing his pledge, i teased melo, offering to bet 25\\ncents that the next time dice played in denver, it would be wearing\\na visiting uniform, because the nuggets are going to buy out\\nmcdyess\\' contract and let him re-enter the free-agent market.\\n\\nbillups can play \"d\" and hit the 3. billups will drop so many\\ndimes on nene that he will soon wear a $1 million smile. billups\\nfigures to age more gracefully than iverson, whose lack of\\npreparation for this season had become a point of contention in\\ndiscussions behind closed doors with nuggets brass.\\n\\nmaybe best of all, billups can remove some of the coaching\\ndecisions from karl\\'s hands.\\n\\nwhy? karl noted his directorship of players on the floor drops\\nfrom 80 percent to 50 percent involvement with the benefit of a\\ntrue point guard to run the show.\\n\\n\"his instinctive basketball has leadership in it,\" karl said\\nof billups. \"i think the perimeter defense won\\'t have as many\\nholes, as many leaks, as we\\'ve had in the past. and i think he is\\ntough. i look at chauncey, and i see kind of a bulldog.\"\\n\\nbut here\\'s the rub: if the nuggets again fail to win a playoff\\nseries for first time since 1994, who is going to take the blame?\\n\\niverson is gone. karl stays.\\n      camby got shown the door. karl got another chance.\\n      denver cuts payroll. karl keeps collecting a big, fat check.\\n      are we sure the nuggets have solved their no. 1 problem?\\n\\n      mark kiszla is a sports columnist for the denver post.\\n\\nfor the last five years, the detroit pistons\\nwere reliably good, occasionally great and as stable as any team in\\nthe nba. but stability eventually lost its luster, and on monday\\nthe pistons opted instead for spontaneous thrills.\\n\\nin a risky bid to become title contenders again, the pistons\\nacquired allen iverson from denver and sent two mainstays, chauncey\\nbillups and antonio mcdyess, to the nuggets. denver also acquired\\nthe young center cheikh samb in the deal.\\n\\n\"we have been extremely successful for a long time,\" said joe\\ndumars, the pistons\\' president. \"but i also think along with that\\ncomes a little bit of predictability.\"\\n\\niverson, dumars said, will give the pistons \"a different\\ndimension.\"\\n\\nwith a team-first, no-superstar approach, the pistons won the\\nchampionship in 2004 and returned to the finals in 2005. their 284\\nvictories in the past five seasons ranked third in the league. but\\ntheir core group had aged, and the pistons were overtaken by\\nsuperstar-driven teams in miami, cleveland and boston.\\n\\nafter detroit lost to the celtics in the eastern conference\\nfinals last spring, dumars vowed to reshuffle the roster.\\n\\nthe summer came and went without a deal, but he got the call he\\nwas waiting for last thursday. the nuggets were willing to deal\\niverson. after a weekend of negotiations, the teams struck a deal\\nat about 1:45 a.m. on monday.\\n\\n\"some of these deals you have to strike when they\\'re\\npresented,\" dumars said.\\n\\nin iverson, the pistons acquired an explosive scorer, albeit one\\non the downside of his career at 33 and with a checkered\\nreputation. a nine-time all-star, he has averaged 27.7 points in a\\n13-year career. he was the league\\'s most valuable player in 2001,\\nwhen he led the philadelphia 76ers to the finals.\\n\\nbillups, 32, was one of four remaining starters from the\\npistons\\' 2004 title team, and their second-leading scorer for the\\nlast five years. detroit let ben wallace leave as a free agent in\\n2006.\\n\\nrichard hamilton, tayshaun price and rasheed wallace are the\\nstarters left from a unit that was once considered the league\\'s\\nbest. rodney stuckey started in billups\\' place at point guard\\nagainst the charlotte bobcats on monday night, but he will soon\\nhand the reins -- and possibly his no. 3 jersey -- to iverson.\\n\\nthe pistons plan to introduce iverson at a news conference\\ntuesday and expect him to make his debut wednesday in toronto.\\n\\nthe deal left the detroit players shell-shocked.\\n\\n\"do we like the trade?\" wallace asked. \"maybe not. ain\\'t no\\ntelling.\"\\n\\nhamilton, billups\\' backcourt partner for six years, left without\\nspeaking to reporters. prince sounded almost distraught.\\n\\n\"when you\\'ve had six straight years with somebody, you\\'ve got\\nthat bond and connection,\" prince said. \"and now all of a sudden\\nit\\'s gone.\"\\n\\nthere are reports that mcdyess may seek a contract buyout or\\nretire rather than play for the nuggets. if he is waived, he could\\npotentially re-sign with the pistons after a mandated 30-day\\nwaiting period.\\n\\nbillups, a denver native who played at the university of\\ncolorado, will be asked to bring leadership to a young,\\nsometimes-volatile locker room. billups played two seasons for the\\nnuggets early in his career.\\n\\nthe trade has multiple benefits for detroit. iverson\\'s $21.9\\nmillion deal expires after this season. wallace, who is making\\n$13.7 million, is also a free agent next summer. if the iverson\\nexperiment works, dumars can re-sign them both and the pistons\\ncould remain a contender for a few years. if not, dumars can let\\nthem go and become a major player in free agency in 2010, when\\nlebron james, chris bosh and dwyane wade, among others, could be\\navailable.\\n\\ndumars called the cap flexibility a secondary consideration,\\n\"because we wouldn\\'t have made the trade for a player any less\\nthan iverson.\"\\n\\nbeneath a clock counting down the minutes\\nremaining in practice and possibly in his knicks career, stephon\\nmarbury idled as his team, for now, scrimmaged.\\n\\nhe sat, face resting on chin, hardly visible to onlookers or to\\nthe knicks\\' president, donnie walsh, from his sideline seat.\\n\\nhe was out of sight, but hardly out of mind. he was inactive\\nsunday for a second straight game as the knicks lost, 94-86, to the\\nmilwaukee bucks, but he was perhaps active in his own negotiations\\nto solve a festering situation.\\n\\nmarbury, a past source of contention and controversy, is no\\nlonger visible, no longer part of the knicks\\' plans, and he and\\nwalsh met monday in an attempt to find a resolution.\\n\\nmarbury is owed $21.9 million in the final year of his contract,\\nand he has said that he will not accept anything less than his full\\ncontract in a buyout. on monday, he reiterated his refusal to\\nretain an agent.\\n\\nthat steadfastness could make negotiations more complicated for\\nknicks management because no one is directly advising marbury in\\nhis dealings with walsh and, at some point perhaps, james dolan,\\nthe chairman of madison square garden.\\n\\n\"why do i need an agent?\" marbury said. \"i\\'m not waived so i\\ncan\\'t speculate on that right now. i don\\'t need an agent and i\\nwouldn\\'t get an agent. an agent isn\\'t going to tell me, mr. walsh\\nor mr. dolan what to do. they\\'re just going to do the same thing\\nthat i\\'m going to do. and that\\'s talk.\"\\n\\nwalsh said he had spoken with marbury and knicks coach mike\\nd\\'antoni. he refused to put a timetable on a solution, but added\\nthat he expected to do so soon.\\n\\n\"i\\'ve been talking to these guys for days and i\\'m going to keep\\ntalking to them, and hopefully this thing can get resolved,\" walsh\\nsaid. \"we\\'ll get it resolved, but there\\'s no white smoke coming\\nout from the gym or anything like that.\"\\n\\nmeanwhile, billy hunter, the executive director of the national\\nbasketball players association, told bloomberg news that the union\\nmight try to intervene in the stalemate on marbury\\'s behalf to\\n\"see if there\\'s some kind of mutually beneficial position that the\\nparties can arrive at.\"\\n\\nhunter added: \"maybe there\\'s somebody willing to trade for him.\\nmaybe you can do a buyout. it depends on the parties.\"\\n\\nwith the focus on marbury, d\\'antoni noted monday that the knicks\\nhad other problems, including the listlessness displayed in\\nconsecutive defeats after their season-opening win over the miami\\nheat.\\n\\n\"we\\'re going to get through this,\" he said. \"and don\\'t be\\njumping off the bandwagon too quick because that\\'s not the smart\\nthing to do right now, but

presidential race on \"monday night,\" which has\\nbeen alive through 10 elections.\\n\\n\"maybe in the past, there was a desire to keep the election\\nseparate and not turn \\'monday night\\' political,\" said norby\\nwilliamson, an executive vice president of espn, which is in its\\nfirst presidential election cycle with \"monday night.\"\\n\\ntwo members of abc sports\\' former \"monday night\" team said\\nthat in their time it would have been the place of abc news to do\\npresidential interviews.\\n\\n\"abc news obviously would have had first dibs on presidential\\npolitics,\" said fred gaudelli, the former producer, who now\\nproduces nbc\\'s \"sunday night football\" games.\\n\\nal michaels, who called abc\\'s games from 1986 to 2005 before\\nheading to nbc, said, \"abc news had election eve specials, and i\\'m\\nsure they would have wanted to ride herd on something like this.\"\\n\\nwilliamson said that abc news was supportive of espn\\'s\\nmonths-long pursuit of the obama and mccain interviews and offered\\nto promote them on \"world news tonight.\"\\n\\nmccain and obama were not in the espn booth, unlike the\\ncelebrities the network paraded in front of viewers in 2006 and\\n2007 before realizing that the game was more important than\\nchristian slater.\\n\\ninstead, chris berman, working from espn\\'s studios in bristol,\\nconn., interviewed obama first monday afternoon, from jacksonville,\\nfla.\\n\\nberman spoke next with mccain, who was in indianapolis.\\n\\nthe order that they ran, at about 10:10 p.m. eastern, was\\ndetermined during a coin flip by kordell stewart, the former\\nsteeler who is an espn analyst.\\n\\n\"he said, \\'heads, obama; tails, mccain,\\' \" williamson said. it\\ncame up heads.\\n\\nthe interviews were cut into three-minute segments separated by\\na 30-second commercial. berman did not give either man a bermanian\\nnickname, so there was no need to worry about its presidential\\nrespectability.\\n\\nespn, of course, promoted the interviews thusly: \"obama!\\nmccain! boomer!\" imagine a 1960 equivalent, cbs-style: \"kennedy!\\nnixon! uncle walter!\"\\n\\nmccain played espn\\'s game, using a berman phrase to answer the\\nquestion about what he wanted people to think about him as they\\nvoted.\\n\\n\"he. could. go. all. the. way to the white house,\" mccain\\nsaid, moving berman to abandon the sober demeanor he had adopted.\\n\\nboth candidates talked about high school coaches, one who taught\\nobama that \"this isn\\'t about you, it\\'s about the team,\" and one\\nwho guided mccain to appreciate literature and to \"do the\\nhonorable thing even when nobody\\'s looking.\"\\n\\nobama said he advocated a college football playoff (he told\\ngray, jokingly, that it would be \"one of my legislative\\npriorities\"); mccain wants to take \"significant action\" against\\nperformance-enhancing drugs.\\n\\nthis was not obama\\'s first appearance on \"monday night.\" he\\nwas the star of its opening segment two years ago before a chicago\\nbears-st. louis rams game, when he was still teasing the public\\nabout a run for the white house. he spoke somberly to the camera\\nabout critical questions facing america, as if ready to announce\\nhis candidacy. \"i am ready,\" he said, putting a bears cap on his\\nhead, \"for the bears to go all the way, baby.\" then he loudly\\nhummed the first four notes of the \"monday night\" theme.\\n\\nonly one man who has become president, ronald reagan, visited\\nthe \"monday night\" booth. reagan was the governor of california\\nin 1973 when he was spotted in the back of abc\\'s booth talking\\nfootball fundamentals to john lennon, an incongruous sight to any\\nsensate human aware of the men\\'s politics. grasping the moment,\\nhoward cosell told frank gifford to talk to reagan, and, \"i\\'ll\\ntake the beatle.\"\\n\\nan internal review by the american military has\\nfound that a local afghan police chief and another district leader\\nhelped taliban militants carry out an attack on july 13 in which\\nnine u.s. soldiers were killed and a remote american outpost in\\neastern afghanistan was nearly overrun.\\n\\nafghan and american forces had started building the makeshift\\nbase just five days before the attack, and villagers repeatedly\\nwarned the american troops in that time that militants were\\nplotting a strike, the report found. it said that the warnings did\\nnot include details, and that troops never anticipated such a large\\nand well-coordinated attack.\\n\\nthe assault involved some 200 fighters, nearly three times the\\nnumber of the american and afghan forces defending the site.\\n\\nas evidence of collusion between the district police chief and\\nthe taliban, the report cited large stocks of weapons and\\nammunition that were found in the police barracks in the adjacent\\nvillage of wanat after the attackers were repelled. the stocks were\\nmore than the local 20-officer force would be likely to need, and\\nmany of the weapons were dirty and appeared to have been used\\nrecently. the police officers were found dressed in \"crisp, clean\\nnew uniforms,\" the report said, and were acting \"as if nothing\\nout of the ordinary had occurred.\"\\n\\nthe attackers were driven back after a pitched four-hour battle,\\nin which american artillery, warplanes and attack helicopters were\\nultimately called in. still, the militants fought in ways that\\nshowed imaginative military training, if not sophisticated weapons.\\n\\nin the midst of the battle, american soldiers were at times\\nflushed out into the open when they fled what they thought were\\ngrenades, but were in fact rocks thrown by taliban attackers, the\\nreport said. the day before the attack, the militants began flowing\\nwater through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating\\nbackground noise that masked the sounds of the advancing fighters.\\n\\nthe base and a nearby observation post were held by just 48\\namerican troops and 24 afghan soldiers. nine americans died and 27\\nwere injured, most in the first 20 minutes of the fight. four\\nafghan soldiers were also wounded.\\n\\nthe intensity of the attack was so fierce, the report said, that\\namerican soldiers shot at insurgents as close as about 15 yards\\naway, often until their weapons jammed, and at militants who\\nshimmied up trees overhanging their positions to shoot at the\\namericans.\\n\\nthe attack on the outpost, near wanat, caused the worst single\\nloss for the american military in afghanistan since june 2005, and\\none of the worst overall since the invasion in late 2001. it\\nunderscored the vulnerability of american forces in afghanistan, as\\nwell as the continuing problem posed by uncertainties over the\\nloyalties of their afghan allies, especially the afghan police.\\n\\nthe military investigating officer, an army colonel whose\\nidentity was not disclosed in a redacted copy of the report\\nprovided to the new york times, recommended that the police chief\\nand the district governor be replaced, if not arrested.\\n\\nbut the senior american commander in eastern afghanistan, maj.\\ngen. jeffrey j. schloesser, decided after conferring with american\\nforces that relieved the unit, that the district governor had\\nprobably been acting under duress and had been cooperative with\\namerican troops, according to the general\\'s spokeswoman, lt. col.\\nrumi nielson-green.\\n\\nnielson-green said in a telephone interview on monday that while\\nthe governor had been absolved, it was unclear whether the police\\nchief in wanat was complicit.\\n\\na spokesman for afghan defense ministry officials said the\\namericans had never discussed these complaints with them.\\n\\nhajji abdul halim, deputy governor at the time of the wanat\\nattack, and now the acting governor of nearby nuristan province,\\nsaid monday that both officials had been detained briefly and then\\nreleased.\\n\\n\"we suspected them after the incident, but the american forces\\nreleased the district governor after two days of custody,\" he said\\nin a telephone interview.\\n\\nthe report, which was completed on aug. 13 and declassified in\\nrecent days to allow military officials to brief family members of\\nthose who were killed, did not assign blame to any commanders of\\nthe unit involved -- the 2nd battalion, 503rd infantry regiment,\\n173rd airborne brigade combat team -- a unit that was in the final\\ndays of a 15-month deployment when the attack took place.\\n\\n\"the actions by leaders at all levels were based upon sound\\nmilitary analysis, proper risk mitigation and for the right\\nreasons,\" the report said.\\n\\nit concluded that despite reports earlier in july that 200 to\\n300 militants had been massing to attack another remote outpost in\\nthe same vicinity, the commanders at wanat had no reason to expect\\nsuch a large frontal assault.\\n\\n\"the enemy normally conducts probing attacks prior to\\nconducting an all-out, large-scale attack,\" the report said,\\nquoting the investigating officer as concluding that it \"was\\nlogical\" to think that an initial probing attack would involve\\nonly about 20 militants seeking to gauge defenses and the reaction\\nof american and afghan forces.\\n\\nhowever, the report criticized the \"incredible amount of time\"\\n-- 10 months -- it took the nato military authorities to negotiate\\narrangements over the site of the outpost, giving adversaries\\nplenty of time \"to plan coordinated and complex attacks.\"\\n\\nsome details of the attack have been described in recent months\\nby publications including the new york times, the army times and\\nvanity fair. but the 44-page report offers the most extensive\\naccount so far. at the time of the attack, american and afghan\\nforces were still building fortifications of sandbags and earthen\\nbarriers around the main outpost and a small observation post about\\n100 yards away. in some places, those troops were protected only by\\nstrands of concertina wire and a ring of gun-mounted, armored\\nhumvees, the report said.\\n\\nthe militants apparently detected the vulnerability and moved to\\nexploit it. on the evening of july 12, the militants slipped into\\nthe village, undetected by the americans, ordered the villagers to\\nleave and set up firing positions inside houses and a mosque.\\n\\nat 4:20 a.m. on july 13, the militants struck with a fusillade\\nof heavy machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades, destroying\\nthe americans\\' most potent weapons: 120-mm mortars and a tow\\nmissile launcher.\\n\\nat the same time, the militants blasted the observation post\\nwith rifle fire and more grenades. within 20 minutes, all nine\\namericans inside were dead or wounded.\\n\\nthree times, teams of soldiers from the main base ran a gantlet\\nof hostile fire to resupply the observation post and carry back the\\ndead and wounded. within 30 minutes, american fighter-bombers were\\nblasting the militant positions, followed by apache helicopter\\ngunships.\\n\\njust days after the attack, american forces abandoned the\\noutpost at wanat, but nielson-green said the military continued to\\npatrol in the region from a larger base four miles away.\\n\\n\"this was a complex attack carried out by militants who clearly\\nknew the terrain and maintained radio silence,\" he said.\\n\\nelection day will bring an end to the negative political\\nadvertising that has inundated the country. but it will not mean an\\nend to negative advertising.\\n\\nthat is because marketers of consumer products, borrowing a page\\nfrom the electoral playbook, are becoming more willing to run\\naggressive ads in which brands attack their competitors by name. a\\nmajor reason for the growing popularity of such ads is the\\nfaltering economy, on the theory that when times are hard, you\\nshould hit your opponent harder.\\n\\n\"it\\'s very tactical, it\\'s very short-term, but today marketers\\nare thinking short-term,\" said david melancon, the chief executive\\nof the ito partnership, a brand identity consulting company in new\\nyork.\\n\\nthe spin doctors on madison avenue describe the tactic as\\n\"comparative advertising\" rather than going negative. but the\\nintent is the same as in politics: build yourself up by tearing\\nyour rival down.\\n\\n\"we wanted consumers to know our coffee is better-tasting than\\nthe perceived coffee leader\\'s,\" said frances allen, brand\\nmarketing officer at the dunkin\\' donuts division of dunkin\\' brands\\nin canton, mass. her reference was to a campaign that began on oct.\\n20, centered on a taste test in which the respondents said they\\npreferred the coffee served at dunkin\\' donuts to the coffee sold by\\nstarbucks.\\n\\neven the name of the web site created for the campaign is\\ncombative: dunkinbeatstarbucks.com. visitors to the site can send\\nfriends e-cards bearing statements like \"friends don\\'t let friends\\ndrink starbucks\" and similarly puckish greetings.\\n\\n\"all we\\'re trying to do is a little bit of disruptive\\nmarketing,\" allen said. the campaign promoting the taste test is\\ncreated by hill, holliday, connors, cosmopulos in boston, part of\\nthe interpublic group of companies.\\n\\nother examples of negative product pitches include a\\nlong-running campaign from apple that mercilessly mocks the pc\\noperating systems sold by microsoft; a campaign from the fox\\nbusiness channel cable network, which derides jim cramer of cnbc;\\nads for burger king that take on other fast-food chains like\\nmcdonald\\'s and wendy\\'s; and a campaign for a new variety of\\ncampbell\\'s soup, select harvest, that berates progresso for selling\\nsoups with ingredients like monosodium glutamate.\\n\\n\"we\\'re pleased with what we\\'re seeing\" since the select\\nharvest campaign began, said john faulkner, a spokesman for\\ncampbell soup co. in camden, n.j. \"the early interest from\\nconsumers has been terrific.\"\\n\\nthe campaign, created by bbdo worldwide in new york, part of the\\nomnicom group, includes print ads that show a variety of progresso\\nchicken noodle soup under the headline \"made with msg\" next to a\\nsimilar variety of select harvest under the headline \"made with\\ntlc.\"\\n\\nsome negative ads, like the select harvest campaign, generate\\nresponse ads from the targets in which they defend themselves or\\neven counterattack. the point and counterpoint takes on a\\ntit-for-tat quality reminiscent of a presidential campaign -- or a\\nplayground fight.\\n\\n\"we take our brand equity very seriously,\" said mark addicks,\\nsenior vice president and chief marketing officer at general mills\\nin minneapolis, the parent of progresso, which has replied to the\\nattack ads from campbell with two sets of ads.\\n\\none set is focused on how progresso plans to remove monosodium\\nglutamate from its recipes. the other set describes a taste test\\nbetween the varieties of progresso and select harvest chicken\\nnoodle soups that are featured in the select harvest campaign.\\nprogresso, needless to say, comes out ahead this time.\\n\\nboth sets of progresso ads are created by saatchi &amp;amp; saatchi in\\nnew york, part of the publicis groupe.\\n\\nafter more than two years of pounding from apple, with a\\ncampaign that portrays the pc as geeky and the macintosh as cool,\\nmicrosoft corp. responded in september with $300 million worth of\\nads that embrace the apple phrase \"i\\'m a pc.\" the microsoft\\nriposte, by crispin porter &amp;amp; bogusky in miami and boulder, colo.,\\npart of mdc partners, seeks to turn the apple negatives into\\npositives.\\n\\n\"they\\'ve made a caricature out of the pc,\" said david webster,\\ngeneral manager for brand marketing at microsoft in redmond, wash.\\n\"if they want to have a conversation about the fake pc, we want to\\nhave a conversation about the real pc.\"\\n\\n\"when they start making claims about our products, that\\'s\\nfrustrating,\" he added. \"but you don\\'t start advertising\\ncampaigns out of frustration.\"\\n\\ncampaigns that take such a tack run the risk of being perceived\\nas overly negative, a judgment that can hurt a brand as much as it\\ncan a political candidate.\\n\\na report called the consumer pulse check, released last month by\\nmullen in wenham, mass., another agency owned by interpublic, found\\nthat shoppers \"are tired of feeling downbeat\" and \"want brands\\nthat make them feel good.\"\\n\\nin other words, brands that attack other brands run the risk of\\ntarnishing their images. \"if i define my brand by my competitor\\'s\\nbrand, i had better get out some information about my brand at the\\nsame time,\" melancon at ito partnership said, or the campaign can\\nbe deemed unfair or pejorative.\\n\\none way to avoid that is by leavening a negative ad with humor.\\n\\n\"it was very much a question of how do you do this without\\nturning people off,\" said tim cawley, a senior vice president and\\ngroup creative director at hill, holliday who worked on the dunkin\\'\\ndonuts campaign.\\n\\nthe answer, he said, was to present a scientist who improbably\\nfollows coffee drinkers to their work places to administer the\\ntaste test so they \"can cram it into their busy day.\"\\n\\nof course, to a marketer being attacked by name by a competitor,\\nads softened with humor are still no laughing matter.\\n\\n\"at this time, given what the country is going through, people\\nare looking for great experiences and good value,\" said a\\nspokesman for starbucks in seattle, vivek varma.\\n\\n\"lots of companies run comparative campaigns, but the effective\\nones need to be credible and authentic,\" he added. \"if the data\\nis wrong or your tone is off, or if you are pitching a message out\\nof touch with what consumers generally regard, you may be creating\\nopportunity for your intended competitor.\"\\n\\nin other words, an ad from dunkin\\' donuts that challenges\\nstarbucks in a way consumers consider inappropriate could redound\\nto the benefit of starbucks.\\n\\nto followers of political advertising -- particularly\\npresidential ads in 2008 -- that may be a suggestion to wake up and\\nsmell the coffee.\\n\\nmainland china\\'s top negotiator on taiwan matters\\nbegan negotiating in taipei on tuesday over transportation and\\neconomic issues with his taiwanese counterpart, signaling a further\\nwarming of relations between the governments.\\n\\nthe chinese official, chen yunlin, is the highest ranking\\nmainland official to visit the island since the end of the civil\\nwar in 1949. his delegation and taiwanese officials are engaging in\\nfive days of talks intended to reach agreements on flights,\\nshipping and related matters.\\n\\nchen, the chief of the association for relations across the\\ntaiwan strait, landed at the taipei airport on monday and went to\\nthe historic grand hotel, where he made a few remarks to a crowd of\\nreporters. \"the step is not easy and is a crystallization of the\\njoint efforts of many compatriots across the strait,\" chen said,\\naccording to xinhua, mainland china\\'s state-run news agency.\\n\\nhe had dinner with chiang pin-kung, the chairman of the straits\\nexchange foundation, the main negotiator for taiwan, and on tuesday\\nmorning their formal talks began.\\n\\nnegotiators for their governments met in june in beijing after a\\nlong hiatus and signed a deal to start regular weekend charter\\nflights between mainland and taiwanese cities. the meeting took\\nplace shortly after the inauguration of president ma ying-jeou of\\ntaiwan, who was elected in march after promising to improve the\\neconomy and relations with the mainland.\\n\\nbut ma\\'s popularity has sagged in recent months. taiwan\\'s\\neconomic performance has been lackluster, and many taiwanese\\ncitizens say ma and his party, the kuomintang, are moving taiwan\\ninto mainland china\\'s orbit too quickly.\\n\\nprotests against ma\\'s china policies by the democratic\\nprogressive party, the main opposition party, have been fierce. on\\noct. 21, protests took place when zhang mingqing, the vice chairman\\nof the mainland\\'s negotiating body, toured taiwan. zhang was shoved\\nto the ground by a local politician while visiting the confucius\\ntemple in the southern city of tainan, an opposition party\\nstronghold.\\n\\nduring chen\\'s visit, the government is deploying 10,000 security\\nofficers, according to the kuomintang\\'s news agency.\\n\\nthe chinese communist party sees taiwan as a rebel province that\\nmust be brought back into the fold. taiwan split from china in\\n1949, when the kuomintang sought refuge on the island after losing\\nthe chinese civil war. many taiwanese prefer to maintain the\\ncurrent status quo of de facto independence, and some, especially\\nmembers of the democratic progressive party, advocate formal\\nindependence.\\n\\nchen, the mainland negotiator, and chiang are expected to sign\\nagreements that increase the charter flight schedule to every other\\nday and open maritime shipping lanes. they are also expected to\\ndiscuss economic cooperation as a way to fight the global financial\\ncrisis.\\n\\n\"it is imperative that the two sides join to help each other to\\ncope,\" chen said monday, according to xinhua.\\n\\nchen has also said the mainland is again offering to give two\\npandas to taiwan, a move that the beijing government first made in\\n2005 that was rejected by taiwan\\'s last president. ma has indicated\\nthat he would accept the pandas.\\n\\nthere is rampant speculation in both china and taiwan over\\nwhether chen and ma will meet. if so, this is the big question:\\nwill chen address ma as zongtong, or president, thus acknowledging\\nthat ma holds a title that in international affairs is usually\\naccorded only to the head of a sovereign nation?\\n\\nsome 90 years before lincoln freed the slaves, lord dunmore, last\\nroyal governor of virginia, issued his own emancipation\\nproclamation--with a catch: bear arms with us against the upstart\\ncolonists, he pledged, and england will grant you freedom.\\n\\nas a result, hundreds of slaves risked hardship and death to join\\nlord dunmore\\'s royal ethiopian regiment. although some found\\nfreedom, the \"liberty to slaves\" slogan emblazoned on their\\nuniforms lost its luster amid their miserable, pox-ridden existence\\noff the coast of virginia.\\n\\nfrom this obscure slice of revolutionary history, m.t. \"tobin\"\\nanderson has crafted a meaty and provocative conclusion to his\\nmonumental two-part novel, \"the astonishing life of octavian\\nnothing, traitor to the nation.\"\\n\\nthe first installment, \"the pox party,\" won the 2006 national\\nbook award. the second part, \"kingdom of the waves\" (candlewick,\\n$22.99), continues a coming-of-age story that mines the paradoxes\\nof our national birth. its exploration of racial identity and\\ndestiny feels especially timely in this historic election season.\\n\\n\"it just seemed to me,\" said anderson, who grew up steeped in\\nrevolutionary mythology, \"that this was the most astounding kind\\nof american story.\"\\n\\ntotalling nearly 1,000 pages, the two-part novel is hugely\\nambitious, and not just because of its scope.\\n\\nstylistically, it\\'s a tribute to the ornate syntax and elevated\\nphrasing of 18th-century prose, replete with phrases such as\\n\"reason enthroned in the pillowed seraglio of the brain.\"\\n\\nremarkably, it\\'s written for teens--and it\\'s a prime example of a\\ntrend toward greater heft in young adult literature, once a\\nwasteland of frothy fare.\\n\\njohn green, the only writer to have been recognized twice by the\\namerican library association\\'s printz committee, professes awe for\\nanderson.\\n\\n\"i think he is america\\'s greatest young novelist--for any\\naudience,\" green said. \"there hasn\\'t been anyone like tobin,\\never.\"\\n\\nfor his part, anderson said, \"i just felt very committed to this\\nidea of being part of this movement for true literature for teens,\\nas opposed to simply books written for teens. i just felt it would\\nbe very cool to do this thing that pulled no punches.\"\\n\\nif \"octavian\" poses a challenge for young readers, writing it was\\na labor of hercules for anderson, whose earlier titles--including\\n\"burger wuss,\" \"feed\" and \"whales on stilts!\"--had more of a\\npop-culture sensibility.\\n\\nthe research demands were so taxing, anderson left his teaching job\\nat vermont college to immerse himself in octavian\\'s universe.\\n\\n\"for the 5 1/2 years it took me to write the thing,\" he said, \"i\\ntried to only read 18th-century texts, or books about the 18th\\ncentury or books they would have read in the 18th century. so that\\nmeans, like, greek and latin things, which, i should add\"--he\\nlaughed--\"i read in translation.\"\\n\\nanderson said it was critical to wear octavian\\'s antiquarian\\nlanguage like a second skin because \"in order to get inside the\\nmindset of a period, i feel like you have to also enter into its\\nlanguage.\\n\\nanderson, who turns 40 on election day, is the son of an episcopal\\npriest (his mother) and a computer-company manager. his\\nbreakthrough novel was shaped by his childhood in stow, mass., a\\nboston-area town with a rich revolutionary war legacy.\\n\\n\"the first battles of the revolution were fought by men from the\\ntown where i grew up,\" he said. \"when i was a kid, my parents\\nwould take me to all these re-enactments. it always seemed to me\\nthat the history didn\\'t feel distant to us there. instead, it\\nseemed very intimate.\"\\n\\nanderson said he couldn\\'t help but wonder which side he would have\\njoined--the patriots or the loyalists--had he lived during that\\nera, with no sense of the outcome.\\n\\n\"we can look at the revolution in hindsight,\" he said, \"and\\neverything seems very clearly laid out and very pure of motive.\\n\\n\"instead, if you start to say, \\'what was it like to be in the\\nmidst of that massive, national uncertainty and all of those moral\\nquestions swirling around,\\' then to me that becomes an interesting\\nstory.\"\\n\\nanderson thickened the broth with elements of two intriguing\\nhistoric events. \"volume i: the pox party\" explores octavian\\'s\\nprivileged childhood at the novanglian college of lucidity near\\nboston, where he receives a classical education and believes\\nhimself a prince. only in adolescence does octavian realize the\\ngothic horror of his situation: he has been the subject of an\\n\"insane enlightenment experiment\" to gauge the capabilities of\\nthe african race.\\n\\nsuch an experiment did, in fact, take place at anderson\\'s alma\\nmater, cambridge university, where the duke of montague oversaw the\\neducation of a jamaican youth named francis williams to test, as\\none historian wrote, whether \"a negroe might not be found as\\ncapable of literature as a white person.\" williams ended up a\\nclassical poet.\\n\\n\"it just seemed to me,\" anderson said, \"that this was a very\\ncreepy, powerful image.\"\\n\\nin \"volume ii: kingdom on the waves,\" anderson places octavian\\nin lord dunmore\\'s royal ethiopian regiment--a perfect setup to\\nexplore the paradox of white patriots demanding liberty even as\\nthey enslaved blacks. (we also learn that lord dunmore, moved by\\nexpediency, was no hero.)\\n\\n\"the story of lord dunmore\\'s royal ethiopian regiment is one\\nthat\\'s almost never discussed, by anyone,\" anderson said. \"here\\nyou have these people struggling to define themselves and so\\nexcited by the idea of liberty--because they, of course, had so\\nmuch more to lose in the cause of liberty than their white\\ncounterparts. i thought, \\'this is an amazing story, if i could only\\ntell it.\"\\'\\n\\nwith the u.s. possibly electing its first black president, it\\'s\\nimpossible to read \"octavian\" without wondering what it says\\nabout our progress as a nation.\\n\\nanderson said that, while a barack obama victory could change\\nunconscious perceptions about african-americans--which would be\\n\"tremendously wonderful\"--nothing can undo the past.\\n\\nit\\'s more important, he said, to consider what we\\'re doing today\\nthat future generations will judge as \"monstrous and\\nhypocritical.\" our impact on the environment and the debt we\\'re\\nleaving our children give him pause.\\n\\nhe predicts historians will say, \"at this stage in history,\\namericans had a huge investment in ignoring the effects of how they\\nlived their daily lives.\"\\n\\ndepending on whom you speak with -- and believe -- the knicks are\\neither turning the page or beginning a new chapter of absurdity.\\n\\nmy vote is for absurdity. it centers once again on stephon\\nmarbury, the veteran point guard with whom the organization appears\\nto be locked in a fatal embrace. the new coach, mike d\\'antoni, has\\nsent a clear message that marbury will not be part of the team\\'s\\npresent or future.\\n\\ndonnie walsh, the team\\'s president of basketball operations,\\nhinted monday that while the knicks are pining to get rid of\\nmarbury, he -- if not his coach -- is entertaining the idea of\\nplaying him.\\n\\ngranted, in this drama of spy and counter spy, who knows the\\ntruth? the knicks want to get value for marbury and know they can\\'t\\ndo it if he\\'s sitting on the bench in street clothes. it\\'s in the\\nknicks\\' interest to tout marbury\\'s attributes -- how he came to camp\\nin the best shape of his life and even agreed to play off the\\nbench.\\n\\n\"i think he can play in this style,\" walsh, referring to\\nd\\'antoni\\'s frenetic offense, said monday after watching practice.\\n\"i think that what mike is trying to do is play younger guys, but\\non the way to that i think stephon can be helpful. that\\'s what i\\'ve\\ngot to find out.\"\\n\\nthe scene at practice was bizarre. as the knicks scrimmaged and\\nd\\'antoni coached, marbury, in full practice attire, leaned against\\nthe basket support, watching intently. walsh sat on a folding chair\\nabout 20 yards away. i wondered if this scene seemed as bizarre to\\nwalsh as it did to the rest of us?\\n\\n\"let me put it this way,\" he said. \"this is an unusual\\nsituation. i have to talk to steph. i don\\'t want to see him just\\nsitting there. he\\'s a player. i think we have to have some\\ndirection as to how he\\'s going to be played. that\\'s how i feel.\"\\n\\nin fact, walsh suggested he was surprised by the current events\\nthat have marbury in limbo as a seemingly permanent fixture on the\\nteam\\'s inactive list.\\n\\n\"steph was playing, coming off the bench,\" walsh recalled.\\n\"he said he was fine coming off the bench. and then all of a\\nsudden, the first game he didn\\'t play, then that chant and\\neverything was in there.\"\\n\\nhe was referring to the \"we want steph\" chorus on opening\\nnight at madison square garden and again on sunday.\\n\\n\"then the next game i think it was a mutual agreement between\\nsteph and mike that it was becoming a distraction with so

there still a grudge between d\\'antoni and marbury from their\\ntime together in phoenix?\\n\\n\"i don\\'t get that feeling from mike,\" walsh said. \"i don\\'t\\nget the feeling that mike doesn\\'t

going to do.\"\\n\\neveryone -- including marbury -- realizes that his knicks career\\nis over. on the surface, the stalemate revolves around the $21.9\\nmillion that the knicks owe on the final year of his contract.\\nmarbury, who operates without an agent, refuses to entertain a\\nbuyout that would pay him a penny less.\\n\\nnothing crazy about that, especially for the knicks, who eat bad\\ncontracts like jelly beans.\\n\\nwalsh said he did not consider making such an offer.\\n\\n\"i wouldn\\'t go to him with that, because i wouldn\\'t take it,\"\\nwalsh said. \"i never did go to him, ever. i wouldn\\'t do that in\\nthis situation.\"\\n\\nthe source of the conundrum is that while d\\'antoni wants to get\\nrid of the vestiges of the previous management, walsh wants value\\nfor marbury who, at 31, is still the team\\'s most talented player.\\nwalsh doesn\\'t simply want to waive marbury without getting so much\\nas a jump shot out of the deal.\\n\\nthe stalemate is so bizarre that the nba players association\\noffered monday to intervene and possibly assist marbury in any\\nnegotiations.\\n\\n\"quite honestly, i\\'ve never done that before,\" walsh said.\\n\"i\\'ve never just said -- particularly to a very talented player,\\n\\'oh, ok -- goodbye.\"\\'\\n\\nmarbury can still play; his talent has been the siren song for a\\nmultitude of coaches at virtually every

by roger clemens against\\nhis former trainer, brian mcnamee. at issue is whether mcnamee was\\nimmune from such actions, and, if he was not, whether the case\\nshould be tried in texas.\\n\\nu.s. district court judge keith ellison, who has been\\nconsidering these points for several months, called the hearing to\\ndiscuss with the lawyers their motions for and against dismissing\\nthe case. the judge said he was \"agonizing over these claims\" and\\nrealized the repercussions of his decision would be felt beyond his\\ncourtroom.\\n\\nmcnamee\\'s lawyer, richard emery, argued that under terms of an\\nimmunity agreement, his client was compelled by the department of\\njustice and the federal bureau of investigation to disclose to\\nformer sen. george j. mitchell that he had injected clemens with\\nperformance-enhancing drugs.\\n\\n\"fbi agents requested that he meet with mitchell and tell him\\nthe same things he had told them,\" emery said. \"he did that under\\nclear threat of further proceedings against him.\"\\n\\nmitchell was commissioned by major league baseball to\\ninvestigate the use of performance-enhancing substances in the\\nsport. he released a widely distributed report last december in\\nwhich clemens was identified, along with numerous other current and\\nformer players, as having used steroids and human growth hormone, a\\ncharge clemens denies.\\n\\nlara hollingsworth of houston, an associate of clemens\\' lawyer,\\nrusty hardin, countered that the \"mere presence of the fbi in the\\nroom\" when mcnamee met with mitchell was not enough to \"confer\\nimmunity.\"\\n\\nof mitchell, she said, \"we are talking about a private\\nindividual doing a private investigation for a private client.\"\\nmoreover, she said there was no indication that mcnamee\\'s testimony\\n\"furthered the government\\'s cause\" in prosecuting drug users,\\nwhich would be the basis for granting immunity.\\n\\nduring the proceedings, which neither mcnamee nor clemens\\nattended, both legal teams also quarreled over jurisdiction. emery\\nsaid texas was not the appropriate venue because mcnamee \"was not\\nconscious of texas\" when he made his claims but \"was talking of\\nmatters that took place in toronto, florida and new york.\"\\n\\nrestating language in briefs already filed with the court,\\nhollingsworth said texas was \"where roger clemens built his\\nreputation and where his continuing business interests are and\\nwhere he will feel the most harm.\"\\n\\nellison did not indicate when he might rule on whether the case\\ncan proceed to the discovery phase, during which emery has promised\\nto subpoena women with whom clemens has reportedly had affairs.\\n\\noutside the courtroom, emery noted that he had paid his own way\\nto houston and described mcnamee as \"broke and trying to eke out a\\nliving in queens to support his family.\"\\n\\nserena williams found herself far from the united states and\\ntuesday\\'s presidential

vote,\\nbut that did not mean she had no stake in the outcome on nov. 4. as\\na prominent african-american, she said she was moved by the\\npossibility of an african-american like barack obama becoming\\npresident.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t really get involved in political affairs because of\\nthe way i was brought up and being a jehovah\\'s witness, but it\\'s\\nexciting to see someone like barack

\"it\\nwould have been nice,\" she said.\\n\\nbriefly back at no. 1 in september after her u.s. open victory,\\nwilliams quickly surrendered that position to jelena jankovic. she\\ndropped to no. 3 after playing one singles match in the last eight\\nweeks.\\n\\n\"well, obviously i do want to be the best, and i do want to be\\nno. 1,\" williams said. \"and quite frankly, everyone thinks i am\\nanyway. so you know i never correct them. i just let them believe\\nwhat really should be.\"\\n\\nwilliams is 2-1 this year against jankovic, who has yet to win a\\ngrand slam singles title. \"she\\'s been playing very consistently\\nall year, and she plays every week, so i guess in this tour if you\\nplay every week you have a chance of being no. 1,\" williams said.\\n\"my goal is to win

venus, 28, are still\\nplaying, unlike retired rivals like martina hingis, justine henin\\nand kim clijsters.\\n\\nand in this egalitarian season when, in the wake of henin\\'s\\nsurprising retirement, four women played catch with the top\\nranking, williams had the best record in big events. she reached\\nthe quarterfinals at the australian open, the final at wimbledon\\nand won in new york after winning an olympic gold medal in doubles\\nwith venus in beijing.\\n\\nit was not quite 2002, when she dominated the game. but this was\\na reassuring, relatively consistent performance from williams, who\\nwas ranked outside the top 100 in 2006 and wondering if her fragile\\nleft knee would let her rise again.\\n\\nwilliams\\' 43 victories this season are the second-highest total\\nof her career after 2002. and she still has the season-ending\\nchampionships, which bring together the world\\'s top eight players\\nand are in doha for the first time.\\n\\n\"that was my goal, to be more consistent, to play more\\ntournaments,\" she said. \"i love playing tennis and love the\\ncompetition and love being out there. my goal at the beginning of\\nthe year was just to be happy every time i go out there and just\\nplay, and that was what i pretty much did this whole year.\"\\n\\nthe one exception was the french open, in which she labored to\\nkeep the ball in the court and was upset in the third round by\\nkatarina srebotnik.\\n\\n\"coming up to paris, i think everyone expected me to win, as\\nwell as myself, and i just crashed and burned,\" she said. \"i was\\nso disappointed after. i don\\'t even think i can describe in words\\nhow disappointed i was.\"\\n\\nasked for the emotional highlight of her season, williams did\\nnot hesitate, and the answer was not winning the u.s. open, where\\nshe leaped and then staggered around the court in delight.\\n\"definitely the olympics, definitely hands down,\" she said. \"i\\njust was looking at my gold medal

williams, possible after the bye week,\\nwas merely a feel-good story until the run of injuries at running\\nback.\\n\\nstarting tailback earnest graham was forced to leave sunday\\'s\\n30-27 overtime win at kansas city with a knee injury but finished\\nthe game. backup warrick dunn didn\\'t even make the trip because of\\na pinched nerve in his back. fullback b.j. askew has missed six\\ngames with a hamstring strain.\\n\\nno wonder gruden took the unprecedented step of giving players\\nseven days off from practice.\\n\\n\"it\\'s going to help us,\" gruden said of the bye week.\\n\"obviously our running back situation in particular is very\\nconcerning to us. both fullbacks, both halfbacks. carnell williams\\nwill get a chance to work in this week a little bit more, and we\\'ll\\ndetermine his progress next week. but we\\'ve got a number of guys\\nthat are nicked up and guys that we need back. hopefully this week\\nwill help us.\"\\n\\ngraham, the bucs\\' leading rusher with 560 yards and four\\ntouchdowns, has taken hits as a ballcarrier and at fullback. he has\\nfilled in for askew and byron storer, who was placed on injured\\nreserve after tearing his right acl against carolina.\\n\\n\"i think he got hurt early in the game,\" gruden said of\\ngraham. \"he went to the locker room; trainers looked at him.\\ncourageously, he came out and played in the second half.

that\\'s what you do with your best players.  we got\\nto lean on our guy and he\\'s our only healthy, versatile back going\\ninto the game, so that was our plan (sunday). unfortunately, we\\nfell behind and we obviously had to get into a little bit of a\\nthrow-it mentality late in the game.\"\\n\\ngraham rushed 19 times for 62 yards and threw his first nfl\\ntouchdown against the chiefs. and he lost two fumbles. with dunn\\ninactive, the bucs did not make much use of michael bennett, who\\nhad two carries for 1 yard.\\n\\nbut the bucs got some help from clifton smith, the undrafted\\nrookie free agent from fresno state who had a 97-yard kickoff\\nreturn. while graham was undergoing tests, smith pitched in with\\nthree carries for 17 yards and caught one pass (though he also lost\\na fumble).\\n\\n\"he really helped us not only in the kicking game but from\\nscrimmage,\" gruden said. \"earnest went out in the first half and\\nmissed a few possessions, came back and

his third 100-yard game of the season (115 yards,\\neight catches) sunday and has positioned himself among the league\\nleaders at his position.\\n\\nand to think, bryant is still in his first season with the bucs\\nand spent 2007 away from football. could he be just warming up?\\n\\n\"i felt really comfortable,\" bryant said. \"everything is\\nstarting to be like second nature, like i\\'ve been here before.\"\\n\\nthe closest he has been to this  a featured receiver making huge\\nplays  was his 1,009-yard season for the browns in 2005.\\n\\ngoing into monday\\'s redskins-steelers game, bryant was tied for\\nninth in the nfl in receptions (45) and 13th in yards (566). what\\'s\\nmore important are his big plays. against the bears on sept. 21,\\nhis 38-yard catch in overtime positioned the bucs for the winning\\nfield goal. and against the chiefs on sunday, his 24-yard td\\nreception helped force overtime, where the bucs eventually won.\\n\\n\"he was a superstar,\" coach

in the presidential election. but if small-business owners\\nin the united states think they have it bad, they should talk to\\njohn banwell.\\n\\nbanwell owns a cleaning business in weymouth, a seaside town in\\nsouthern england. he recently contacted his bank to renew his\\n20,000 pound overdraft -- a $31,800 short-term line of credit -- only\\nto learn the interest rate had almost doubled.\\n\\nbanwell tried to tell the manager of his hsbc bank branch that\\nhe needed the money to pay his four employees and his bills while\\nhe waited for customers to pay him. he received a written apology,\\nsaying there was nothing the bank could do about his rate, which\\nhad risen to 7 percent above prime.\\n\\nbanwell was able to borrow the money from a friend instead, but\\nthat did not solve his long-term problem: how to keep his business\\nalive as credit tightens in the middle of an economic downturn.\\n\"fuel and material costs have gone up and we\\'ll have to increase\\nour prices, but i\\'m afraid it may erode sales,\" banwell said.\\n\"money definitely should be made available where needed.\"\\n\\nthe economic downturn is making life tougher for businesses of\\nall sizes. but britain, famously called \"a nation of\\nshopkeepers,\" has a special place in its heart for small business.\\nand banwell\\'s experience is at the heart of a battle that has\\nerupted between representatives of small businesses and the\\ngovernment over how much help small firms should receive as the\\ncountry enters its first recession in 17 years.\\n\\nbacked by a strong business lobby, the opposition conservative\\nparty and the nation\\'s two biggest tabloid newspapers, small\\nbusinesses are demanding cheaper credit and tax breaks after a\\nmultibillion-pound government bank bailout failed to immediately\\nfree up credit.\\n\\nthough small businesses account for more than half of britain\\'s\\ngross domestic product and employ more than 13 million, their plea\\nis controversial. they face, arguably, the same problems of higher\\nborrowing costs and declining consumer spending that afflict larger\\nrivals.\\n\\nsome analysts said smaller businesses were more vulnerable to a\\ndownturn because they depended more on financing. \"a large company\\nhas more options to raise money,\" said philip shaw, chief\\neconomist at investec securities in london. but others said smaller\\nfirms were actually at an advantage because they were more flexible\\nand could adapt better to slowing demand.\\n\\nthat may be true, but small businesses say they are feeling the\\npinch as banks introduce charges for processing overdraft\\napplications, increase their fees for managing accounts or request\\nadditional collateral for loans, according to the british chambers\\nof commerce.\\n\\nthe changes are a result of higher interbank lending rates, a\\ndeteriorating economic outlook and the banks\\' more conservative\\nattitude toward risk.\\n\\nthe british government tried to free up credit by making its\\nbailout of royal bank of scotland, lloyds tsb and hbos this month\\ndependent on the banks\\' returning to \"2007 levels\" of lending to\\nsmall businesses.\\n\\nthe chancellor of the exchequer, alistair darling, met with\\nexecutives of other major british banks last week to persuade them\\nto reduce borrowing costs for smaller businesses. instead of\\nfreeing up lending, the entreaties led to criticism by some\\ninvestors that the government was repeating the mistake it made\\nduring the boom: encouraging borrowing.\\n\\n\"businesses are anticipating banks will be supportive,\\nreflecting the support they have received themselves,\" neill\\nthomas, head of debt advisory at kpmg in london, said. but \"the\\nreality for companies is the tap remains blocked. we expect only a\\ntrickle of liquidity to return to debt markets in the period\\nthrough to christmas.\"\\n\\nthat would be bad news for many of britain\\'s 4.7 million small\\nbusinesses, and it would infuriate those that helped turn small\\nbusinesses from net borrowers to net depositors over the last 17\\nyears. smaller companies now keep 1.48 billion pounds with their\\nbanks, making them one of the biggest group of depositors.\\n\\none of them is william n. mullings, who runs a small jewelry\\nstore in london founded by his family in 1798. he is upset that the\\ngovernment bailed out the banks, which are now still reluctant to\\nlend. \"if you are running a business, any business, you should be\\nable to do so without the help of the government,\" mullings said.\\n\\nhigher borrowing costs are not the only problem for smaller\\nbusinesses. they also struggle as customers increasingly fall\\nbehind with payments, sometimes up to several months. late payments\\ncan be a matter of life and death for smaller businesses.\\n\\nthe issue has started to threaten the labor party\\'s\\ntraditionally cozy relationship with small business and has moved\\nsmall businesses into the center of a lively political debate about\\neconomic competence between britain\\'s two major parties.\\n\\nthe government is keen to be seen as a supporter of small\\nbusinesses because they are perceived as \"struggling, small and\\nhard-working,\" said robert a. blackburn, professor of\\nsmall-business studies at kingston university in london. \"there\\nare a lot of votes in small businesses and there is a realization\\nthat this is quite a powerful group of people,\" said blackburn.\\n\\nit is also widely believed that it will be small businesses that\\nwill lead britain out of recession. \"people running britain\\'s\\nsmall businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,\" the\\ngovernment\\'s secretary for business, peter mandelson, said.\\n\\nthe popularity of prime minister gordon brown has already taken\\na hit because many voters blame him for creating the\\nborrowing-and-spending boom during his time as chancellor of the\\nexchequer that is now pushing the economy into recession.\\n\\nthe government pledged to pay its own bills to smaller\\nbusinesses in no more than 10 days but david cameron, the leader of\\nthe opposition conservative party, called for more drastic steps.\\nin a letter to the sun newspaper, cameron suggested that small\\nbusinesses be allowed to delay their value-added tax payments to\\nthe authorities, and be given a cut in some tax rates, to help them\\ncope with \"the economic downturn made in britain and designed by\\ngordon brown.\"\\n\\ndemands by the federation of small businesses went even further,\\nincluding a 1 billion pound rescue fund for small businesses backed\\nby the european investment bank, and a policy of publicly naming\\ncustomers who pay late.\\n\\nat his cleaning shop in the south of england, banwell seemed to\\ntake a pragmatic approach: \"i have no problem with having to\\ntighten the belt and don\\'t think banks should be forced to lend\\nmore -- they are businesses too -- but the belt-tightening needs to\\nbe evenly spread.\"\\n\\nthe mets are seeking bullpen help in every\\nshape and form possible. the third-place yankees want starting\\npitching, and probably a good deal of it. so it was of little\\nsurprise that both of those needs helped create a little bit of\\nbuzz as this week\\'s gathering of general managers got under way in\\nthe posh setting of the st. regis hotel, a place fancy enough to\\nlet player agents fantasize about big free-agent contracts even if\\nthe national economy is a mess.\\n\\nfirst came the mets. in a short interview with reporters in the\\nhotel lobby, the agent for the left-handed closer brian fuentes\\nsaid that the mets were indeed one of the teams interested in\\nsigning the 33-year-old fuentes. the agent, rick thurman, said that\\none of his partners at the beverly hills sports council had already\\nbeen in contact with mets general manager omar minaya and that both\\nsides were expected to meet in person later on monday.\\n\\n\"i think he would be great in new york, he really thrives under\\nthe pressure,\" thurman said of fuentes, who had a 2.73 earned run\\naverage for colorado this past season, with 30 saves in 34 chances.\\n\\nminaya left little doubt about what he would look to do this\\noff-season. \"our problem at the end of the year when we lost billy\\nwas that we weren\\'t able to hold the games,\" he said, referring to\\nthe injury to closer billy wagner. \"our offense certainly wasn\\'t\\nthe problem.\"\\n\\nas is usually the case, just about every team in baseball is in\\nneed of bullpen help. thurman said he planned on speaking with\\nrepresentatives of the los angeles angels, the cleveland indians\\nand the detroit tigers, among others, about signing fuentes.\\n\\nstill, fuentes is likely to be considerably less expensive than\\nthe top closer on the market, francisco rodriguez, who may be\\nlooking for a contract that will pay him as much as $75 million\\nover five years. in 2008, rodriguez, 26, had a major league-record\\n62 saves, and a 2.24 era.\\n\\n\"if you look at his numbers this year, compared to k-rod\\'s\\nnumbers, they are very similar in some areas and better in\\nothers,\" thurman said of fuentes while using rodriguez\\'s nickname.\\n\"he\\'s definitely a better value.\"\\n\\nso the spinning had begun, with a full winter still ahead.\\n\\nmeanwhile, yankees general manager brian cashman met with a\\nsmall group of reporters in his hotel suite. in a scene unlikely to\\nbe duplicated in the new yankee stadium, cashman took off his\\nsandals, sat on the floor with his legs crossed and discussed what\\nhe believed was the team\\'s most pressing need: starting pitchers.\\n\"i just know we need starting pitching and it\\'s not going to just\\nbe one,\" cashman said. \"we won\\'t be one and done; it will be\\nmultiple.\"\\n\\ncashman said that right now he was counting on only chien-ming\\nwang and joba chamberlain to be in the team\\'s rotation next season.\\nwang and chamberlain are coming off injuries, and chamberlain will\\nprobably have his innings limited next season because he did not\\npitch all that many in 2008. there is still a chance that mike\\nmussina, coming off his first 20-victory season at age 39, will\\ndecide to put off retirement and pitch at least one more year in\\nthe bronx. andy pettitte, a free agent like mussina, appears\\ninterested in returning.\\n\\nbut even if pettitte and mussina come back, the yankees will\\nneed at least one more pitcher. at the top of their list is c.c.\\nsabathia, the left-hander who pitched the milwaukee brewers into\\nthe postseason but is now likely to head elsewhere, possibly for a\\ncontract in the $150 million range. the brewers made a formal offer\\nto sabathia on saturday but are considered a long shot to sign him\\nbecause they are a small-market and the yankees and perhaps others\\nare certain to outbid them.\\n\\ncashman also said that johnny damon would probably be the team\\'s\\nstarting left fielder and leadoff hitter next season. who will play\\ncenter is still a question.\\n\\n\"but the priority is starting pitching,\" cashman said.\\n\\non the day after the new york city marathon, the\\nroadway in central park was still a special place, almost a shrine,\\nto the millions of feet that have padded through.\\n\\nmoving gingerly but proudly, runners dressed in comfortable\\nclothing returned to the park monday to have their pictures taken\\nin front of the finish line they had crossed a day earlier. i heard\\njapanese, italian, spanish, french, the international sound of the\\nmarathon. noisy drills were being used to take apart the temporary\\nsteel bleachers that are erected for that one afternoon a year.\\n\\nthe runners holding up their medals had no reason to know that\\ntwo of the 37,899 runners who passed this way sometime sunday\\nafternoon had died shortly afterward.\\n\\n\"two of our athletes did not return home,\" mary wittenberg,\\nthe race director and president of the new york road runners,\\nannounced, visibly moved, at the day-after news conference. the\\nroad runners, the race organizer, would not disclose the names of\\nthe runners, out of deference to their families, but wittenberg\\'s\\nshaken presence told everybody that there had been a death in the\\nroad runners\\' family, too.\\n\\n\"i was talking to a doctor last night,\" wittenberg said later\\nin a private interview. \"she said that every person is given a\\ncard,\" suggesting a gift card with an unknown quantity in it.\\n\\nwittenberg, who won the marine corps marathon in 1987 and a year\\nlater ran in the u.s. olympic marathon trials, said that runners\\ncould work up to marathon length or just run shorter distances, and\\nthat running was good for the health of almost everybody who runs.\\n\\n\"but everyone\\'s life is a significant loss,\" she added.\\n\\nmany, many others will apply to run next year, as the marathon\\ncontinues to test just how far it can grow. when it began in 1970,\\nit was a quaint little race around central park, turning the 127\\nrunners into virtual hamsters on a wheel, but since 1976 it has\\ntaken in the five boroughs.\\n\\nto a nonrunner, the marathon does not seem appreciably different\\nover the past quarter-century -- out to staten island in the\\ndarkness, a tour of the boroughs, a finish in central park.\\n\\nthe biggest difference, wittenberg said, is the $18.2 million\\nraised for charity this year, with more expected in the next few\\nweeks. in the old days, the marathon had not evolved to charitable\\ncauses.\\n\\nthe current size of the race is already putting stress on the\\ncrowded streets of the old city. the mass of runners went off in\\nthree waves this year for the first time. wittenberg said the road\\nrunners would study the results, but she admitted that the club did\\nnot think it had stopped expanding.\\n\\nwittenberg added that parts of the course could not stand a\\ngreater bulge of runners: for example, the right turn by the\\nbrooklyn academy of music, around the eighth mile. the organizers\\ndo not want their runners picked off, like basketball players\\nrunning into a tile pillar in some old church basement gym. in a\\ntime of abrupt change, the marathon needs its landmarks.\\n\\nnext year there will be new baseball stadiums in the bronx and\\nqueens -- maybe good business, maybe not, depending on whose taxes\\nare being used, and whose parkland is being gobbled up, and what\\nhappens to the wonderful corporations now being subsidized by you\\nand me. but changing the route of a race is trickier.\\n\\nthe tour de france changes its course every year, putting stages\\nin municipalities willing to pay for the traveling circus. next\\nyear, for the very first time, the tour will send cyclists up a\\nformidable mountain on the final saturday, the last day of real\\ncompetition. could the marathon do the same thing by arranging a\\nrun out to coney island one year, a detour to van cortlandt park\\nthe next? it\\'s hard to imagine the city rejiggering its logistics\\nand informing spectators, who now head for the barricades out of\\nhabit.\\n\\nwhat about separate days for men and women? the city could never\\nshut down twice or produce the same enthusiasm twice in a year, and\\nthe weather could shift from brilliant to miserable. the marathon\\nneeds to be an equal-opportunity spectacle.\\n\\nwittenberg knows that. asked how big the marathon could become,\\nshe tossed out the number 45,000, depending on staggered waves, as\\nlong as the runners did not step on one another\\'s toes in the\\nchutes.\\n\\nthe race should always end in the park, near the statue of its\\nfounding father, fred lebow, which is moved every year from its\\nregular spot on the east side. on monday, lebow\\'s statue was still\\nover on the west side, with bouquets of flowers resting on its\\npedestal. fred would smirk at the flowers. he never said he was a\\nsaint, not the way he was doling out appearance money to attract\\ntop runners, but he was a visionary.\\n\\nthe marathon seems to have passed into other capable hands. it\\nwon\\'t be long before they put the bleachers back in the park.\\n\\njohn w. ripley, a highly decorated former colonel who entered\\nmarine corps lore when he single-handedly blunted a major north\\nvietnamese offensive during the vietnam war by blowing up a\\nstrategically placed bridge, died oct. 28 at his home in annapolis,\\nmd. he was 69.\\n\\nthe cause has not been determined, his son stephen said.\\n\\nripley, who at the time was a captain and a military adviser to\\na south vietnamese marine unit, blew up the southern end of the\\ndong ha bridge over the cua viet river on easter sunday, april 2,\\n1972. on the north side of the bridge, which was several miles\\nsouth of the demilitarized zone, some 20,000 north vietnamese\\ntroops and 200 tanks were poised to sweep into quang tri province,\\nwhich was sparsely defended.\\n\\ngoing back and forth for three hours while under fire, ripley\\nswung hand over hand along the steel i-beams beneath the bridge,\\nsecuring himself between girders and placing crates holding a total\\nof 500 pounds of tnt in a diagonal line from one side of the\\nstructure to the other. the i-beam wings were just wide enough to\\nform pathways along which he could slide the boxes.\\n\\nwhen the boxes were in place on the bridge, ripley attached\\nblasting caps to detonate the tnt, then connected them with a\\ntimed-fuse cord that eventually extended hundreds of feet.\\n\\n\"he had to bite down on the blasting caps to attach them to the\\nfuses,\" john grider miller, author of \"the bridge at dong ha,\"\\nsaid on monday. \"if he bit too low on the blasting cap, it could\\ncome loose; if he bit too high, it could blow his head apart.\"\\n\\nripley bit safely, and the timed-fuse cord gave him about half\\nan hour to clamber off the bridge. moments later, his work paid off\\nwith a shock wave that tossed him into the air but otherwise left\\nhim unharmed.\\n\\nby placing the crates diagonally along the bridge, miller said,\\nripley had created \"a twisting motion that ripped the bridge apart\\nfrom its moorings so it couldn\\'t fall back in place, but collapsed\\ninto the river.\"\\n\\nthere were about 600 south vietnamese marines near the south end\\nof the bridge. \"south vietnam would have been in big trouble,\"\\nsaid fred schultz, senior editor of naval history magazine, a\\npublication of the united states naval institute. \"the force\\nnumbers defending on that side could not have held against that\\nnorth vietnamese force.\"\\n\\nthe destruction of the bridge created a bottleneck for the north\\nvietnamese, allowing u.s. bombers to blunt what became known as the\\neaster offensive.\\n\\nripley was awarded the navy cross for his actions at the bridge.\\nhe served two tours in vietnam and remained on active duty until\\n1992, eventually rising to colonel. among other decorations, he\\nreceived the silver star, two bronze stars and a purple heart.\\n\\njohn walter ripley was born on june 29, 1939, and grew up in\\nradford, va., the son of bud and verna holt ripley. he enlisted in\\nthe marines out of high school in 1956, and a year later received\\napproval from the secretary of the navy to attend a preparatory\\nschool leading to his appointment to the naval academy, from which\\nhe graduated in 1962.\\n\\nbesides his son stephen, ripley is survived by his wife of 44\\nyears, the former moline blaylock; a sister, susan goodykoontz; two\\nother sons, thomas and john; a daughter, mary ripley; and eight\\ngrandchildren.\\n\\n\"colonel ripley is well known in marine circles,\" schultz\\nsaid, \"but he\\'s the most revered war hero no one\\'s ever heard\\nof.\"\\n\\n\"this was 1972,\" he added, \"and people didn\\'t pay too much\\nattention to war heroes at that time.\"\\n\\nwelcome back, rex grossman. all of chicago shivers at the\\nthought, but the bears will probably be without quarterback kyle\\norton for at least a month with a high ankle sprain.\\n\\nit is hard to think of orton in the same desperate way that\\ndallas fans think of tony romo, but orton has evolved, for lack of\\na better alternative, into the bears\\' franchise quarterback. and he\\nhad been especially hot in recent weeks.\\n\\ngrossman rallied the bears from a 10-point deficit to beat the\\nlions on sunday. his weakness, however, is legendary: bad\\ninterceptions.\\n\\nin the 2006 season, when he started every game and the bears\\nwent to the super bowl on the back of their defense, grossman threw\\n20 interceptions against 23 touchdown passes. for old-time\\'s sake,\\nhe threw one sunday, too. enter this weekend\\'s opponent, the\\ntennessee titans, who are 8-0 thanks to a spectacular defense that\\nhas 22 sacks and is tied for the league lead with 13 interceptions.\\ngood luck with that, rex.\\n\\nafter the titans, it\\'s a three-week journey that includes stops\\nin green bay and minnesota. the bears are in first place in the\\nmediocre nfc north. grossman will have to be much better than the\\ncowboys\\' backups -- and better than earlier versions of himself -- to\\nkeep the bears from slipping fast.\\n\\nit helps that he now has the rookie running back matt forte\\nbehind him. forte is the league\\'s seventh-leading rusher, with 641\\nyards. he had 101 yards in the second half sunday, when the bears\\nneeded him most.\\n\\nmaybe the bears can copy the formula the titans have used with\\nkerry collins, who has demonstrated the value of a competent backup\\n(pay attention, cowboys): pound opponents with defense and a\\nrunning game, and make the quarterback win games only when\\nnecessary.\\n\\ncleveland quarterback quandary\\n\\nwe may soon get a look at the ultimate backup quarterback\\nquandary -- or is it a starting quarterback quandary? the browns\\nwere 37-27 losers on sunday to the ravens and their rookie\\nquarterback joe flacco. cleveland coach romeo crennel said monday\\nthat a change was coming.\\n\\n\"we didn\\'t do enough in the passing game,\" crennel said.\\n\\nthat has been a theme this year for quarterback derek anderson,\\nwhose completion rate is below 50 percent and who was foiled by a\\nconfounding braylon edwards drop -- confounding because edwards\\ndidn\\'t talk to the news media to explain what happened -- and a\\nterrell suggs interception that was returned for a touchdown. last\\nyear, anderson was the nfl\\'s cinderella story at quarterback as the\\nbrowns made a playoff push. but he faded late in the season.\\n\\ncleveland\\'s defense is largely to blame for sunday\\'s collapse --\\n37 points to the ravens?\\n\\non monday, crennel said anderson was his quarterback \"as of\\nright now.\" by monday night, anderson wasn\\'t his quarterback,\\nafter all. the former first-round pick brady quinn will start\\nthursday against the broncos.\\n\\nbut it\\'s clear this is not the browns\\' year. the steelers and\\nthe ravens are ahead of them and figure to battle for the afc north\\nthe rest of the way, and it will soon be time to see if they have\\nthe right quarterback in waiting.\\n\\ndysfunction junction\\n\\na scene in the cowboys\\' locker room just about summed up one of\\ntheir biggest problems. after dallas\\' 35-14 loss to the giants on\\nsunday, reporters approached receiver terrell owens, who had\\nfumbled.\\n\\n\"there\\'s no question i\\'m a capable receiver,\" he said,\\naccording to the fort worth star-telegram. what he did not have to\\nsay was that he did not think the current cowboys quarterbacks were\\nquite as capable, and certainly not capable enough to get the wide\\nreceivers the ball. brad johnson and brooks bollinger have been\\ndreadful; the cowboys have had only three passes of more than 20\\nyards in the past two games.\\n\\nthe team\\'s owner, jerry jones, spent most of his postgame\\nsession with reporters trying to explain why the cowboys, who spent\\nmore than $80 million in bonuses this year, thought they could\\nexist with no safety net behind romo. but it was not romo or\\njohnson or bollinger who was stripped of the ball. and it certainly\\nwas not one of them waving giants running back brandon jacobs\\nthrough the defense.\\n\\nbut really, while owens thought he was talking about his talent,\\nhe was actually revealing something about the cowboys\\' foundation.\\nisn\\'t one of the syrupy cliches of sports that teams win together\\nand lose together? nobody should have expected that from a cowboys\\nteam that was assembled, appropriately considering they are new\\nbusiness partners, from the outdated playbook of the early 1990s\\nyankees: overpay for big names and watch the team descend into a\\nquagmire of personal interest.\\n\\nearlier this season, owens complained about not being thrown to\\nenough, and that was after the cowboys\\' first loss. romo, by the\\nway, was the quarterback.\\n\\ncoach wade phillips seems likely to survive the bye week, a\\ntraditionally dangerous time for coaches of troubled teams, because\\nthe cowboys have few options. what would they do, turn the team\\nover to jason garrett, who was the offense\\'s boy wonder back in the\\ngood old days of september? instead, phillips will probably be gone\\nafter this season if the cowboys do not reach the playoffs and make\\na run.\\n\\ndallas is a spectacularly talented team with possibly the best\\nroster in the game. but no team has ever needed its bye week more.\\nthey will probably get romo, running back felix jones and maybe\\ncornerback terence newman back in two weeks. that will certainly\\nhelp, but the cowboys lost two games with romo. the cowboys need to\\nwin five of their last seven just to get to 10 victories, and even\\njerry jones, an eternal optimist who assembled this dysfunctional\\ngroup, admitted he would gladly take a playoff spot right now. he\\nknows how fragile his team is.\\n\\nbut maybe team chemistry is finally taking hold. after all, the\\nlatest big name to join the roster, receiver roy williams, told\\nreporters he was \"fine\" after the game, the same word owens used.\\n\"it\\'s frustrating for me, because i\\'m on the sidelines,\" williams\\nsaid. \"you can\\'t do nothing on the sidelines.\" he added: \"i\\'m on\\nthe sideline waiting. i feel like i\\'m in high school.\"\\n\\nsounds as if he\\'s fitting right in.\\n\\nmaybe it is best for debby ledford to get this out of her twin\\nsons\\' way so early in their careers, so early in the season.\\n\\nthere will be tugging emotions for ledford -- and a conflicting\\nwardrobe -- when the new jersey nets host the phoenix suns on\\ntuesday night. in the first meeting of what could biannually cycle\\nitself for the next decade or so, ledford\\'s sons, the 7-foot\\ncenters brook and robin lopez, will be on opposing nba teams.\\n\\ndoes she clap her hands if one scores over the other? or does\\nshe simply sit on them, waiting for a less biased time to cheer?\\n\\neven she is not quite sure.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t know,\" said ledford, who will be wearing a nets shirt\\nand a suns hat to the izod center. \"i haven\\'t had to deal with\\nthat yet. this is going to be a first for me, too. i\\'ll just enjoy\\nit and cheer for everybody.\"\\n\\na genetic rivalry now makes its professional debut. brook and\\nrobin first teamed together as first graders playing on a\\nsecond-grade team, then at san joaquin memorial high school in\\nfresno, calif., and later at stanford university.\\n\\nwhen an opponent beat one to the basket, the other loomed at his\\nside. together, brook and robin learned both their strengths and\\nweakness from each other.\\n\\n\"they started that rivalry in the driveway,\" ledford said.\\n\"but a driveway rivalry is one thing. opposite teams in the nba is\\nanother.\"\\n\\nthey prepared for the separation the way they had for everything\\nin their lives: scrimmaging against each other, before the draft in\\ntheir native fresno.\\n\\nearly one-on-one duels produced a sibling rivalry, which in turn\\nproduced sibling bickering from the 20-year-olds.\\n\\n\"whoever lost ended up breaking a broom or something like\\nthat,\" brook said. \"a lot of stuff got kicked, thrown around,\\ndepending on who would win.\"\\n\\nledford said: \"the beautiful thing is they\\'ve gotten along\\nprobably 98 percent of the time. the other 2 percent is when\\nthey\\'re in the driveway and one blocks the other\\'s shot.\"\\n\\nbrook and robin declared early for the draft, forgoing two\\nseasons of collegiate eligibility. they were each taken in the\\nfirst round, and their straight-lined paths finally diverged.\\n\\n\"we really only text each other when we actually need\\nsomething; it\\'s never to see how things are going,\" brook said\\nwith a chuckle.\\n\\nit is a little bit more than that. the twins\\' affinity for the\\nfine arts and disney has been well documented, and when they do\\ncatch up, it is rarely about basketball.\\n\\nthey plan to collaborate on books, with brook writing and robin\\nillustrating. so, whenever one spots inspiration, he either texts\\nor posts a facebook message to his brother, like a quote from \"the\\nsimpsons\" robin recently typed onto brook\\'s facebook page.\\n\\nthey will become the fifth set of twins to play in the nba, a\\nrare occurrence throughout the league, but not necessarily in east\\nrutherford, n.j. jason collins, who spent parts of seven seasons\\nwith the nets before his trade to the memphis grizzlies last\\nseason, regularly dueled his twin brother, jarron, of the utah\\njazz. they also attended stanford.\\n\\nbrook said he was caught up in a whirlwind of adjustment and had\\nnot given much thought to tuesday\\'s matchup. but as the season\\nprogresses, he will probably pine for his brother more and more,\\nhis teammate jarvis hayes said.\\n\\nhayes played alongside his brother, jonas, at western carolina\\nuniversity and the university of georgia before jarvis headed to\\nthe nba and jonas to coaching. he is an assistant at belmont abbey\\ncollege in north carolina.\\n\\n\"twenty-one or 22 years to that point, we had been inseparable,\\nso my rookie year was probably the toughest to cope with because i\\nwas away from him for the first time,\" jarvis said. \"i ask brook\\nevery now and then if he\\'s talked to robin, but it\\'s kind of the\\nbeginning now. right now, it\\'s the fast course, trying to learn\\neverything. as the season goes along, it\\'ll get to a point where\\nthey\\'ll want to talk to each other more.\"\\n\\nledford dispatched an older brother with each twin to help them\\nadjust to the professional life. alexander, who played at santa\\nclara university and the university of washington, is with robin in\\nphoenix. christopher accompanied brook to new jersey.\\n\\nthere is little time to enjoy anything but basketball. a city\\ndripping in culture and arts is only a river away for brook,\\ntantamount to holding candy to the face of a child. but he has yet\\nto explore new york city in depth. a planned trip to see \"the\\nlittle mermaid\" on broadway was postponed after vince carter\\ncalled for a team bowling outing.\\n\\nbrook was a mildly disappointed, but he is on a youthful nets\\nteam, garnering meaningful minutes in the first few games. robin\\nstarts his career as shaquille o\\'neal\\'s backup, the heir apparent\\nto the man known as the big aristotle as he slowly makes his exit.\\n\\nthat can mean erratic or no court time, but a lot of lessons\\nprovided by o\\'neal.\\n\\n\"that\\'s only going to make you better,\" robin said of the\\ndaily bumps and bruises provided by o\\'neal. \"it\\'s an invaluable\\nexperience.\"\\n\\neven if robin does not get off the bench tuesday night, it will\\nbe a little surreal. for so long, through so many games, the\\ntight-knit brothers stood side by side. in many ways, they still\\ndo.\\n\\n\"it\\'s going to be weird,\" brook said. \"i hope one of us\\ndoesn\\'t embarrass the other too bad. we\\'ll see what happens.\"\\n\\nterence d. tolbert, the state director in nevada for sen. barack\\nobama\\'s presidential campaign and an aide to new york city schools\\nchancellor joel i. klein, died on sunday in north las vegas. he was\\n44.\\n\\nthe cause was a heart attack, mayor michael r. bloomberg said in\\na statement. a friend, basil a. smikle jr., said tolbert was\\nstricken while driving alone on sunday night near the obama\\ncampaign offices in north las vegas.\\n\\nsince 2006, tolbert had been the new york city education\\ndepartment\\'s chief lobbyist in albany and washington. he had been\\npoised to take a leading role in bloomberg\\'s coming fight to\\npersuade new york lawmakers to reauthorize the law giving the mayor\\ncontrol of the city\\'s public schools. the law expires at the end of\\njune.\\n\\ntolbert had been on leave since august working for the obama\\ncampaign. in 2003-4, he was the new york state director for john\\nedwards\\' presidential campaign, and in 2004, he was the nevada\\nstate director of america coming together, a democratic advocacy\\ngroup.\\n\\ntolbert also worked on bloomberg\\'s re-election effort in 2005,\\nserving as a liaison to the city\\'s patchwork of ethnic, religious\\nand cultural groups, and for eight years was chief of staff to\\nassemblyman keith l.t. wright, a harlem democrat.\\n\\ntolbert, a graduate of hunter college, was born and raised in\\nharlem, where he lived with his wife, freida foster-tolbert. in\\naddition to his wife, he is survived by his mother, carolyn.\\n\\nthe hugs came first, then the humility.\\ntayshaun prince leaned down with one arm and pulled larry brown\\nclose. rasheed wallace followed, with a joyous shriek -- \"l-beezie!\\nwhat\\'s up, man?\" -- and a full, two-arm embrace. richard hamilton\\nwas next. smile, squeeze, repeat.\\n\\nbrown looked like a bride in a receiving line monday morning\\nwhen the detroit pistons (his former team) walked onto the\\nbasketball court, moments after the charlotte bobcats (his current\\nteam) had exited. brown soaked up the affection, then added a dash\\nof wry perspective: \"it\\'s probably that they\\'re happy to have me\\nleave.\"\\n\\nhe was smiling, but not necessarily joking. with brown, the\\nfeelings are always a mixed bag, sprinkled with neuroses and\\nconflicting impulses. he is personally loyal and professionally\\nperipatetic, a brilliant teacher who exhausts his charges, a highly\\nrespected coach who almost appeared unemployable.\\n\\nnow brown is back where his dizzying odyssey began, nearly four\\ndecades and 11 jobs ago. he seems content, energized and happy to,\\nin brown parlance, \"smell the gym\" again, after two years in the\\nnba wilderness. but the turbulent past is never far from his gaze.\\n\\nbrown crossed paths with the pistons on monday, a team he split\\nwith acrimoniously in 2005, just 13 months after taking them to the\\nchampionship. he returns to madison square garden on wednesday for\\na much more fraught reunion with the knicks. the boos and taunts\\nwill surely outnumber the hugs.\\n\\nit has been two and a half years since brown feuded with stephon\\nmarbury, lost a power struggle with isiah thomas and was fired, for\\ncause, by james l. dolan, the garden chairman, after a 23-59\\nseason.\\n\\nthe ending was farcical and sad, with brown attending dozens of\\ndraft workouts even after his imminent firing had been widely\\nreported. he spent a month in awkward limbo. prohibited from\\nspeaking to the news media at the knicks\\' training center, brown\\nheld impromptu roadside interviews with reporters and morosely\\ndeclared himself a \"dead man walking.\"\\n\\nthe scars have not entirely healed, for brown or the franchise.\\nthomas was fired as coach and president last spring. marbury, who\\nclashed with brown and thomas, has been demoted to the inactive\\nlist by the new coach, mike d\\'antoni. the optimism of a new era has\\nbeen doused by reminders of the past -- by thomas\\' reported overdose\\non sleeping pills and marbury\\'s exile.\\n\\nnow brown is walking back into the breach, although with no\\nsense of vindication.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t get any satisfaction out of seeing anybody\\nstruggling,\" brown said softly after the bobcats\\' morning\\nshootaround.\\n\\n\"look, i mean, i\\'m gone. and when mr. dolan made that decision,\\ni\\'m moving on with my life. i don\\'t blame anybody, and i hope that\\nnever came out that i blamed anybody about what happened. i was the\\ncoach. but my challenge is to do better with charlotte.\"\\n\\nthe knicks did more than fire brown in june 2006. dolan publicly\\nlashed brown for every perceived misstep and every violation of\\ncompany policy. dolan said that brown pushed to acquire jalen rose\\nand steve francis, then turned on them. he accused brown of trying\\nto orchestrate trades behind thomas\\' back. the list of offenses was\\nso long that dolan had to read from prepared notes.\\n\\nthe knicks withheld the $41 million left on brown\\'s contract,\\nbut eventually paid him $18.5 million in a settlement brokered by\\ncommissioner david stern.\\n\\nin interviews over the last two years, brown has repeatedly said\\nthat he \"did a bad job\" with the knicks. but he has never\\nanswered dolan\\'s charges publicly, and he said he did not intend\\nto.\\n\\n\"it doesn\\'t do any good,\" he said. \"again, i was given an\\nunbelievable opportunity; it didn\\'t work out. i know why it didn\\'t\\nwork out. but it\\'s going to always be a personal thing.\"\\n\\nhe added, \"any time anybody tells you you\\'re a failure, it\\nhurts.\"\\n\\nany animus toward the garden is offset by brown\\'s deep affection\\nfor donnie walsh, the new knicks president. walsh began his nba\\ncareer on brown\\'s coaching staff in denver, and he later hired\\nbrown to coach the indiana pacers. oddly enough, brown encouraged\\nwalsh, a fellow new yorker, to take the knicks job.\\n\\n\"i said if you only have to answer to mr. dolan and you have a\\nrelationship with him, i can\\'t think of a job better in the\\nleague,\" brown said. \"the guy will do anything he can to give you\\nthe resources to win.\"\\n\\nbrown offered his earnest hope that walsh and d\\'antoni can\\nsucceed where he failed.\\n\\n\"you remember when i said at my press conference how important\\nit was for the league to have a good team in new york? i wanted to\\nhelp that,\" brown said. \"if you ever do a good job as a coach in\\nnew york, you help our sport.\"\\n\\nfailing in new york brings its own unique consequences. brown\\nspent two years without a whistle, the longest such break in a\\n36-year hall of fame career. he was thrown a lifeline by his\\nfriends with the 76ers, who gave him a consulting job and time to\\nponder his options.\\n\\n\"i\\'d have gone crazy if i didn\\'t have any involvement,\" said\\nbrown, a notorious gym rat.\\n\\nhe spent a lot of time at villanova games and toured the country\\nmeeting with coaches he likes and admires -- ben howland at ucla,\\nbill self at kansas, roy williams at north carolina, his alma\\nmater.\\n\\n\"i spent two years learning,\" brown said. \"i never got to\\nwatch other people coach. it was wonderful.\"\\n\\nbrown said he was a better man and a better coach for having\\nsurvived the knicks experience. he will have to be to have any\\nchance of winning in charlotte.\\n\\nthe bobcats have never won more than 33 games in their four-year\\nexistence. they are among the youngest teams in the league. two of\\ntheir most recent lottery picks, adam morrison and sean may, have\\nbeen derailed by injuries. their bench is thin, but the bobcats\\nhave high hopes for point guard d.j. augustin, whom they drafted\\nwith the ninth pick in june.\\n\\n\"oh, it\\'s a huge challenge,\" brown said. \"i don\\'t think it\\nwill happen overnight.\"\\n\\nas homecomings go, this one seems to hold more promise, or at\\nleast less drama. in new york, brown was promoted as a franchise\\nsavior, although the odds were always against him succeeding. in\\ncharlotte, the expectations and pressure are lower, the environment\\nfriendlier and less frantic.\\n\\nbrown\\'s mother, who will turn 104 soon, lives nearby. so do his\\ntwo daughters and five grandchildren. his brother herb is back on\\nhis staff, along with dave hanners and phil ford, who were also on\\nthe

no clear outlook and both major parties\\ndispatching high-profile names to the campaign trail in a\\nlast-minute rally for votes.\\n\\nroughly half a dozen seats remained closely contested, leaving\\nthe final makeup of the senate -- where republicans hold 31 seats\\nand democrats hold 29 (there are two vacancies) -- extremely\\ndifficult to predict.\\n\\ndemocrats have enlisted former president bill clinton, sens.\\nhillary rodham clinton and charles e. schumer, and attorney general\\nandrew m. cuomo to make appearances and to record automated phone\\ncalls in a slew of races in western new york and queens, and on\\nlong island.\\n\\ngov. david a. paterson has defied earlier speculation that he\\nwould play a fairly limited role in the senate elections, moving\\naggressively to help his democratic colleagues toward victories\\nthat would give the party unified control of state government for\\nthe first time since 1935.\\n\\nafter weeks of intense fund-raising, paterson has garnered more\\nthan $3 million for democratic campaigns, after setting a target of\\n$2 million in september. he has made a last-minute rush of\\nappearances, too, angering senate republicans, who had expected him\\nto be less visible on the campaign trail.\\n\\npaterson appeared in buffalo on saturday with sen. william t.\\nstachowski and joe mesi, a former boxer who is campaigning for an\\nopen seat in the city\\'s suburbs. on sunday, paterson stumped on\\nlong island with brian x. foley and kristen mcelroy. foley is\\nchallenging sen. caesar trunzo, a suffolk county republican, while\\nmcelroy is trying to unseat sen. kemp hannon, a nassau county\\nrepublican.\\n\\nmcelroy\\'s bid is widely considered a long shot, but democrats\\nare hoping that a strong showing by sen. barack obama in the\\npresidential contest will contribute to a last-minute defeat of\\nhannon, whose district has a large population of black voters and\\ndemocrats.\\n\\nrepublicans have enlisted michael r. bloomberg, the new york\\ncity mayor and a top ally. bloomberg campaigned for sen. serphin r.\\nmaltese of queens on friday and has recorded automated calls for\\nseveral republican candidates, including liz feld, who is\\nchallenging sen. suzi oppenheimer in westchester.\\n\\nwhile officials of both parties expressed confidence that they\\nwould wake up on wednesday with a majority, neither side would\\noffer a public prediction of how many seats it expected to win or\\nlose, reflecting the uncertainty of the campaigns.\\n\\nboth clintons have recorded phone calls for joseph p. addabbo\\njr., the new york city councilman who is challenging maltese in\\nwhat is perhaps the most hotly contested race of the campaign.\\n\\nthe fight for the senate has been made all the more unclear by\\nthe shifting allegiances of two incumbent democrats and two\\ndemocrats expected to win seats on tuesday, who announced last week\\nthat they would form an independent caucus that might side with\\neither party in a leadership battle between dean g. skelos, the\\nrepublican senate majority leader, and malcolm a. smith, the\\nminority leader.\\n\\none of the four planning the new caucus, sen. ruben diaz sr., a\\nbronx democrat, said on monday that he would not vote for any\\nleader who would allow a vote on legislation to legalize same-sex\\nmarriage in new york, something smith supports.\\n\\n\"i would not vote for anyone that would push for gay\\nmarriage,\" diaz said.\\n\\nbut smith appears to have headed off -- for now -- a leadership\\nchallenge from his deputy, jeffrey d. klein of the bronx, an avid\\nfundraiser who has made little secret of his ambitions. klein said\\nthat when democrats gather for a scheduled meeting in albany on\\nwednesday, he will be offering smith his full support.\\n\\n\"i intend to support malcolm smith as majority leader, and\\nhopefully i\\'ll be the deputy,\" klein said. \"i hope he\\'ll give me\\nthe opportunity to nominate him as the next majority leader.\"\\n\\ngregory peck film collection\\n\\nthese days we seem to prefer an informal, buddy-buddy\\nrelationship with our movie stars. but there was a time when a more\\ndecorous, paternal authority was in fashion, the sort of authority\\nthat gregory peck projected over the course of his long career.\\n\\npeck\\'s gift for combining emotional distance and moral\\ncompassion is best represented by his most famous role, the\\ntranscendently decent small-town lawyer atticus finch in \"to kill\\na mockingbird,\" robert mulligan\\'s 1962 adaptation of harper lee\\'s\\nnovel. peck\\'s oscar-winning performance is naturally the\\ncenterpiece of \"the gregory peck film collection,\" a handsomely\\nproduced boxed set from universal studios home entertainment.\\n\\nthe set also contains peck\\'s more vigorously protective\\npaterfamilias in j. lee thompson\\'s 1962 \"cape fear,\" as well as\\nfour films new to dvd: raoul walsh\\'s \"world in his arms\" (1952),\\ndavid miller\\'s \"captain newman, m.d.\" (1963), edward dmytryk\\'s\\n\"mirage\" (1965) and stanley donen\\'s \"arabesque\" (1966).\\n\\nlike john wayne, his ideological opposite, peck became a star\\nduring world war ii, thanks partly to the shortage of leading men,\\nmany of the more established actors having been called into\\nservice. as a father of four, wayne had a family exemption; peck\\nwas passed over because of a bad back, injured during studio\\ndancing lessons led by martha graham.\\n\\nand yet, and in very different ways, wayne and peck came to\\nembody the figure of the american fighting man, wayne as an active\\ncombatant and peck -- in a series of films that included \"twelve\\no\\'clock high\" (1949) and \"the man in the gray flannel suit\"\\n(1956) -- as the sadly matured returning vet. even in films that\\nweren\\'t related to war, the crisis of peck\\'s character was often\\nthat of the former man of action now hemmed in by family\\nresponsibilities and social restraints.\\n\\nby the 1960s, when peck was working consistently at universal,\\nhe had acquired a sort of elder-statesman status. he often played a\\nmiddle-aged hero whose greatest accomplishments might be behind\\nhim, but who is still capable of rising to the occasion. the most\\nfamous example is the southern district attorney in \"cape fear\"\\nwho goes to extreme measures to protect his family from a roving\\npsychopath (robert mitchum) he once sent to prison.\\n\\n\"captain newman, m.d.\" is a more or less explicit attempt to\\nextend the franchise of \"to kill a mockingbird,\" with peck as an\\narmy psychiatrist in world war ii, tending with warmth and humor to\\nthe broken minds of soldiers sent back from the front. it is an\\nideal role for him, but the film is flatly directed and episodic.\\nthe supporting characters are presented as simple psychological\\nriddles -- a guilt-ridden flier (bobby darin), a schizophrenic\\ncolonel (eddie albert) and so on -- that captain newman solves with\\na single, penetrating insight.\\n\\nfar more interesting is \"mirage,\" a cleverly plotted\\nblack-and-white thriller written by peter stone, whose screenplay\\nfor \"charade\" had just proved a big hit for cary grant, audrey\\nhepburn and the director stanley donen. the more somber \"mirage\"\\nblends peck\\'s gray flannel persona with elements of his amnesia\\nvictim in alfred hitchcock\\'s \"spellbound\" (1945).\\n\\nhere he is a corporate functionary who finds, after an\\nelectrical blackout in his manhattan office tower, that he has no\\nreal idea of who he is or how he has spent the last two years. as\\nin \"charade,\" none of the characters are quite who they seem to\\nbe, and the solution to the mystery, revealed in small increments,\\ncalls on cold war paranoia in ways that evoke \"the manchurian\\ncandidate.\"\\n\\nstone, under the pseudonym pierre marton, also contributed to\\nthe screenplay of \"arabesque,\" a sardonic thriller directed in\\nhigh style by donen as a direct follow-up to \"charade.\" but this\\ntime peck is miscast in a role -- an academic specialist in\\nhieroglyphics drawn into middle eastern intrigue -- that seems\\ntailor-made for grant\\'s playfulness and self-mockery, two qualities\\nnot among peck\\'s professional attributes.\\n\\nin the most memorable sequence a fully clothed peck finds\\nhimself in a shower stall with the villain\\'s treacherous mistress\\n(sophia loren) and must keep his eyes and mind off loren\\'s\\nspectacular nudity or risk revealing his presence. where erotic\\nagony is required, peck can summon only a sense of embarrassment.\\n\\nthe revelation of the universal set is an eye-popping\\ntechnicolor restoration of \"the world in his arms,\" one of two\\nfilms (the other is warner brothers\\' \"captain horatio\\nhornblower\") in which peck collaborated with the great action\\ndirector raoul walsh.\\n\\nwalsh, who someday will be granted the place he deserves\\nalongside john ford and howard hawks, often told stories of\\nadventurer heroes with wild ambitions and unfettered appetites,\\nfigures who found their most satisfying incarnation in errol flynn.\\n\\nat first peck hardly seems to fit the mold -- for one thing, he\\ncan\\'t throw a convincing stage punch, a basic requirement for the\\nwalshian hero -- but he seems to expand in stature as \"the world in\\nhis arms\" progresses. walsh brings out the natural athlete in the\\n6-foot-3 peck, who had been on the rowing team at the university of\\ncalifornia, berkeley, good preparation, perhaps, for this seagoing\\nswashbuckler about a seal-hunting captain in 1850 who romances a\\nrussian princess (ann blyth) while dreaming of a way to buy alaska\\nfrom the czar.\\n\\n\"we go!\" is the rallying cry of peck\\'s big-boned aleutian\\nsidekick (bill radovich), and it might as well be walsh\\'s motto as\\nwell: \"the world in his arms,\" like most of his films, overflows\\nwith movement and vitality. with his use of background action and\\noff-screen space, walsh constantly suggests that the drama in the\\nforeground is only a fraction of a much wider world in continuous\\ntumult, a world that extends beyond the boundaries of the story, of\\nwhich it may not even be aware. for a moment gregory peck was part\\nof this world; inevitably, his sober, responsible temperament drew\\nhim elsewhere.\\n\\n(the gregory peck film collection, universal studios home\\nentertainment, $59.98, unrated)\\n\\nother new releases\\n\\n\\'get smart\\'\\n\\nsteve

the\\npoor.\\n\\nthe french movie hardly bothers with politics, dwelling on\\ncoluche\\'s love life instead. cultural gulfs can sometimes reveal\\nthemselves in these small details. france, it turns out, remains,\\neven all these years later, not insignificantly caught up in the\\ncinema spawned by the occupation, offering diversion, self-flattery\\nand escapist fiction about itself.\\n\\nserious-minded americans traditionally love to idealize the\\nfrench movie industry, but as french cinephiles tend to see it,\\nit\\'s their own filmmakers, unlike those in the united states, who\\nshy away from tackling head-on tough issues like contemporary\\nfrench politics, scandals and unrest. contrarians will note \"la\\nhaine\" (\"the hate\"), a much-talked-about movie anticipating the\\nviolence that exploded three years ago in some of france\\'s poor\\nimmigrant suburbs. but \"la haine\" was released in the mid-1990s.\\n\\nmeanwhile, never mind poor box office results, the united states\\nkeeps churning out ambitious pictures with big stars or directors,\\nlike \"in the valley of elah,\" \"lions for lambs,\" \"rendition,\"\\n\"redacted\" and \"body of lies,\" questioning american policy in\\nthe middle east or otherwise seizing on the headlines. france\\nhasn\\'t made a significant movie yet about the 2005 riots.\\n\\nthe country has censored politically charged films, including\\njean-luc godard\\'s \"petit soldat\" (made in 1960 but not released\\nuntil 1963), a rare french picture about the algerian war of\\nindependence. \"the battle of algiers,\" the greatest film about\\nthat war, was an italian-algerian production, not a french one,\\ndirected by an italian. it was banned for many years after its\\nrelease in 1966.\\n\\nthe closest thing to a french \"apocalypse now\" or \"platoon\"\\nabout algeria is \"l\\'ennemi intime,\" made last year, close to half\\na century after the war ended. as for a french version of \"w.,\"\\nany film skewering a sitting french president \"would be nearly\\nimpossible to make here,\" said caroline benjo, echoing what other\\nfrench filmmakers contend.\\n\\nthey cite a mix of politics, stylistic habits perpetuating the\\nnational \"brand,\" financing and a collective anxiety about\\npostwar french identity. the problem, you might say, goes back to\\nde gaulle\\'s selling the country on the idea that it won world war\\nii, along with the culture of denial that that mindset promoted.\\n\\nbenjo is a producer of \"entre les murs\" (\"within the walls,\"\\nmarketed in english as \"the class\"), which won the palme d\\'or at\\ncannes this year. a drama about schoolchildren from a multiethnic\\nneighborhood of paris, it has so far done well at the french box\\noffice. like the promiscuously awarded \"la graine et le mulet\"\\n(opening next month in the united states as \"the secret of the\\ngrain\"), directed by abdellatif kechiche, which is about a\\ncommunity of immigrants in a seaside town in the south of france,\\n\"entre les murs\" is \"l\\'exception culturelle.\"\\n\\nthat phrase ordinarily connotes not \"exception to the rule\"\\nbut the exceptional status of culture here. money for french films\\ncomes partly from a percentage of ticket sales for american\\nblockbusters, and from french television networks, which by law\\nmust underwrite films.\\n\\nthis means that french movies now at the multiplex, like\\n\"faubourg 36,\" a nostalgic music hall story about bygone france,\\nor \"le crime est notre affaire,\" a nostalgic mystery based on an\\nagatha christie story, are effectively supported by french revenues\\nfrom american films like \"blood diamond,\" \"charlie wilson\\'s\\nwar,\" \"syriana\" and other news-hungry, hollywood vehicles of\\nprecisely the sort that france doesn\\'t make.\\n\\npublic television is government-run, of course, and the\\ncountry\\'s most popular network, tf1, happens to be owned by martin\\nbouygues, a close associate of the president, nicolas sarkozy.\\n\"naturally television executives try to influence content,\"\\njean-michel frodon, the editor of cahiers du cinema, noted the\\nother day.\\n\\nthat said, france likes to boast, for good reason, that with\\nmore than 220 films made here a year, the country\\'s movie industry\\nlags behind only those of india and the united states. among these\\n220 movies, a modest number of high-quality documentaries or\\nfictional dramas detailing poverty or immigrant life here are\\nreleased, but they\\'re generally \"small films made in the\\nshadows,\" frodon said.\\n\\nas antoine de baecque, a film historian, put it, \"french cinema\\nsince nouvelle vague deals with reality in a certain way.\" he was\\ntalking the other afternoon about the french new wave of the late\\n1950s and \\'60s, led by francois truffaut and godard. \"we like to\\nfracture, distort and romanticize -- to see trauma but obliquely,\\nabstractly. in this sense french cinema is the opposite of american\\ncinema. it values style over realism, the small form over the\\nepic.\"\\n\\nde baecque chalked this approach up to a french \"inferiority\\ncomplex, a feeling that since world war ii, france, despite what we\\nlike to tell ourselves, is downgraded from the front rank of\\nhistory, which creates melancholy, a malaise,\" he said. \"the\\nromantic comedies, the sentimental affairs, they are fictions that\\nremove us from real life and are precisely the kind of movies that\\nemerged out of the occupation.\"\\n\\nthe most popular film ever made in france was released this\\nyear, \"bienvenue chez les ch\\'tis\" (\"welcome to the land of the\\nsh\\'tis\"), a harmless comedy about a postal employee from the south\\nforced to work in the north. largely unnoted by the french,\\nadmirably or out of avoidance, was that the two main stars of the\\nmovie, imitating regional clich?s, both happened to be frenchmen of\\nnorth african descent.\\n\\non the other hand, newspapers were full of stories the other\\nweek about the burning of cars belonging to luc besson\\'s film crew.\\nin montfermeil, a poor town outside paris, besson has been shooting\\na big-budget american-style thriller with john travolta. but it\\'s\\nnot about the riots in that neighborhood in 2005.\\n\\nfor that, french people these days must turn to programs like\\n\"la commune,\" a dark television drama that ran this year on canal\\nplus. its inspiration was not french cinema but american cable\\nseries like \"the wire\" on hbo. \"la commune,\" glowingly received\\nby french critics, was canceled when the network decided its\\naudience wasn\\'t large enough; never mind that other shows on canal\\nplus with similar audiences were renewed.\\n\\nabdel raouf dafri, the show\\'s writer, an excitable 44-year-old\\neven without the heavily sugared espressos he gulped one recent\\nmorning, shook his head in disgust. \"the real-life characters in\\nthe series were blacks and arabs, traditional conservative muslims,\\nleaders after the white policeman in the neighborhood had given\\nup,\" he said, \"and france doesn\\'t like to look in the mirror\\nexcept to see itself as the most beautiful nation. some people\\nthought the series was too violent, but i said look at american\\nseries. the french response to that was, \\'yes, but it\\'s the u.s.,\\'\\nas if there\\'s no violence here.\"\\n\\ndafri lately wrote the screenplay for \"mesrine,\" which just\\nopened to good reviews that noted its americanness. about a\\nreal-life french gangster of the 1960s and \\'70s, jacques mesrine,\\nwho became a kind of populist outlaw, a french pretty boy floyd,\\nthe movie has a definite political undercurrent. dafri said he\\nlooked to francis ford coppola and martin scorsese, to showtime and\\n\"prison break,\" \"24\" and \"the sopranos.\"\\n\\n\"in the united states,\" he said, \"you know how to make films\\nand television series that are intelligent and political and don\\'t\\nforget the entertainment factor. in france we just want to be\\nintellectual.\" he nearly leaped out of his seat saying that last\\nword.\\n\\nemmanuel dauce, a producer of \"la commune,\" who was joining\\ndafri for morning coffee, nodded. \"we still have an old left that\\nthinks it\\'s vulgar and politically dubious to make commercial\\nmovies,\" he said. \"we invented the dramatic series, with zola and\\nbalzac and hugo, but it\\'s as if we forgot what we started.\"\\n\\nback at the offices of haut et court, the production company for\\n\"entre les murs,\" benjo agreed, while also bemoaning\\nscreenwriting, which accounts here for far less of a film\\'s budget\\non average than in hollywood.\\n\\n\"we prefer to euphemize, to think small in our movies,\" she\\nsaid. she returned to the legacy of the new wave, saying it has\\nbeen misunderstood. new wave filmmakers were against long-winded\\nscripts, but not against well-written ones.\\n\\n\"look at the french films that sell on the international\\nmarket, and you\\'ll also see they aren\\'t always the best ones, but\\nthey\\'re the ones that fit the expectations of french cinema,\" her\\ncolleague, carole scotta, another producer of \"entre les murs,\"\\nadded. \"we\\'re prisoners of these expectations.\"\\n\\n\"and yes, we just don\\'t want to see ourselves as we really\\nare,\" she said. \"it took a long time for politicians here to\\nadmit france bore responsibility for the years of collaboration\\nduring world war ii, and still sarkozy likes to say we were a\\nnation of resistance. the most successful films in this country\\nreflect our collective projection of france as we wish it to be. we\\nprefer to live in a dream.\"\\n\\nthe other evening parisians mobbed the pathe multiplex on the\\nplace de clichy. many lined up to catch woody allen\\'s \"vicky\\ncristina barcelona,\"

-- sometimes a\\nsingle word, uttered in a live broadcast. the new policy, which a\\nfederal appeals court struck down last year, has had a chilling\\neffect on important speech.\\n\\nthe fcc has turned itself into a censorship board that imposes\\nfines based on its own highly subjective standards. it declared\\nthat a golden globes award show, in which the singer bono uttered\\none vulgar word, was indecent. it fined a small public television\\nstation in california for airing martin scorsese\\'s documentary\\n\"the blues,\" which contains musicians using some earthy language.\\nthe commission has decided that other programming with similar\\nlanguage is not indecent.\\n\\nthis regime is a serious threat to free expression and\\nconstitutionally protected speech. just as troubling, broadcasters\\nare engaging in self-censorship -- refraining from airing speech\\nthat should be protected out of fear of facing fcc fines based on\\nvague rules.\\n\\nthe new york-based 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals held that\\nthe fcc\\'s \"fleeting expletives\" policy is arbitrary and\\ncapricious -- and therefore invalid. the fcc\\'s decision to abandon\\nits more lenient policy was not properly reasoned, the court ruled.\\n\\nthe 2nd circuit\\'s decision is correct, and the supreme court\\nshould affirm it. however, there also are important constitutional\\nlaw issues at stake, which the appeals court did not reach. the fcc\\nis penalizing broadcasters for airing speech protected by the first\\namendment. the vague standards it has adopted do not meet\\nconstitutional muster.\\n\\nwe hope the next president will appoint commissioners with a\\ngreater respect for the first amendment. until that happens, the\\nsupreme court must ensure that the fcc does not trample on\\nfree-speech rights.\\n\\nso little time, so much damage\\n\\nwhile americans eagerly vote for the next president, here\\'s a\\nsobering reminder: as of tuesday, george w. bush still has 77 days\\nleft in the white house -- and he\\'s not wasting a minute.\\n\\npresident bush\\'s aides have been scrambling to change rules and\\nregulations on the environment, civil liberties and abortion rights\\namong others -- few for the good. most presidents put on a\\nlast-minute policy stamp, but in bush\\'s case it is more like a\\nwrecking ball. we fear it could take months, or years, for the next\\npresident to identify and then undo all of the damage.\\n\\nhere is a look -- by no means comprehensive -- at some of bush\\'s\\nrecent parting gifts and those we fear are yet to come:\\n\\ncivil liberties:\\n\\nwe don\\'t know all of the ways that the administration has\\nviolated americans\\' rights in the name of fighting terrorism. last\\nmonth, attorney general michael mukasey rushed out new guidelines\\nfor the fbi that permit agents to use chillingly intrusive\\ntechniques to collect information on americans even where there is\\nno evidence of wrongdoing.\\n\\nagents will be allowed to use informants to infiltrate lawful\\ngroups, engage in prolonged physical surveillance and lie about\\ntheir identity while questioning a subject\\'s neighbors, relatives,\\nco-workers and friends. the changes also give the fbi -- which has a\\nlong history of spying on civil rights groups and others -- expanded\\nlatitude to use these techniques on people identified by racial,\\nethnic and religious background.\\n\\nthe administration showed further disdain for americans\\' privacy\\nrights and for congress\\' power by making clear that it will ignore\\na provision in the legislation that established the department of\\nhomeland security. the law requires the department\\'s privacy\\nofficer to account annually for any activity that could affect\\namericans\\' privacy -- and clearly stipulates that the report cannot\\nbe edited by any other officials at the department or the white\\nhouse.\\n\\nthe justice department\\'s office of legal counsel has released a\\nmemo asserting that the law \"does not prohibit\" officials from\\nhomeland security or the white house from reviewing the report. the\\nmemo then argues that since the law allows the officials to review\\nthe report, it would be unconstitutional to stop them from changing\\nit. george orwell couldn\\'t have done better.\\n\\nthe environment\\n\\nthe administration has been especially busy weakening\\nregulations that promote clean air and clean water and protect\\nendangered species.\\n\\nbush, or more to the point vice president dick cheney, came to\\noffice determined to dismantle bill clinton\\'s environmental legacy,\\nundo decades of environmental law and keep their friends in\\nindustry happy. they have had less success than we feared, but only\\nbecause of the determined opposition of environmental groups,\\ncourageous members of congress and protests from citizens. but the\\nwhite house keeps trying.\\n\\nbush\\'s secretary of the interior, dirk kempthorne, has recently\\ncarved out significant exceptions to regulations requiring expert\\nscientific review of any federal project that might harm endangered\\nor threatened species (one consequence will be to relieve the\\nagency of the need to assess the impact of global warming on\\nat-risk species). the department also is rushing to remove the gray\\nwolf from the endangered species list -- again. the wolves were\\nre-listed after a federal judge ruled the government had not lived\\nup to its own recovery plan.\\n\\nin coming weeks, we expect the environmental protection agency\\nto issue a final rule that would weaken a program created by the\\nclean air act, which requires utilities to install modern pollution\\ncontrols when they upgrade their plants to produce more power. the\\nagency is also expected to issue a final rule that would make it\\neasier for coal-fired power plants to locate near national parks in\\ndefiance of longstanding congressional mandates to protect air\\nquality in areas of special natural or recreational value.\\n\\ninterior is also awaiting epa\\'s concurrence on a proposal that\\nwould make it easier for mining companies to dump toxic mine wastes\\nin valleys and streams.\\n\\nand while no rules changes are at issue, the interior department\\nalso has been rushing to open up millions of acres of pristine\\nfederal land to oil-and-gas exploration. we fear that in coming\\nweeks, kempthorne will open up even more acreage to the commercial\\ndevelopment of oil shale, a hugely expensive and environmentally\\nrisky process that even the oil companies seem in no hurry to\\nbegin. he should not.\\n\\nabortion rights\\n\\nsoon after the election, michael leavitt, the secretary of\\nhealth and human services, is expected to issue new regulations\\naimed at further limiting women\\'s access to abortion,\\ncontraceptives and information about their reproductive health care\\noptions.\\n\\nexisting law allows doctors and nurses to refuse to participate\\nin an abortion. these changes would extend the so-called right to\\nrefuse to a wide range of health care workers and activities\\nincluding abortion referrals, unbiased counseling and provision of\\nbirth control pills or emergency contraception, even for rape\\nvictims.\\n\\nthe administration has taken other disturbing steps in recent\\nweeks. in late september, the irs restored tax breaks for banks\\nthat take big losses on bad loans inherited through acquisitions.\\nnow we learn that jpmorgan chase and others are planning to use\\ntheir bailout funds for mergers and acquisitions, transactions that\\nwill be greatly enhanced by the new tax subsidy.\\n\\none last-minute change bush won\\'t be making: he apparently has\\ndecided not to shut down the prison in guantanamo bay, cuba -- the\\nmost shameful symbol of this administration\\'s disdain for the rule\\nof law.\\n\\nbush has said it should be closed, and his secretary of state,\\ncondoleezza rice, and his secretary of defense, robert gates,\\npushed for it. proposals were prepared, including a plan for\\nsending the real bad guys to other countries for trial. but cheney\\nobjected, and the president has refused even to review the memos.\\nhe will hand this mess off to his successor.\\n\\nwe suppose there is some good news in all of this. while bush\\nleaves office on jan. 20, 2009, he has only until nov. 20 of this\\nyear to issue \"economically significant\" rule changes and until\\ndec. 20 to issue other changes. anything after that is merely a\\ndraft and can be easily withdrawn by the next president.\\n\\nunfortunately, the white house is well aware of those deadlines.\\n\\neditors:\\n\\ngood morning. the new york

2008\\n\\neditors:\\n\\nthe iranian parliament voted to dismiss a top\\nminister on tuesday, in a setback for president mahmoud ahmadinejad\\neight months before he faces presidential elections.\\n\\nthe parliament dismissed the official, ali kordan, the interior\\nminister, after he admitted to faking his university degree and\\ntried to bribe members of parliament not to impeach him.\\n\\nthe dismissal underlines the assertiveness of the parliament at\\na time ahmadinejad is struggling to cope with a growing economic\\ncrisis. inflation is running at 30 percent and falling oil prices\\nin a country that has the second largest known oil reserves in the\\nworld are undermining the budget.\\n\\nanalysts said the vote confirmed the division between\\nconservative forces in iranian politics ahead of the presidential\\nvote in june next year when ahmadinejad faces re-election.\\n\\nout of 247 present at the vote in parliament, 188 members voted\\nto dismiss kordan while only 45 legislators voted against his\\ndismissal. fourteen members abstained.\\n\\nthe dismissal means that ahmadinejad must now submit his whole\\ncabinet to a vote of confidence before parliament.\\n\\naccording to the rules of the country\\'s constitution, if 10\\ncabinet members are dismissed, all members must face a confidence\\nvote, and in the past three years ahmadinejad had already dismissed\\nnine cabinet members because they disagreed with his policies.\\n\\nno president has faced a confidence vote on the entire cabinet.\\n\\nmembers of parliament had questioned the qualifications of\\nkordan when ahmadinejad nominated him for the post in august. the\\nprevious minister had been dismissed because of his differences\\nwith the president.\\n\\nkordan claimed to have been awarded an honorary doctorate from\\noxford university. but a parliamentary investigation found not only\\nthat kordan\\'s ph.d. was a fake, but also that he had neither the\\nbachelor\\'s nor master\\'s degrees from an iranian university he had\\nclaimed.\\n\\nthe scandal over his impeachment turned into a crisis on\\nwednesday when a government official, muhammad abbassi, distributed\\n$5,000 checks among parliamentary ministers who had signed the\\nimpeachment motion.\\n\\nthe weekly news magazine shahrvand emrooz reported that abbassi\\ngave the checks as a donation for the legislators\\' local mosques\\nbut asked them to sign two receipts.\\n\\none of those receipts was for a letter to the speaker of\\nparliament asking for the impeachment to be dropped. ali asghar\\nzarei, a legislator close to ahmadinejad, slapped abbassi in the\\nface, and the speaker expelled the official from parliament. later,\\nabbassi was dismissed by ahmadinejad, who said he would not bother\\nto appear in parliament to defend his minister.\\n\\n\"who cares even if mr. kordan\\'s degree is fake?\" the islamic\\nrepublic news agency quoted ahmadinejad as asking. \"i have already\\nsaid that it is just a torn piece of paper because it was only an\\nhonorary degree.\"\\n\\nahmadinejad had said he did not consider the impeachment legal\\nbecause kordan had done nothing wrong.\\n\\none member of parliament, avaz heidarpour, wrote a public letter\\nto the president saying that he could have won millions of votes by\\ndismissing kordan and that his support of the minister would\\ninstead cost him those votes, the daily newspaper etemad reported\\nmonday.\\n\\nthe powerful post of speaker of parliament is held by a rival to\\nahmadinejad, ali larijani, a conservative and an ardent advocate of\\niran\\'s nuclear program. he was also close to kordan but was also\\nseen as someone who is more pragmatic than ahmadinejad in his\\napproach and perhaps willing to engage in diplomacy with the west.\\n\\nthe swiss banking giant ubs reported a third-quarter net\\nprofit on tuesday but warned that the outlook for the rest of the\\nyear was gloomy.\\n\\nthe bank, which is struggling to restore its business and\\nreputation after it was caught up in the collapse of the mortgage\\nmarket, reported a net profit of 296 million swiss francs ($252\\nmillion), compared with a year-earlier loss of 858 million francs.\\noperating income fell 38 percent to 5.6 billion francs.\\n\\nthe bank also predicted that the \"difficult\" conditions seen\\nin october would continue to weigh on its business, and said it\\nwould continue to cut operating expenses where possible.\\n\\nubs\\' reputation as one of the world\\'s most conservative banks\\nwas left in tatters after its bets on the mortgage securities\\nmarket in the united states went spectacularly wrong. it has now\\nwritten down nearly $49 billion since the start of the credit\\ncrisis, including $4.4 billion in the latest quarter. losses and\\nwrite-downs by banks worldwide are approaching $700 billion since\\nthe start of last year.\\n\\nthe results were in line with expectations, as the bank had\\ngiven investors an update on oct. 16. on that day, the swiss\\ngovernment announced a deal to inject 6 billion francs into ubs, a\\nmove that will give it a 9 percent stake in the bank.\\n\\nthe government also agreed to help move up to $60 billion of\\nilliquid securities and other assets from ubs\\'s balance sheet to a\\nseparate fund. ubs said the deal to clean up its balance sheet\\n\"caps future potential losses from these assets\" and greatly\\nreduced the amount of risk it carried. the bank said it now had a\\ntier-1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, of 10.8\\npercent, in line with its european peers.\\n\\nubs actually posted on tuesday an operating loss of 480 million\\nfrancs, but it said its results had been improved by a gain of 2.2\\nbillion francs it booked on its own debt, as well as a tax credit\\nof 913 million francs. it noted that the value of its debt has\\nrisen the bailout was announced, so it could end up having to book\\na loss on that item in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nthe bank said clients continued to desert its wealth management\\nbusiness in the third quarter, with net outflows of 49.3 billion\\nfrancs. clients of its global asset management business withdrew a\\nnet 34.4 billion francs. but it said there had been some\\nimprovement in the businesses since the government bailout was\\nannounced. shares of ubs have fallen about 60 percent this year. on\\ntuesday, they fell 4.3 percent in early zurich trading.\\n\\nchinese and taiwanese officials signed agreements on\\ntuesday expanding charter flights, maritime shipping and\\ncooperation on food safety issues, bringing their governments\\ncloser together as both struggle to overcome economic slowdowns.\\n\\nthe agreements were finalized on the second day of a planned\\nfive-day visit to taiwan by a mainland delegation led by chen\\nyunlin, the head of the association for relations across the taiwan\\nstrait, the main negotiating body for china in matters related to\\ntaiwan.\\n\\nchen is the most senior chinese communist party official to\\nvisit taiwan since 1949, when the kuomintang lost the chinese civil\\nwar and occupied taiwan while in retreat. the mainland chinese\\ngovernment considers taiwan a rebel province that must be restored\\nto china. many taiwanese prefer to maintain the status quo while\\nothers lobby strongly to move toward formal independence.\\n\\ntaiwan\\'s economic growth has lagged behind china\\'s in recent\\nyears, spurring the taiwanese last march to elect ma ying-jeou, a\\nlong-time kuomintang politician, as president. ma ran on a platform\\nof improving the economy through closer ties with the mainland. the\\npresidential election and an earlier parliamentary election were\\nseen as referendums on the policies of chen shui-bian, the former\\npresident whose family members are accused of corruption and whose\\nparty, the democratic progressive party, leans toward taiwanese\\nindependence.\\n\\nthe agreements reached on tuesday were a result of the attempts\\nmade by ma\\'s government at engagement with the mainland. in june,\\njust after he was inaugurated, ma sent a delegation to beijing to\\nsign an agreement establishing a regular weekend schedule of\\ncharter flights between china and taiwan.\\n\\nma\\'s popularity has plummeted in recent months, partly based on\\ncriticism that he is giving away too much to china, but he pushed\\nforward with a second round of talks.\\n\\nthe new transportation agreement raises to 108 from 36 the\\nnumber of weekly round-trip charter flights, according to a summary\\nof the agreement posted on a web site run by the taiwanese\\ngovernment. the flights are expected to run daily, with 21 cities\\non the mainland and eight in taiwan receiving service.\\n\\nthe planes will also fly in a direct line between cities over a\\nroute north of taiwan. charter flights between china and taiwan\\ncurrently take a longer route through hong kong airspace because of\\nsecurity concerns.\\n\\nunder the new routing, direct flights between taipei and beijing\\nwill take two hours, and flights between taipei and shanghai will\\ntake 80 minutes.\\n\\nchina and taiwan will add direct cargo charter flights as well,\\nwith 60 scheduled per month.\\n\\nthe two governments will also open direct shipping channels for\\npassengers and cargo. china will open a total of 63 ports (48\\nseaports and 15 riverports), and taiwan will open 11. to avoid\\npolitical sensitivities, ships will not fly national flags.\\n\\nthe two governments also agreed to expand free exchange of\\ninformation regarding food safety issues. if any product is\\nconsidered faulty or dangerous, a government will recall it and\\nhalt its shipment, according to the agreement.\\n\\ndiscussion of the issue arose because mainland china has been\\ngrappling with its biggest food safety crisis in years. in\\nseptember, chinese dairy products were discovered to have been\\ncontaminated with melamine, a toxic chemical used in plastics that\\nhas been regularly and illegally added to dairy products and animal\\nfeed to falsify a high protein count. at least four infants have\\ndied and 53,000 children have fallen ill from kidney complications\\nresulting from melamine. suspect chinese foods have been recalled\\naround the world, including in taiwan.\\n\\nchina and taiwan also agreed to start direct mail service.\\n\\n\"with the four agreements, direct transport and mail services\\nthat compatriots on both sides have been longing for over the past\\n30 years have become a reality, and will provide more convenient\\nchannels for cross-straits economic exchanges,\" chen said on\\ntuesday, according to xinhua, the official state news agency of\\nmainland china.\\n\\nchen met on monday and tuesday with his taiwanese counterpart,\\nchiang pin-kung, head of the straits exchange foundation. after the\\nagreements were signed on tuesday, the two appeared together and\\nheld up large books containing the signatures.\\n\\nchen\\'s arrival on monday was marked by a handful of protests.\\ndemocratic progressive party supporters have loudly denounced\\nchen\\'s visit, and one of his mainland colleagues was knocked to the\\nground by a taiwanese politician while on a recent visit to the\\nconfucius temple in the southern city of tainan, where the party\\nhas strong support. the south of taiwan has a committed\\npro-independence leaning.\\n\\nchen also said tuesday that the mainland will give taiwan two\\npandas as gifts before the year\\'s end. in exchange, chen will\\naccept two rare animals from taiwan: an endangered goat and a\\nspotted deer.\\n\\ncox news service\\n\\ndavie, fla. - while his teammates enjoyed the day off, dolphins\\nreceiver greg camarillo put in a few minutes\\' work, conducting a\\nnews conference at training camp, where the first question was:\\nwhen was the last time he conducted a news conference?\\n\\nthe self-deprecating camarillo flashed a\\nyou\\'ve-got-to-be-kidding-me grin while taking an unfamiliar place\\nbehind the lectern. mindful that camarillo has 43 receptions,\\nsomeone asked if this is his best season in football, to which\\ncamarillo pretended to assess matters carefully before reminding\\neveryone he had roughly 46 catches at stanford in his career.\\n\\n\"so, yes,\" he concluded, evoking more laughter.\\n\\nthe upbeat mood came thanks to a 26-17 victory at denver on\\nsunday that left miami 4-4 and in the thick of playoff contention.\\nif that\\'s a stunning statement following a 1-15 disaster last year,\\nso be it. the dolphins had trotted out the perfect player to\\npersonify how, in half a season, the team has made obsolete so many\\nexpectations it might have had in preseason.\\n\\ncamarillo\\'s goal in july? \"to make the team,\" he said monday.\\n\\nhe quickly added that he has revised that goal, in much the same\\nway the entire team has under first-year coach tony sparano.\\n\\n\"there\\'s nothing to compare, really,\" said camarillo, who\\nprovided the lone highlight last year by scoring the overtime\\ntouchdown against baltimore that averted a winless season. \"it\\'s a\\ncompletely different team, completely different mentally. you can\\nkind of see that late in the game.\\n\\n\"last year we would have found a way to lose the game, as\\nopposed to this year, we find a way to win games. that\\'s what good\\nteams do.\"\\n\\na turning point, camarillo said, might have occurred a couple of\\nweeks ago, when sparano asked some players to address the group,\\nincluding tight end anthony fasano, who used a word that until then\\nseemed taboo.\\n\\n\"he said, \\'why don\\'t we talk about the playoffs? it\\'s something\\nthat\\'s not spoken about. guys have it as a goal, but we don\\'t\\nreally talk about it much in the locker room.\"\\'\\n\\nthey do now.\\n      \"we need to expect it,\" camarillo said. \"we need to reach for\\nit.\"\\n      which is exactly what sparano wants to hear.\\n\\nrather than having to prop up players\\' psyches after moral\\nvictories that are real-life losses, as was the case last year for\\ncoach cam cameron, sparano finds himself in a critic\\'s role,\\npointing out shortcomings. this week, he found that job pretty\\ntough.\\n\\n\"we\\'re supposed to look at these wins and talk about how we can\\ndo better,\" sparano said. \"on the defensive side of the ball, i\\nthought that yesterday, it was hard to find some things that\\nweren\\'t really good.\"\\n\\nalthough the offense sputtered at times, it produced a 15-play,\\n80-yard touchdown drive in crunch time, much like camarillo\\nrecorded one of the most productive receiving days in dolphins\\nhistory.\\n\\na man who originally wanted to just protect his job finds\\nhimself no. 11 in the nfl in number of receptions - ahead of randy\\nmoss, lee evans and terrell owens - and no. 28 in receiving yards\\nwith 483 - just behind wes welker but ahead of braylon edwards,\\nplaxico burress and, yes, terrell owens.\\n\\nsparano said the time for him to learn what camarillo can do is\\npast.\\n\\n\"i have a pretty clear understanding of what camarillo is all\\nabout,\" sparano said. \"he\\'s a hard guy not to like.\"\\n\\nequally important, the coaches have an understanding of the\\nreceivers as a whole. ted ginn had 175 yards in receptions a week\\nago against buffalo, but with denver rotating a safety to\\ndouble-cover ginn, the dolphins had no problem leaning on\\ncamarillo.\\n\\n\"no disrespect to any of my players - i love them all - but\\nthere\\'s no star in that group,\" sparano said. \"they all know that\\nthey have a role and from day 1 we\\'ve said that we\\'re trying to\\ndefine those roles. i think we\\'ve done that.\"\\n\\nimperfections, of course, remain. sparano said the run-blocking\\nwas often ineffective sunday, the team settled for field goals when\\nit could have scored touchdowns, and third-and-long situations\\nremain troublesome.\\n\\nbut if anything symbolizes an evolving attitude, it might be a\\nbruise one of the dolphins placed on sparano in the mayhem of a\\nsuccessful fourth-down conversion on the decisive drive.\\n\\n\"i did get a couple of slaps and smacks,\" sparano said. \"i\\ngot a big bruise on my arm.\"\\n\\nhal habib writes for the palm beach post. e-mail: hal underscore\\nhabib at pbpost.com.\\n\\ncox news service\\n\\ndear dr.

sure without asking her, but\\nmy best guess follows:\\n\\ndefense mechanisms are strategies or manners in which we behave\\nor think to protect or \"defend\" ourselves from painful thoughts\\nor feelings.\\n\\nwe all use them periodically in an attempt to deal with the\\nworld around us. utilizing these defenses appropriately can be\\nuseful and helpful. however, all too often, their usefulness is\\nextended beyond the boundaries of good mental health.\\n\\nlet\\'s look at three of these defense mechanisms in their more\\nunhealthy forms:\\n\\n--?rationalization is a defense mechanism that involves\\nexplaining an unacceptable behavior or feeling in a rational or\\nlogical manner that avoids the true explanation for the behavior.\\n\\nmaking excuses to justify behavior includes such examples as\\n\"my children behave the way they do because this is the standard\\nthat society now promotes and accepts\"; \"i don\\'t exercise because\\ndoing so is not possible with my busy schedule, and i am always so\\nsore the next day i can\\'t get out of bed\"; and \"i have fallen in\\nlove with another person because i never really loved my husband.\"\\n\\n-- denial is a commonly used defense mechanism that can lead to\\nreal problems. these include avoiding the truth, acknowledging only\\npart of a bigger situation or leaving out important information.\\n\\nexamples are \"just because i am overdrawn at the bank and over\\nmy credit limit on credit cards doesn\\'t mean i can\\'t manage my\\nmoney\"; and \"i haven\\'t been depressed all of these years -- my\\nmoods are simply a reflection of my situation.\"\\n\\n--?intellectualization is used in an attempt to avoid reality\\nand psychological pain by taking a very abstract view of the\\nsituation: \"my problems are so complex that only einstein\\'s theory\\nof relativity can explain them\"; or \"i deal with my problems by\\nstudying the lives of successful individuals and how they deal with\\ntheir problems.\"\\n\\ni hope this discussion helps you. if readers find this\\ninformation useful, please tell me and i will discuss other defense\\nmechanisms in future columns.\\n\\nhap lecrone is a

predominantly shiite neighborhood in eastern\\nbaghdad, an improvised explosive device hidden in a fishmonger\\'s\\nstall killed seven and wounded 18 when it exploded early tuesday\\nafternoon.\\n\\na police colonel, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he\\nwas not authorized to speak to reporters, said that the explosion\\nwas caused by a so-called \"sticky ied,\" a small bomb with an\\nadhesive backing that can be unobtrusively attached to the\\nunderside of a car, or even a table.\\n\\n\"i warned this fish seller only yesterday that his stand on the\\nside of the street was not safe because anyone passing by could set\\nan ied to blow him up, along with his customers,\" the police\\ncolonel said. \"he didn\\'t listen, and the poor guy lost his life in\\ntoday\\'s

nov. 9. chart material follows text.      cox news service\\n\\nwashington -- \"hey, the tv\\'s not working!\"\\n\\njust 100 days from sunday, tv viewers in millions of u.s.\\nhouseholds may be startled to discover that most television\\nstations have turned off their analog broadcast signals, leaving\\nolder tv sets blank unless they\\'re tethered to cable, satellite\\ndishes or digital converter boxes.\\n\\nbroadcasters and government officials are trying to warn\\namericans about the dawning of the digital tv age on feb. 17, but\\ncritics say those efforts may be inadequate for many of the 13.4\\nmillion households without pay tv.\\n\\n\"it would appear there will be a lot of people whose tv sets\\nwill go blank,\" said mark cooper, research director of the\\nconsumer federation of america.\\n\\nother confused viewers may end up spending far more money than\\nnecessary to cope with analog tv tuners that no longer can receive\\nbroadcast signals. unfortunately, \"a lot of people will spend more\\nmoney than they actually need to, because cable advertising is\\npushing them to get $600-a-year cable service when people could\\nsolve the problem with a $50 box,\" cooper said.\\n\\nsupporters of the digital age say that all tv viewers will start\\ngetting better pictures and sound, as well as more programming\\nchoices. moreover, by abandoning analog signals, broadcasters will\\ncreate more radio spectrum to be used for public safety\\ncommunications and advanced wireless services.\\n\\ncooper said the government has made the right decision, because\\nemergency responders really do need more communications\\ncapabilities. \"it was time to move on,\" he said.\\n\\nnow, the government is working hard to get the word out to the\\nestimated 12 percent of households whose only access to tv is via a\\nhome antenna and whose older sets aren\\'t equipped with a digital\\ntuner to handle the new signals.\\n\\nfor those viewers, the choice is to subscribe to a pay tv\\nservice, buy a new set, or buy a converter box to make their\\npresent set digital-ready.\\n\\nthe federal government is providing $40 coupons to reduce the\\ncost of the converter boxes. the coupons typically push down the\\nprice of a box to about $20 or even less at major chains such as\\nwal-mart, sears and best buy.\\n\\nat a senate commerce committee hearing into the dtv transition\\nin september, federal communications commission chairman kevin\\nmartin said the people most in need of help are \"senior citizens,\\nnon-english speakers and minorities, people with disabilities,\\nlow-income consumers, and those living in rural or tribal areas.\"\\n\\ncommittee chairman daniel inouye, d-hawaii, urged the fcc and\\nthe national telecommunications and information administration\\n(ntia) to work harder to make sure the new white house and congress\\ndo not immediately face a \"communications crisis. we have too many\\ncrises facing us at the moment.\"\\n\\nmartin said fcc officials are now better prepared because of a\\ntest run they began sept. 8 in wilmington, n.c. local broadcasters\\nthere turned off their analog signals and now send only digital\\nsignals to the area\\'s 400,000 viewers.\\n\\nthe test generally has been viewed as a success. retailers had\\nenough converter boxes on hand, and local broadcasters tried hard\\nto educate viewers. still, officials found that many older people\\nneeded help hooking up their converter boxes, adjusting their\\nantennas or scanning channels, and some viewers could not afford\\nthe boxes even with the subsidy coupons.\\n\\nto reach the poor and elderly before their tvs go blank on feb.\\n17, government needs the \"commitment of the local community,\\nincluding local industry, governmental and nongovernmental\\norganizations,\" martin said.\\n\\nfor months, ntia has been mailing out converter-box coupons.\\nstill, consumer groups fear ntia could be swamped by a surge in\\ncoupon requests as the conversion approaches.\\n\\neven after every viewer has cable, a converter or a new tv,\\nthere still will be problems.\\n\\nmany people may find they have fallen off the so-called\\n\"digital cliff.\" people who receive a weak analog signal still\\ncan view programming, even if it\\'s less than perfectly clear. but\\nwith digital tuners, when a signal gets too weak, it \"drops off a\\ncliff\" and disappears entirely.\\n\\naccording to the dtv transition coalition, if your tv was built\\nbefore 1998, you can assume it lacks a built-in digital tuner. if\\nit was built after 2004, it likely does have a digital tuner,\\nthough that\\'s not a sure thing.\\n\\nthe coalition says the best way to determine whether your tv set\\nhas a built-in digital tuner is to check the owner\\'s manual or the\\nmanufacturer\\'s web site.\\n\\nthe coalition also says owners can look for an input connection\\nlabeled \"digital input\" or \"atsc\" (for advanced television\\nsystems committee, which developed the dtv format).\\n\\ndon\\'t feel reassured just because you own a newer set that was\\nadvertised as \"hd-ready\" or \"hdtv monitor.\" such sets may lack\\nthe internal tuner needed to receive digital broadcasts, even\\nthough they can display digital and high-definition signals once a\\nconverter box or cable connection has converted the signals from\\nanalog.\\n\\ngetting ready for digital broadcasts\\n\\n      owners of analog tv sets have three ways to go after feb. 17:\\n      -- keep the old tv set and hook it to a converter box\\n      -- subscribe to cable, satellite or another pay service\\n      -- buy a modern television with a built-in digital tuner.\\n\\nto help pay for the converter box, the government is providing\\neach household with up to two $40 coupons. there are several ways\\nto apply for a coupon:\\n\\n-- visit the site https://www.dtv2009.gov\\n\\n-- call 1-888-dtv-2009\\n\\n-- write to the coupon program,

but studies show\\nthe divide that separates who does what around the house\\ngender-wise is slowly coming down.\\n\\nincreasingly, you can find couples such as eric and tracy\\nwernli, whose tag-team

coontz of the council on contemporary families points\\nto a number of surveys that reflect the shifts in the american\\nlandscape. from 1997 to\\n\\n2003, the gender gap in hours devoted to housework fell by more\\nthan 70 percent, she says.\\n\\nthe \\'90s saw big increases in the number of hours men spent in\\ncooking and child care. in 1992, only 2 percent of households\\nevinced \"cooking equality\" between men and women; by 2002 it was\\nup to was 12 percent.\\n\\nthis was especially true, she says, in homes where the women\\nworked full time, but the increase in men\\'s domestic involvement\\nhas spilled over into traditional households where the wife stays\\nhome.\\n\\n\"we\\'ve seen real changes,\" says coontz, who largely attributes\\nthe rise in men helping out to the influx of women into the work\\nforce. \"we\\'ve all had to sit down and think through these kinds of\\nissues in a way no previous generation bothered to do.\"\\n\\nare egalitarian marriages truly happier? francine m. deutsch,\\nprofessor of psychology at mount holyoke college and author of\\n\"halving it all: how equally shared parenting works,\" says\\ngauging marital happiness is tricky: most people are loathe to\\nreport they\\'re unhappy. but when she asked wives how often they\\nbecome angry, women in traditional marriages report a significantly\\nhigher level of anger.\\n\\n\"but the most unhappy people in the entire sample were the\\nwomen who were working fulltime and doing 75 percent of the work at\\nhome,\" she says. their husbands were unhappy, too, she adds. so\\nmuch

the presidential race and the\\nperformance of our own industry. they\\'re revealing.\\n\\n-- 72: percentage of albany-area residents who read the times\\nunion newspaper or our web site every month, according to new data\\nfrom scarborough research. that puts us in the top 10 newspapers\\nnationally for readership growth.\\n\\nah, you say, but i read that newspapers\\' daily circulation is\\ndropping. well, yes: people don\\'t interact with news sources the\\nway they used to. they\\'re not watching the evening newscasts,\\nlistening to radio reports or picking up the paper every day, but\\nmore people are checking our web site several times a day. that\\nhelps account for the varying numbers.\\n\\naround the country, in fact, publishers are intentionally\\ntrimming that daily circulation number by focusing on their core\\nmarkets rather than outlying areas and on the days of the week when\\npeople read more. what\\'s dropping is known as \"vanity\\ncirculation,\" and in its place is an effort to get papers into the\\nhands of real news consumers (the demographic our advertisers most\\nwant to reach, too).\\n\\n-- 0.25 and 1.11: percentage of increase in times union\\ncirculation over the last six months on sunday and saturday,\\nrespectively, according to data released by the audit bureau of\\ncirculation. that underscores the migration to late-in-the-week\\nreadership. it\\'s the fifth straight half-year reporting period in\\nwhich this newspaper has reported growing circulation -- a streak\\nmatched by only one other newspaper in the country. don\\'t tell me\\nthere\\'s not a great future for print journalism in this market.\\n\\n-- $121 billion, $56 billion: the first number is the total new\\nyork state budget. the second is what gov. david paterson says the\\nstate actually has to spend, once you pull out direct aid to\\nlocalities and spending mandated by the federal government.\\n\\nin an editorial board meeting here, paterson discussed\\nprojections that the state will run $1.5 billion short of revenue\\nin the current fiscal year and face a deficit of $12.5 billion in\\nthe fiscal year that begins next april 1. in weighing the depth of\\nthe state fiscal crisis created by the economic meltdown, then, the\\n$14 billion in cuts confronting paterson and legislators needs to\\nbe compared against not the total state budget, but the smaller\\nfigure our lawmakers actually can control. so paterson wants\\nwashington to come up with a second stimulus package, this one\\naimed at hard-hit states.\\n\\n-- $86.9 billion: that\\'s how much less money new york got from\\nthe federal government last year than we sent to washington in\\ntaxes. no wonder paterson says more of it should be sent back now.\\nthe financial crisis has hit the state that is home to wall street\\nharder than anywhere else. the three states that get the biggest\\npayback from the feds: south carolina (whose

competitions, but get\\na load of this midlife reality check: you could be losing muscle\\nmass and strength - a condition called sarcopenia - if you don\\'t\\nconsume enough high-quality protein on a daily basis.\\n\\n\"we\\'re seeing sarcopenia, which commonly occurs in the elderly,\\nin younger subjects in their early to mid-50s,\" said susan\\nhewlings, a registered dietitian and assistant professor at stetson\\nuniversity in florida who specializes in protein metabolism.\\nhewlings and other researchers presenting at the 2008 american\\ndietetic association\\'s annual food and nutrition conference shed\\nnew light on the connection between what we eat and the health of\\nour aging muscles. bottom line: research shows that to prevent and\\ntreat lost muscle mass you must consume 1.5 grams of protein for\\nevery kilogram of body weight per day. that translates to about 90\\ngrams of protein a day for a normal weight man and would be less if\\nyou\\'re a tiny gal.\\n\\nbreakfast, lunch, dinner\\n\\nbut here\\'s where the real specific advice kicks in: you should\\nbe including sources of high-quality protein such as eggs, milk and\\nmeats and balancing your protein intake throughout the day.\\n\\n\"typically, people eat less protein at breakfast, a little more\\nat lunch and then eat a lot at dinner,\" hewlings said. \"to\\noptimize protein synthesis and prevent sarcopenia, it needs to be\\nmore evenly distributed.\" there goes that diet plan to starve all\\nday and splurge on a big steak for dinner. your muscles are hungry\\nfor amino acids found in protein foods all day long.\\n\\nin fact, robert wolfe, professor of geriatrics at the university\\nof arkansas for medical sciences in little rock, warns that \"when\\nthere are periods of the day when no amino acids are being absorbed\\nfrom the gut, muscle serves as the only significant reservoir of\\nprotein.\"\\n\\nthat means your body starts robbing the muscles of stored\\nprotein to keep organs and other tissues humming along. so make\\nsure you\\'re eating protein-containing foods every day and including\\nprotein in each meal. and that includes snacks. something as simple\\nas fresh apple slices topped with peanut butter is a good choice.\\n\\nhewlings emphasized that protein alone can\\'t do the job of\\npreserving and building muscles as we age. \"i call exercise the\\n\\'poor man\\'s plastic surgery,\"\\' she said. \"and note that physical\\nactivity boosts lean body mass only if you\\'ve got enough protein in\\nyour diet.\"\\n\\nkeep fat intake down\\n\\nsince foods are often a combination of the three macronutrients\\n(protein, carbohydrates and fat), choose protein-containing foods\\nwisely with other health concerns in mind. for instance, a 6-ounce\\nbroiled porterhouse steak is a great source of complete protein -\\n38 grams - but contains 44 grams of fat. the same amount of salmon\\ngives you 34 grams of protein and 18 grams of fat, and it\\'s the\\nkind of fat that\\'s good for you. for a complete list of protein\\nfoods to include in a healthy diet, go to www.mypyramid.gov.\\n\\ncarolyn o\\'neil is a registered

michael jenkins wasn\\'t a fun matchup for deangelo hall\\non sunday in oakland for a lot of reasons.\\n\\nnot only did jenkins beat his old falcons teammate and friend\\nfor a 37-yard touchdown in a 24-0 rout, he wasn\\'t one to bite on\\nmuch jibber-jabber, either.\\n\\njenkins said their only real exchange came on their first play\\nfrom scrimmage together after the touchdown, when hall gave him a\\n\"ok, you got one.\"\\n\\n\"i just smiled,\" jenkins said.\\n\\njenkins plays it pretty straight, especially for an nfl wide\\nreceiver - no muss or fuss. at times that means he can blend into\\nhis surroundings a little, including the shadow of emerging star\\nreceiver roddy white.\\n\\nbut time after time this season jenkins has stepped out into the\\nspotlight with big plays - from matt ryan\\'s first pass as an nfl\\nquarterback, which jenkins turned into a 62-yard touchdown against\\ndetroit, to his last-second catch to set up the game-winning field\\ngoal against chicago.\\n\\njenkins was back at it sunday with the second two-touchdown game\\nof his career, and first since sept. 30 of last year against\\nhouston. he also caught a 27-yarder from ryan on a corner route.\\n\\n\"i think michael has done a nice job when he has had\\nopportunities for balls to come his way,\" falcons coach mike smith\\nsaid. \"the defense dictates that. if matt throws it in his\\ndirection, he\\'s made the play the majority of the time. he\\'s made\\nsome real big plays.\"\\n\\nfalcons wide receivers coach terry robiskie had his own theory\\nabout jenkins\\' day sunday in which both of his catches went for\\ntouchdowns.\\n\\n\"i think that had a little bit of a buddy, a friend-friend\\nrival to it,\" robiskie said. \"he got fired up matched up against\\nhis buddy. i guess he figured he had to outdo him.\"\\n\\nthat was part of the fun, jenkins concedes. and he\\'s just\\ncontinuing to develop in this offense, trying to take advantage of\\nthe attention going white\\'s way.\\n\\nwhite is leading the falcons with 48 catches, 733 yards and five\\ntouchdowns receiving. jenkins is second in receiving yards (323)\\nand touchdowns (three). he\\'s third in receptions (18) behind\\njerious norwood.\\n\\njenkins\\' 17.9 yards per catch leads the falcons.\\n\\nwhite is fourth in the nfl with those 733 receiving yards.\\n\\n\"that\\'s the big thing about roddy having the year he\\'s\\nhaving,\" robiskie said. \"now all of a sudden we can get in a\\nsituation where they\\'ve got to double roddy, they\\'ve got to put\\ntheir best guy on roddy. if mike ends up with the lesser guy, the\\nthird corner, he\\'s got to win. that\\'s his role. that\\'s what we\\nexpect of him.\"\\n\\nas it turns out, robiskie has quite a few expectations of\\njenkins, and he\\'s not afraid to share them.\\n\\n\"i won\\'t tell you anything that i haven\\'t told him, but every\\nday of our lives with him, we\\'ve got to keep working on being\\nphysical, physical and physical,\" robiskie said. \"being able to\\nfight and beat and get after the other guys. like i tell him, he\\'s\\ntoo much of a pretty boy. mike\\'s too busy right now trying to be a\\nmodel. i think that\\'s what his goal in life is, to catch a couple\\ntouchdowns and then put his face up on the billboard. i think he\\'s\\nhoping some modeling agency picks up on that.\"\\n\\na little harsh? maybe. but it sounds like robiskie doesn\\'t treat\\njenkins any differently than he would - and does - his own son.\\n\\nrobiskie\\'s son brian is a star receiver at ohio state, where\\njenkins started for three years. he gets plenty of teasing, too.\\n\\n\"i tell mike and my son, they\\'re like twins, them pretty boys\\nfrom ohio state,\" robiskie said. \"they got to get their hair cut\\nand put some lotion on before the game.\"\\n\\njenkins laughed when told about that last comment. he\\'d heard it\\nbefore.\\n\\nhe knows robiskie wants him to be physical at the line of\\nscrimmage and in the run game. and jenkins seems comfortable in a\\nrole as a receiver in a run-dominated attack.\\n\\n\"we\\'re going to run the football,\" jenkins said. \"when we do\\nthat it opens up the passing game downfield. it\\'s making the most\\nof every ball that comes your way. bring in every catch.\"\\n\\ncarroll rogers writes for the atlanta journal-constitution.\\ne-mail:

non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or 888-603-1036.      dockworker marcy ingall saw a giant wave in the distance last\\ntuesday\\n(10/28) afternoon and stopped in her tracks. it was an hour before\\nlow tide\\nin maine\\'s boothbay harbor, yet without warning, the muddy harbor\\nfloor\\nsuddenly filled with rushing, swirling water.\\n\\nin 15 minutes, the water rose 12 feet, then receded. and then it\\nhappened\\nagain. it occurred three times, she said, each time ripping apart\\ndocks and\\nsplitting wooden pilings.\\n\\n\"it was bizarre,\" said ingall, a lifelong resident of the\\narea.\\n\"everybody was like, \\'oh my god, is this the end?\"\\' it was not\\nthe\\napocalypse, but it was a rare phenomenon, one that has baffled\\nresearchers.\\nthe national weather service said ocean levels rapidly rose in\\nboothbay,\\nsouthport, and bristol in a matter of minutes around 3 p.m. on oct.\\n28 to\\nthe surprise of ocean watchers. exactly what caused the rogue waves\\nremains\\nunknown.\\n\\n\"the cause of it is a mystery,\" said national weather service\\nmeteorologist john jensenius, who first reported the waves from a\\nfield\\noffice in gray, maine. \"but it\\'s not mysterious that it\\nhappened.\"\\n\\nspecialists have posed a variety of possible explanations,\\nsaying the waves\\ncould have been caused by a powerful storm squall or the slumping\\nof\\nmountains of sediment from a steep canyon in the ocean - a sort of\\nmini\\ntsunami. the last time such rogue waves appeared in maine was at\\nbass\\nharbor in 1926.\\n\\njensenius said the occurrence is so unusual, that specialists\\ndon\\'t have a\\nname for the phenomenon.\\n\\n\"that\\'s part of our problem,\" he said.\\n\\na similar occurrence in florida more than 15 years ago continues\\nto baffle\\nresearchers. a series of 12- to 15-foot waves hit daytona beach on\\njuly 3,\\n1992, injuring more than 20 people and lifting and tossing dozens\\nof cars.\\n\\njeff list, an oceanographer at the us geological survey at woods\\nhole said\\nhe and other researchers studied the occurrence, but no one has\\nbeen able\\nto pinpoint the cause. and he said similarly enormous waves\\nappeared once\\non the great lakes.\\n\\ncould such a wave or waves enter boston harbor, or even engulf\\nthe\\nmassachusetts coast?\\n\\n\"it seems a little unlikely one could hit boston,\" list said.\\n\"but then\\nagain, these things are always surprises when they occur.\"\\n\\na squall line surge, which occurs when fast-moving storm winds\\nsweep over\\nwater that is traveling the same speed, can create such a wave.\\n(the speed\\nof waves is directly related to wind speed and the depth of the\\nocean at\\nany given point.)\\n\\nlist and other specialists said such an occurrence is\\nexceedingly rare, but\\nwhen it occurs, \"you get this interaction that causes a large\\nbulge of\\nwater to rise up.\"\\n\\njensenius said that might have been a factor last week, when a\\nmajor storm\\nfront brought rain to most of the east coast, particularly southern\\nnew\\nengland. but he said that does not solve the mystery, adding that\\nhe had\\nnot ruled out a massive \"land slump\" underwater. such slumps can\\ncreate\\nwaves that may be classified as tsunamis, although no where near\\nthe size\\nand scale of the tsunami that occurred in the indian ocean in 2004.\\nthose\\nfast-moving and deadly waves were caused by a massive earthquake.\\n\\ntsunami-like waves may not be as rare on the east coast as most\\npeople\\nthink. jensenius referenced a 2002 article in the international\\njournal of\\nthe tsunami society that called the threat of tsunami and\\ntsunami-like\\nwaves generated in the atlantic ocean \"very real despite a general\\nimpression to the contrary.\"\\n\\nthe article said such waves appear \"in most cases to be the\\nresult of\\nslumping or landsliding associated with earthquakes or with wave\\naction\\nassociated with strong storms.\"\\n\\nexplosive decompression of underwater methane could also be a\\nfactor.\\n\\njensenius said he is trying to gather information on the waves\\nthat hit\\nboothbay harbor, adding that he has asked local businesses such as\\nbanks\\nwhether the event might have been recorded on security videos.\\n\\n\"it could be this or it could be that, but as a science, it is\\nvery\\ndifficult to tie it down,\" he said of the waves.\\n\\nlist also said the waves could have been triggered by the same\\nconditions\\nthat cause a tsunami, including a breaking glacier. rogue waves can\\nresult\\nfrom a tsunami traveling through the ocean that breaks \"down into\\nnumerous\\nwaves.\"\\n\\naccording to the national weather service, no earthquakes or\\nseismic\\nactivity were reported in the area when the boothbay waves\\nappeared. list\\nnoted that there was no seismic reading when the daytona waves\\nstruck.\\n\\ntom lippmann, an oceanographer in the marine sciences department\\nat the\\nuniversity of new hampshire, said he also suspected that the maine\\nwave was\\na squall line surge. the national weather service incorrectly\\ncalled it a\\ntide surge, he said.\\n\\n\"tides in the gulf of maine are essentially driven by celestial\\nbodies\\'\\npull on the earth\\'s water,\" he said. \"they\\'re very well predicted\\nand\\nvery well known.\"\\n\\nresidents and business owners in boothbay said they were glad\\nthe\\nphenomenon didn\\'t happen at high tide, when it might have caused\\nmassive\\nflooding and more extensive damage. janice newell, who lives nearby\\nin head\\nof the harbor, told the local newspaper the rushing water \"was of\\nbiblical\\nproportion.\"\\n\\n\"there were three large whirlpools in the inner harbor, up to\\nwithin a\\nfoot of my neighbor\\'s wall,\" she told the boothbay register. \"it\\nwas\\nbeautiful, but it was scary.\"\\n\\nelena smith, a waitress and part-owner of mcseagull\\'s restaurant\\noverlooking the harbor, said the late-afternoon lunch crowd sat\\nspeechless\\nas the waters rose and receded. she was stunned to see the normally\\nsafe\\nand placid harbor suddenly run like rapids. some residents reported\\nseeing\\nmassive whirlpools of water that disappeared, leaving clam shells\\nand\\nseaweed in vortex patterns on the harbor floor.\\n\\n\"it felt like somebody took the plug out somewhere\" in the\\nocean, smith\\nsaid. \"it felt like there must have been water missing in the\\nocean\\nsomeplace.\"\\n\\nmegan woolhouse can be reached at

dallas morning news website.\\n\\nsince the posting was time-stamped 5 a.m., that \"democratical\"\\nmay well\\nhave been a slip of the sleep-deprived brain, the writer\\'s fingers\\nstretching for the next word - \"presidential\" - before he had\\nfinished\\nthe first.\\n\\nit\\'s not the first time in recent history the typo has seen the\\nlight of\\nday. there\\'s an example in a 2004 commentary at the chattanoogan\\'s\\nwebsite:\\n\"like barack obama said in his democratical national convention\\naddress\\n\\'we are one people.\\' \" and in 1992, the atlanta constitution seems\\nto have\\nendorsed \"democratical presidential nominee bill clinton.\"\\n\\na few decades earlier, though, that democratical wouldn\\'t have\\nraised an\\neyebrow. david k. barnhart, who posted the dallas morning news\\ncitation at\\nlinguistlist.org, the american dialect society\\'s discussion list,\\nnoted\\nthat the oxford english dictionary has examples of the adjective\\nfrom the\\nmid-16th to the mid-18th century, as an everyday variant of\\ndemocratic. a\\n1589 religious tract, for example, says the english church \"is\\nmonarchical\\nin regard of our head, christ; aristocratical in the eldership; and\\ndemocratical in the people.\"\\n\\nand america proved just as hospitable to the long form of the\\nadjective.\\n\"aristotle, and other grecian political writers, recognized but\\nthree\\nspecies of government: the monarchical, the aristocratical and the\\ndemocratical,\" wrote a contributor to the american whig review in\\n1847.\\n\\nwith the adjective already in circulation, it\\'s only natural\\nthat the\\ndemocratic party\\'s members and sympathizers would now and then be\\ncalled\\ndemocratical, as in an 1856 essay on political loyalty in the\\nnational era:\\n\"we leave to democratical newspaper-writers \\'to go through thick\\nand thin\\nfor the party.\\' \"\\n\\nunlike today\\'s \"democrat party,\" democratical doesn\\'t seem to\\nhave been a\\nterm of abuse. in 1873, the nation mentioned \"the extreme\\ndemocratical\\nparty.\" in 1908, the newark (ohio) advocate reported that \"the\\ndemocratical congressional convention of the seventeenth district\\nopened\\nauspiciously.\" (that could, of course, be the same sort of slip as\\n\"democratical presidential.\") in 1924, the mexia daily news, in\\ntexas,\\ncomplained that \"fundamentalists call the liberal anti-christ and\\nold\\nfogey republican calls the democratical and the progressive red.\"\\n\\nbut democratical gradually faded away. when, exactly, it began\\nto sound odd\\nis hard to say: reporting that a local worthy had \"resigned from\\nthe\\ndemocratical committee\" might have been standard usage at the\\nstatesville,\\nn.c., standard in 1947. but when, in 1960, the chicago tribune\\ncalled\\nkennedy \"the democratical presidential nominee,\" the adjective\\nwas more\\nlikely a typist\\'s anticipatory slip, as it is today.\\n\\ndemocratical wasn\\'t the only alternative name for the party\\nduring its\\nearly years. as the 19th century wore on, it was often called\\nsimply, and\\nwarmly, \"the democracy\" (with or without a capital letter). the\\noed\\nquotes the new york herald in 1848: \"the election of 1840 was\\ncarried by\\nfalse charges against the american democracy.\" at the democratic\\nnational\\nconvention of 1852, several state delegations used the name for\\ntheir\\nparty: \"the democracy of pennsylvania hold principles higher than\\nall\\nother considerations.\"\\n\\neven in the 20th century, \"the democracy\" persisted for a\\nwhile. linguist\\ngeoff nunberg, in an essay broadcast on \"fresh air,\" quoted\\nwilliam\\njennings bryan addressing a party gathering in boston in 1902: \"i\\nrecognize . . . how much fidelity it requires to plead for\\ndemocracy in new\\nengland.\"\\n\\nbut by then, the nickname was nearing the end of its run.\\nambrose bierce\\nsneered at it in his 1909 usage handbook - \"one could as properly\\ncall the\\nchristian church \\'the christianity\\' \" - but he was beating a\\nnearly dead\\nhorse. the opposition was about to launch its own nickname, the one\\nwe\\nstill hear today in president bush\\'s references to \"the democrat\\nparty.\"\\n\\nnunberg traced the usage to 1923, when the republican speaker of\\nthe new\\nyork assembly called the opposition \"the democrat party\": hoover\\nused it\\nas well, in 1932, in his campaign against franklin roosevelt. there\\nare\\nearlier instances of the phrase, noted nunberg, but \"it seems to\\nhave been\\nregarded more as a rusticism than as a partisan dig. in 1908, a wag\\nused it\\nin a poem accusing william jennings bryan of being a\\nflip-flopper\":\\n\\n\"nothin\\' at all to say, william; nothin\\' at all to say;\\n\\nthere ain\\'t no democrat party, so go on and have your way.\"\\n\\ndemocrats today are still annoyed by \"democrat party,\"\\nespecially those\\nwho remember it as a favorite epithet of senator joseph mccarthy.\\nbut slurs\\ndon\\'t always work as intended, and the republican overuse of\\n\"democrat\\nparty\" may actually be neutralizing its sting. pronounced with a\\ntexas\\ntwang, especially, it\\'s beginning to sound lke a rusticism all over\\nagain -\\njust as countrified and toothless as it was 100 years ago.\\n\\nhere are the stories new york times

happen,\\nand here\\'s how.\\n\\nif you haven\\'t gotten to plant your spring bulbs yet, keep a few\\nout. if you\\'ve planted them, by all means go buy a few more;\\nthey\\'re starting to hit the sale racks. the easiest to force are\\ndaffodils, narcissus, tulips, hyacinths or crocus.\\n\\nthe best ones to force are the earlier-season varieties; the\\nlater the variety, the taller it typically tends to grow. when you\\nare forcing bulbs indoors, taller often means top-heavy, or tipping\\nover.\\n\\nthe whole idea is to fool the bulb into thinking it has actually\\nspent its required number of days in the frozen garden. plan on\\nthis part taking a good 13 to 18 weeks, depending on the species.\\nduring this time, the bulbs will be developing their root system,\\nso you won\\'t see much, if any, green top growth.\\n\\nonce the recommended cold period has been reached, you can bring\\nthe bulbs indoors. the warmth will trick the bulb into thinking\\nspring has sprung, and within the first week, you will begin to see\\ngreen. within 10 to 14 more days, you should have color.\\n\\nso how exactly does all this happen? for starters, get the\\ncalendar out and count backward from the date you\\'d like to have\\nthe bulbs in bloom.\\n\\nfor example, hyacinths require a minimum of 13 weeks of cold\\ntreatment, then two more weeks or so of warmth before they bloom.\\nso figure on 15 weeks from planting time.\\n\\nnext step: pick a pot with drainage holes, and fill it about\\n2/3 full with a potting mix. steer clear of potting soil, as it\\ntends not to provide ample drainage. set the bulb pointed end up,\\nbasal end down and flat side facing toward the rim of the pot so\\nthe first leaf that grows will grow out over the rim of the pot. it\\njust looks nicer this way.\\n\\nthen cover with soil just over the bulb tip. water well. if\\nplanting numerous pots, be sure to tag each pot with the name of\\nthe bulbs and the date planted.\\n\\nmove the pots to a spot that won\\'t freeze but where the\\ntemperature will hover around 35 degrees. some ideas are a garage,\\nold refrigerator or unheated basement. i\\'ve had good luck under the\\nstairs of our bilco door; it\\'s below ground and mouse-proof.\\n\\nonce they\\'re in the cold treatment, do not water until the\\ncalendar says it\\'s ok to bring them indoors. if you are planting\\nmultiple pots of the same bulbs and would like to extend the bloom\\nperiod, stagger moving them in by intervals of 5 to 7 days. when\\nthe time arrives, bring them indoors and place them in a bright\\nlocation. don\\'t put them directly in a south -- or west -- facing\\nwindow, though; the heat on a sunny day can become too intense.\\n\\ntulips and paperwhite narcissus, sadly, are best tossed after\\nthey\\'ve bloomed. the others can be saved and planted in the garden\\ncome spring.\\n\\nthey won\\'t re-bloom the same spring, but should within 1-2\\nyears.\\n\\nonce daffodils, narcissus, hyacinths and crocus have bloomed,\\ncut the flower stalk off, leaving only the leaves, and let the\\nfoliage die naturally. keep watered as you would any other\\nhouseplant to prevent drying out, and wait until the soil outdoors\\nthaws. then plant so they can take advantage of the upcoming\\ngrowing season to replenish their stored food supply for next\\nspring\\'s bloom. mix in some bonemeal both spring and fall.\\n\\nas mentioned, each species requires its own cooling period.\\nhere\\'s a list of the most commonly forced bulbs:\\n\\ncrocus: 15 weeks\\n      daffodils and narcissus: 17 weeks\\n      grape hyacinths: 14 weeks\\n      hyacinths: 13 weeks\\n      tulips: 18 weeks\\n      paperwhite narcissus: 0 weeks\\n\\nyes, you read it right; paperwhites do not require pre-cooling\\nand will bloom about 3-5 weeks after planting. unless you already\\nhave planted these, the chances for a thanksgiving bloom are slim,\\nbut timing for christmas is on schedule.\\n\\npaperwhites are typically planted in a container filled with\\nsmall stones or bark chips and water. gently wiggle the bulbs into\\nthe stones -- keeping only the roots, not the entire bulb, in\\ncontact with water -- and place in bright light. you can plant the\\nother bulbs in stones rather than potting mix and then force\\naccording to the chart, but as with the paperwhites, discard after\\nbloom.\\n\\npotted bulbs make great homemade christmas gifts. just add\\ndirections as to how to finish the forcing steps and a picture of\\nwhat they will look like.\\n\\nhere\\'s to some colorful, snowy winter days.\\n\\n(nancy o\\'donnell owns perennial graphics nursery in\\nschaighticoke, n.y. contact her by e-mail at\\ndodonnell@nycap.rr.com. gardener\\'s notebook can be found online\\nat

the\\nseaside when the water is heating the rocks and you have this\\nperfume of sea salt. spain will taste like that,\" says the\\nrestaurateur and host of pbs\\'s \"made in spain.\"\\n\\nbut he\\'s just getting started.\\n\\n\"i could even argue that spain would smell, not like heavy\\nsmoke, but the smell and taste of the forest with the humidity and\\na touch of smoke in the air,\" andr?s muses as he shops the penn\\nquarter farmers market in washington, d.c., for his restaurant,\\nminibar.\\n\\n\"and, i would say it smells of history, like beautiful old\\ncookbooks.\"\\n\\ndespite its integral role in the early history of the new world\\n(remember the niña, the pinta and the santa maria?), spain, for\\nmany americans, might as well be an undiscovered country.\\n\\nandr?s aims to change that. he currently shares the pbs schedule\\nwith mario batali, best-known for his italian-themed restaurants,\\nbooks and television shows. batali\\'s \"spain ... on the road\\nagain,\" pairs him with oscar winner gwyneth paltrow, new york\\ntimes writer mark bittman and spanish actress claudia bassols as\\nthey gallivant around the iberian peninsula, drinking, eating and\\nlooking beautiful (the women, anyway).\\n\\nalthough they both celebrate the foods of the iberian peninsula,\\nthe shows differ in tone.\\n\\nthe batali-paltrow show feels a little like hanging out with the\\npopular kids in high school, except the bus is a mercedes benz and\\nthe cafeteria is a galician vineyard.\\n\\nlest the viewer think this is a beautifully filmed exercise in\\nvanity, both batali and paltrow lived in spain as teenagers and\\ntheir return road trip is a homecoming of sorts. their delight,\\nalong with bittman\\'s role as resident gruñon (grouch) and bassols\\'\\ngusto tempers the feeling that the viewer has intruded on an\\nexclusive vacation.\\n\\nit\\'s tempting to set up a rivalry between the two shows, but\\nneither host will bite. in fact, batali celebrated his birthday at\\nandr?s\\' six-seat minibar recently. \"jos? has the passion and the\\nability to translate to the home cook in his show,\" says batali by\\ncell phone from an airport (on his way to play golf with tiger\\nwoods -- seriously). \"both of them are going to succeed.\"\\n\\nandr?s the spaniard agrees, but makes it clear that he got there\\nfirst.\\n\\n\"my show started airing in february,\" says andr?s, who spent\\nnearly three years shooting his show, which is in its second season\\nnow. \"we were in different seasons waiting for saffron to open,\\nwaiting for the tuna to come or for the harvest of olive oil.\\nprobably for a cooking show we were very ambitious.\"\\n\\nambition and a sincere desire to share his native cuisine has\\npropelled andr?s\\' career since he crossed the atlantic 19 years ago\\nto work in new york after a stint with the famed innovator ferran\\nadri? at elbulli in northeastern spain.\\n\\nwith a successful television career in spain, five restaurants\\nin washington, d.c., and the bazaar in the new sls hotel opening in\\nbeverly hills, calif., this month, andr?s still has a sense of\\nmission about his work.\\n\\n\"my wife said, \\'you can go to spain and be a tv boy or go to\\namerica and use tv to spread your message.\\' it\\'s the ultimate way\\nto tell the story of my country through cooking, and not only in\\nthe kitchen. it\\'s about how powerful spanish gastronomy is, town by\\ntown, product by product. what i wanted to do was to plant the\\nseeds and make people want to know more.\"\\n\\nboth shows aim to pique viewers\\' interest in traveling to spain,\\nas they are sponsored in part by the spanish tourism office. and\\nthey\\'re sure to stimulate interest in exploring spanish flavors\\nhere at home.\\n\\nsomething about the landscape inspires the poet in batali too.\\n\\n\"things that grow together go together,\" he says as he grills\\nrosemary- and lavender-seasoned lamb chops over grapevine clippings\\nat valdub?n vineyard in one episode. \"everything about this whole\\ndinner is from 250 yards from here. that is poetry on the planet.\"\\n\\nbatali, best-known for his italian repertoire, says spanish food\\nshares the region\\'s cultural and geographic roots. \"it\\'s similar\\nin its mediterranean-ness to italian, greek and southern french\\nfood. they just rely on rice

union states were\\nconfident the war would end at any moment. union armies were\\nmassing around richmond, va., the confederate capital, and were in\\na much better position to cut supply lines to rebel armies than\\nvice versa.\\n\\nby the end of 1862, the confederate army under robert e. lee not\\nonly had advanced close to washington, creating alarm over the\\npossible loss of the nation\\'s capital, but the union was having\\nserious trouble finding new military recruits. the war\\'s end was\\nnowhere in sight.\\n\\nhistorian william marvel, winner of the lincoln prize and the\\ndouglas southall freeman award, devotes his newest civil war volume\\nto this swing in momentum.\\n\\n\"lincoln\\'s darkest year\" is the second in marvel\\'s planned\\nfour-volume civil\\n\\nwar tome, the first being \"mr. lincoln goes to war.\"\\n\\nmarvel has gathered exhaustive supplies of new source materials\\nupon which to build his series of books: newspaper accounts,\\ngovernment documents, letters and diaries from all corners of the\\nunion and the south.\\n\\nthe result, especially in \"lincoln\\'s darkest year,\" is a\\ncataloging of this material. the information is interesting, but\\nthere\\'s too much of it with few guideposts to shape the civil war\\nstory of 1862 into a cohesive story.\\n\\nthe book seems aimed at other historians more than to the\\ngeneral reader.\\n\\nmarvel is a fine researcher and craftsman, but he is no david\\nmccullough. anyone who read mccullough\\'s fine \"1776,\" about the\\nstart of the american\\n\\nrevolution, can appreciate good storytelling. mccullough knows\\nhow to use strong characters and actions to guide readers to an\\nadvanced understanding of everything at stake in wartime.\\n\\nthat aspect is missing in \"lincoln\\'s darkest year.\" even\\nlincoln comes off as a stick figure as he weighs whether to issue\\nthe emancipation proclamation while trying to determine which\\ngenerals to trust and whether to intervene in military matters.\\n\\nunion generals, especially gen. george mcclellan, with his\\nconstant indecision in the field, frustrated lincoln, but there\\'s\\nlittle sense of the drama that must have played out in the white\\nhouse.\\n\\nmarvel delivers much new material, especially about the\\nrecruitment of union soldiers and the sad plight of military\\nhorses, but he doesn\\'t connect those to the overall story.\\n\\nthe battles of antietam and fredericksburg, both resulting in\\nmassive casualties, are described in detail. the reader ought to be\\nable to hear the roar of the battle and see men falling to cannon\\nand rifle fire, but marvel, concentrating on maneuvers, misses the\\ndrama.\\n\\n(david hendricks is an express-news business columnist. e-mail:\\ndhendricks@express-news.net.)\\n\\nthe english chef simon hopkinson wears his crown\\nlightly. after being anointed author of the \"most useful cookbook\\nof all time\" in 2005 for his work \"roast chicken and other\\nstories\" by a panel of his british food-world peers, he might have\\ncracked under the pressure: retired from the field, succumbed to\\ncrippling writer\\'s block or indulged in some scandalous behavior,\\nlike endorsing a line of frozen entrees.\\n\\ninstead, he sleeps like a baby, eats like a lord and has written\\nan even juicier sequel, just published in the united states,\\n\"second helpings of roast chicken\" (hyperion).\\n\\n\"\\'useful\\' is certainly the title i would have wanted to win,\"\\nhe said with satisfaction last week.\\n\\ncookbooks can be transporting, instructive, enthralling and\\ncomforting, but useful ones are surprisingly rare -- most produce\\none or two reliable dishes at best. both \"roast chicken\" books,\\nhowever, seem to exert a magnetic force that drags even burned-out\\ncooks to try recipe after recipe.\\n\\ndivided into chapters by main ingredient -- cream, chocolate,\\npeas, steak -- the books are characterized by hopkinson\\'s sensible\\nadvice and unerring food sense. \"i go to the market and see people\\nscooping up carrots labeled organic,\" he said, peeling furiously\\nduring a recent cooking session in manhattan. \"but they\\'re just\\nold, all soft and limp. organic nothing, you don\\'t want those\\ncarrots.\"\\n\\nhopkinson first became famous as the opening chef for bibendum,\\na top restaurant

(when the restaurant opened in 1987, his\\ninclusion of the prosaic fish and chips on the menu caused \"an\\nabsolute sensation,\" said rowley leigh, chef at le cafe anglais in\\nlondon.)\\n\\napril bloomfield, the chef at the spotted pig in the west\\nvillage, cooked under him at bibendum. \"simon was really convinced\\nthat you should cook things that you love, not things that are\\nfancy or that customers expect to see on the menu of a certain kind\\nof restaurant,\" she said. \"everything he made, he made\\nperfectly.\"\\n\\nfor the record, hopkinson denies being a perfectionist. \"what\\nis all the sieving and straining for?\" he asked during a\\ndiscussion of cream soups. \"all this striving after perfection,\\nand to what end?\" however, he is driven nearly mad by carelessly\\npeeled potatoes, badly washed lettuce and what he views as mindless\\ninnovation. \"why on earth would anyone put cumin in mint sauce for\\nlamb, or a caesar dressing on bibb lettuce?\" he asked, wincing in\\ngenuine pain. \"there\\'s no reason for it.\"\\n\\nhopkinson began cooking professionally at the age of 16, not out\\nof financial necessity or on a whim but, he says, because his\\nparents simply couldn\\'t keep him out of the kitchen any longer.\\n\\nlike many chefs, he seems to have total food recall, remembering\\nalmost every dish to come out of his mother\\'s kitchen in the 1960s:\\nwell-made british classics and french \"party food,\" with some\\ndaring provencal experiments when the writer elizabeth david began\\nto nudge the cool, dairy-loving british palate to explore the\\ngarlic-rich environment of the mediterranean.\\n\\nhe began his career in a firmly french kitchen in the firmly\\nbritish town of birtle, opened his own (french) restaurant in wales\\nin 1975, one month before his 21st birthday, and in 1983 opened the\\nfrench restaurant in london, hilaire, that began to make his\\nreputation for grace and precision.\\n\\nunlike many british chefs, \"i never felt the need to work in\\nfrance,\" he said. \"my country needed me.\"\\n\\nhe was born in 1954, into a nation renowned as a gastronomic\\nwasteland of overcooked vegetables, insipid sauces and baby-food\\ntextures. but hopkinson is a sentimental cook, nostalgic even for\\nmuch-reviled \"school food.\"\\n\\n\"the mince at my school wasn\\'t half bad, you know,\" he said.\\nnot to be confused with mincemeat, mince is a kind of english\\nsloppy joe without the bun. in hopkinson\\'s hands, ground beef is\\ncooked down with onions, carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes and spices\\ninto a savory, tangy, delicious slop.\\n\\nlike many chefs who now describe their food as \"modern\\nbritish,\" hopkinson has had to dig deep to find truly british\\nrecipes.\\n\\n\"simon will make apple hat with a suet crust, a pretty dull and\\nstodgy dish in most hands,\" leigh said. \"and he will make it\\nexquisitely.\" his st. clement\\'s cream, a fragrant, lightly set\\norange-lemon custard, evolved from british milk possets (the\\nfruits\\' acid thickens the cream, eliminating any need for eggs or\\ncornstarch to make it set).\\n\\nchapters on brains, butter and dripping, suet, kidneys, and\\ncustard reflect his conviction that traditional british cooking,\\nbefore being mucked up by ignorant enthusiasms for extra virgin\\nolive oil and chili peppers, could hold its head high among world\\ncuisines.\\n\\nhopkinson has loosened up since the first \"roast chicken\"\\nbook, and now digs his fangs into lazy home cooks, show-off\\nrestaurant chefs and know-it-all food writers with equal energy.\\n\\n\"something seems ever so slightly wrong in the state of the\\nhome kitchen, just now,\" he writes. \"we watch endless cooking\\nshows but prefer, finally, to spend lots of money on prepared\\nsupermarket meals while idly turning the pages of (spotlessly\\nclean) cookbooks until the microwave pings.\" (ouch.)\\n\\nhe admits to some similar habits, for example with his own\\ncelebrated caramel ice cream recipe. \"i haven\\'t made mine since\\nhaagen-dazs came out with their dulce de leche,\" he said.\\n\"they\\'ve achieved perfection;

unusual chocolate entrepreneurs.\\n\\ncesar and magdalena dahua grow cacao, along with pineapples,\\nvanilla, avocados, cassava, coffee, oranges and plantains. as they\\nhack off the football-shaped fruit of the cacao trees, their three\\nyoungest daughters run barefoot nearby. the girls stop to suck the\\nsticky white pulp that envelops the cacao beans in the pods. it\\ntastes like sour patch candies.\\n\\nfor quechua people like the dahuas, cacao has always been a\\ntreat -- the pulp a tart candy and the purple bean, when ground to a\\npaste and mixed with hot water and a little sugar, a rustic hot\\nchocolate.\\n\\nbut mostly, the beans were a commodity, sold for about 20 cents\\na pound to men who would bring them to the port of guayaquil. from\\nthere they would be shipped around the world to be turned into\\nmass-produced chocolate. every once in a while the quechua might\\neven taste it.\\n\\nbut the quechua grew tired of making such a meager living from\\nso highly valued a product. with the help of volunteers they\\neliminated the middlemen and created their own chocolate. now\\nkallari bars (pronounced kai-yah-ri) -- named for the cooperative\\nthey formed -- are being sold throughout the united states. people\\nin the chocolate industry said they knew of no other cacao farmers\\nwho were making and marketing their own chocolate.\\n\\nthe cooperative uses an unusual blend of cacaos that grow on the\\nquechua land -- fruity cacao amazonico, nutty criollo, forastero\\namazonico, tipo trinitario and, most important, a rare variety that\\nflourishes around their homes, cacao nacional.\\n\\n\"they have a certain smell and taste that is herbal, flowery\\nbut also savory, like black pepper,\" tomas keme, a swiss chocolate\\nexpert who consults for kallari, said of the cacao nacional beans.\\n\"it\\'s the same taste i find in a californian cabernet.\"\\n\\nthe chocolate is smooth, rich and straightforward. the\\n2.47-ounce bars, in 75 and 85 percent cacao, sell for as much as\\n$5.99 at whole foods.\\n\\nto become chocolate-makers, the quechua first had to decide to\\nbe more than just farmers. but they didn\\'t have the knowledge or\\nexperience.\\n\\n\"we wanted change,\" said carlos pozo, kallari\\'s marketing\\ndirector, \"but we didn\\'t have the capital or anyone who would\\ntrust us.\"\\n\\nthen in 1997 they met judy logback, a lanky kansan with wild\\nblond hair who was volunteering for a foundation promoting\\nbiodiversity in ecuador.\\n\\n\"i didn\\'t show up with a plan,\" logback said. \"i asked them\\nwhat they wanted.\" pozo and others said they wanted to sell\\ndirectly at markets and learn how to grow better, more desirable\\ncacao. they wanted to find a way to survive and thrive as they\\nfaced pressure from companies that sought to log their hardwood\\ntrees, drill on their land for oil and mine for gold.\\n\\nlogback first helped them take their beans more than 250 miles\\nto guayaquil.\\n\\n\"we received threats that the intermediaries would rob or\\nhijack our trucks,\" pozo said. \"in the first years, kallari was\\nso united that the intermediaries realized they could not break\\nthrough this union.\"\\n\\nthey watched their profits from cacao more than double as they\\ngot 48 cents a pound in guayaquil.\\n\\nfour years later, they established kallari, which in quechua\\nmeans both \"to begin\" and \"the early times.\" the name seemed\\nfitting, pozo said: \"in the present, we are valuing our past.\"\\nwith logback\\'s help, the cooperative now includes about 850\\nfamilies.\\n\\n\"judy really sacrificed a lot for us,\" said elias alvarado,\\nkallari\\'s director of production and natural resources. \"the\\npeople in the communities really love her for what she has done.\"\\n\\nas their confidence grew, they decided to sell their cacao\\ndirectly to big league chocolate-makers. they e-mailed makers in\\nnorth america, attracting the interest of robert steinberg, a\\nfounder of scharffen berger chocolate in berkeley, calif. but\\nsteinberg said that before he could use the beans they needed to be\\nproperly fermented, a process that brings out fruit and floral\\nflavors and reduces astringency.\\n\\nlogback hired jorge ruiz, who had worked for a cacao cooperative\\non the coast, to teach the quechua fermentation. before his\\narrival, the quechua had only fermented their beans inadvertently,\\nwhen they piled them up before drying. ruiz taught them to create\\nfermentation boxes and to monitor temperatures.\\n\\nin october 2004, steinberg made a chocolate bar with kallari\\nbeans and helped them present it at the terra madre conference of\\nthe slow food group in turin, italy. later that year they met\\nofficials from the swiss chocolate company felchlin, who agreed to\\npay them 94 cents a pound for their beans.\\n\\ninspired by their success, logback and pozo told kallari elders\\nthat they should start making chocolate.\\n\\n\"they all thought we were crazy,\" pozo said. \"we don\\'t know\\nanything about this market, what kind of people would buy it, how\\nto make it.\"\\n\\nchocolate-making has always been less common in cacao-producing\\ncountries than it has been in europe, where the technology to\\ncreate chocolate bars was developed and where such a luxury could\\nbe more easily afforded.\\n\\nwith a formula from steinberg, who died in september, and heavy\\nbushels of cacao, they traveled 12 hours by bus to a shabby\\ncommunity-owned factory in the andean hill town of salinas de\\nguaranda. there they made the first kallari bars.\\n\\n\"i was confused a bit by what i believed to be chocolate,\"\\nsaid alvarado, who had eaten only cheap commercial milk chocolate\\nbefore he tried the kallari bars. \"now i realize after all these\\nyears that i was eating something that wasn\\'t really chocolate.\"\\n\\nby tasting it, they could understand their role in the finished\\nproduct. they improved their farming practices and bean\\nfermentation. over 500 families received organic status, which was\\nnot difficult, since most never had the money for fertilizers or\\nother chemicals.\\n\\nit was difficult, though, to perfect their chocolate production\\nat such a crude facility. in the spring of 2007, stephen mcdonnell,\\nthe founder and chief executive of the applegate farms organic food\\ncompany, and his wife, jill, met kallari members through their\\ndaughter nora, who visited the napo region with her seventh-grade\\nclass.\\n\\nwith kallari\\'s permission and $250,000, mcdonnell established\\nthe kallari chocolate co., which lists him as the owner for\\nliability and insurance reasons. all of the profits, though, go\\nback to the kallari cooperative.\\n\\nmcdonnell hired keme to teach the collective about bean quality\\nand techniques of swiss chocolate-making. he also hired a larger,\\nmore efficient chocolate factory in quito, the capital of ecuador,\\nto produce the bars based on standards set by keme and pozo. (the\\nchocolate made in salinas, less refined and slightly acidic, is\\nsold in some health food stores as kallari\\'s sacha bar.) mcdonnell\\nasked the farmers to focus on their farming and to master the\\nfermentation of their beans, which the company now buys from\\nkallari for as much as $1.95 a pound, an astronomical price for the\\naverage cacao farmer cooperative.\\n\\n(paradoxically, kallari does not have fair trade certification,\\nsince it would cost 10 cents per pound of beans and it seemed\\nunfair for kallari to pay a fee for its own beans.)\\n\\nmcdonnell has taken a chance, but he says he is not concerned.\\n\\n\"the kallari people have pride in their farms,\" he said, \"and\\nare transferring that pride into their bar.\"\\n\\nplans for their own chocolate factory are in the works,\\nmcdonnell hopes that within three to five years a board of kallari\\ndirectors can assume most of his duties.\\n\\nkallari farmers also hope to diversify to continue living\\nsustainably off their land. they are planting balsa trees, which\\ngrow rapidly, to sell to windmill-makers, and they want to promote\\nagritourism.\\n\\n\"there was a dream that seemed impossible,\" pozo said. \"now\\nwe believe there are so many possibilities open to us.\"\\n\\nauthor allia zobel nolan hopes her latest book can serve as a\\ntool for parents, caretakers and educators who are looking for a\\nway to talk with children about diversity.\\n\\n\"since the world is such a diverse place, and small children\\nget to mix with others who aren\\'t like they are at a very young\\nage, i think it\\'s important for parents to have dialogues with\\ntheir children explaining that people come in all shapes and sizes,\\ncolors and nationalities,\" she says, adding, \"and that\\'s a good\\nthing and that it would be pretty boring if we all looked and acted\\nthe same.\"\\n\\nnolan released \"one special me: a book celebrating how god made\\nus special\" last month to coincide with national diversity month,\\nbut she says the book covers an issue that has a long shelf life.\\n\\n\"learning to appreciate diversity helps us in all phases of\\nlife. if we go through life thinking that because something is\\ndifferent, it\\'s bad, we aren\\'t letting ourselves experience the\\nexciting, interesting and intriguing expansiveness of the world.\\nbut if we take the attitude that differences are what makes the\\nworld a special place, that being different doesn\\'t make anything\\nbetter or worse ... it just makes it different ... we\\'d all get\\nalong a better.\"\\n\\nshe says she also believes that kind of attitude would encourage\\npeople to seek more diverse experiences and knock down barriers\\nthat never had to exist in the first place.\\n\\nzobel nolan, who has written more than 150 books, was a senior\\neditor in the religious books department of reader\\'s digest\\nchildren\\'s publishing, in pleasantville, n.y. she says she left\\nthat job in april 2007 to concentrate on other writing projects.\\n\\n\"one special me\" is an interactive book, providing young\\nreaders with plenty to do beyond read, such as pull at flip-up\\nflaps and spin wheels. zobel nolan also included an \"i\\'m\\nspecial,\" ribbon that children can wear.\\n\\nshe is hopeful \"one special me,\" with illustrations by pauline\\nsiewert, will teach younger children to be tolerant and accepting\\nof themselves and others.\\n\\n\"i want them to learn that\\'s it\\'s ok for them to be who they\\nare ... the way god made them -- special -- whether it\\'s short or\\ntall, plump or thin, whether they have red hair and freckles, or\\ncurly hair in corn rows.\"\\n\\nshe says she also hopes the book provides the lesson, or at\\nleast provokes discussion that it also is ok for others to be who\\nthey are. by highlighting that no two people are alike, she says\\ndifferences would be celebrated, rather than mocked. children and\\nadults would embrace the diversity, she says, rather than shy away\\nfrom it.\\n\\n\"i think kids feel pressure to \\'fit in,\\' to be like everyone\\nelse. personally, i think that does a child a disservice because we\\ndon\\'t want to raise a generation of clones ... we want our children\\nto be themselves ... to establish their own identities and\\npersonalities. we want them to be the best person they can be,\\nwhatever that is, not a bad imitation of someone else.\"\\n\\nsupreme court justices spent an hour tuesday\\ndiscussing dirty words without uttering a single one or revealing\\nany clues about whether they would back a government crackdown on\\nbroadcasters who aired the expletives.\\n\\nat issue is the validity of the federal communications\\ncommission\\'s 2004 decision to stop tolerating the one-time,\\nfleeting use of dirty words on air and instead begin punishing\\nbroadcasters who don\\'t bleep the expletives during live shows.\\n\\nthe fcc adopted its policy to consider fines beginning at\\n$325,000 for what the broadcast industry and the commission call\\n\"fleeting expletives\" after celebrities cursed during the live\\nbroadcasts of 2003 golden globes awards ceremony and the 2002 and\\n2003 billboard music awards.\\n\\nduring one of the broadcasts, singer bono said on-air that it\\nwas \"really f---ing brilliant\" to get an award. during another\\nshow, celebrity nicole richie said it was \"not so f---ing simple .\\n. . to get cow s--- out of a prada purse.\"\\n\\nfox television stations and other broadcasters successfully\\nchallenged the new policy before the u.s. court of appeals for the\\n2nd circuit, which ruled last year that the fcc\\'s change had been\\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" and therefore violated federal law.\\nthe fcc appealed to the high court.\\n\\nduring oral arguments tuesday, lawyers and justices inside the\\nsupreme court repeatedly relied on the euphemisms of \"the s-word\"\\nand \"the f-word,\" but carefully avoided their colorful originals.\\n\\nthe expletives have \"shocking value,\" noted chief justice john\\nroberts. the words are \"associated with sexual or excretory\\nactivity,\" he said. \"that\\'s what gives (them) force.\"\\n\\nassociate justice antonin scalia complained about a\\n\"coarsening\" of society and said fox and other broadcasters had\\nsomething \"to do with that.\"\\n\\nother justices signaled they were more comfortable with the\\noccasional swear word. sometimes they can be used in a way that is\\n\"really hilarious, very, very funny,\" and \"you can\\'t help but\\nlaugh,\" noted justice john paul stevens.\\n\\nassociate justice stephen breyer observed that \"you deal with a\\ncross-section of humanity\" at sporting events and on televised\\nawards shows, \"and my experience is some parts of that\\ncross-section swear.\"\\n\\nthe case also involves the first amendment\\'s right to free\\nspeech -- and the constitutionality of the fcc\\'s power to police the\\nairwaves.\\n\\nthe court has invalidated government indecency regulations for\\ncable television and the internet, limiting the fcc\\'s power to the\\npublic airwaves.\\n\\nreferring to the first amendment application to the fcc case,\\nassociate justice ruth bader ginsburg said it was \"the big\\nelephant in the room.\" one possible outcome in the appeal is that\\nthe justices would send the case back to a lower court to consider\\nthe broader constitutional question of whether fcc regulation runs\\nafoul of the first amendment.\\n\\nu.s. solicitor general gregory garre urged the justices to\\nsupport the commission, saying its decision to go after fleeting\\nexpletives was \"reasoned\" and \"rational.\"\\n\\ngarre warned that if unchecked and unregulated, networks would\\nbe \"free to use expletives . . . 24 hours a day,\" and that could\\nlead to \"big bird dropping the f-bomb on \\'sesame street.\\' \"\\n\\n\"americans who want to get indecent programming can go to cable\\ntv (and) can go to the internet,\" garre said. broadcast television\\nis \"the one place where americans can turn on the tv at 8 o\\'clock\\nand watch their dinner and not be expected to be bombarded with\\nindecent language, either in an isolated basis or a repeated\\nbasis.\"\\n\\ncarter phillips, the attorney representing fox, said that unlike\\nother government actions, the fcc \"isn\\'t regulating the price of\\noil in a pipeline.\"\\n\\n\"at the end of the day,\" he said, \"you are regulating the\\ncontent of speech\" -- and the fcc\\'s decisions to pursue fleeting\\nexpletives have a \"chilling effect\" on broadcasters.\\n\\nalthough some broadcasters briefly delay live sporting events\\nand awards shows so they have time to bleep out any vulgarities,\\nphillips said the cost of tape-delay systems -- and the employees\\nneeded to man them -- may be prohibitive for smaller stations.\\nrather than risk airing an expletive and getting penalized by the\\nfcc, smaller stations may opt against broadcasting local sporting\\nevents or political debates altogether, phillips said.\\n\\nin determining whether to punish broadcasters, the five-member\\nfcc considers the context surrounding indecencies and evaluates\\nwhether that violates prevailing community standards.\\n\\nginsburg complained that the context-based decisions can be\\ncapricious. she cited the fcc\\'s decision not to rap broadcasters\\nfor airing the war movie \"saving private ryan,\" despite\\nexpletives in the film.\\n\\n\"there seems to be no rhyme or reason when the commission says\\nthat one of these words is okay and when it says it isn\\'t.\"\\n\\na decision in the case is expected by july.\\n\\n(jennifer a. dlouhy can be reached at
